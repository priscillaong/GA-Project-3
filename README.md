#Problem Statement
We are a team of Data Analyst at ABC consultancy working together with CHAT to improve their webCHAT email platform for youths to get support for emotional concerns. <br>

Based on the emails received from chat@mentalhealth.sg, we want to accurately assign them into "anxiety" or "depression" and allow the counsellors to provide them the necessary support and resources.

This project aims to:<br>
(i) Use the reviews from Reddit for r/Anxiety and r/depression and apply modelling to predict if they fall under the anxiety or depression subreddit.<br>
(ii) Find out the words commonly used by each communities.
