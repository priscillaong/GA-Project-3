Anxiety,My ex friend said me having anxiety is abusive towards my boyfriend,"Um hi i’m new to the sub and hoped someone could give me an unbiased opinion on this.

So my ex friend (A) and I had a falling out after they said they didn’t want to talk to me anymore because of something traumatic that happened to me recently. And their reason was that my trauma, traumatized them. But when I tried to tell them that that upset me they called me manipulative and toxic so I blocked then which was probably stupid of me.

We have a mutual friend (B), and yesterday they went to my boyfriend (who this friend is also friends with) to talk about it and check up on him. My boyfriend knew of the falling out and told me that A told B that I was abusive towards my boyfriend due to me having anxiety. 

Some examples are that I have a huge fear of him cheating on me so he lets me know with who he talks to if I ask (he’s allowed the same). I also have agoraphobia(fear of being in public spaces) so when I have to go somewhere he comes with me most of the time.

Even though he was the one to suggest these things, i am now really scared that i’m being controlling or even worse. Friend B agrees with A but my boyfriend says he doesn’t. 

I don’t want to make it about me but this has strongly affected me and i’ve started isolating myself from everyone and idk what to do."
Anxiety,Just wanted to share,"Hey everyone , so my anxiety has been up to
a all time high for a various reasons.. But i just wanted to share something that really helped me. So when i get very anxious i have a very tight feeling of pressure in my chest, and something i realized that helps me get rid of that is literally just sitting down in a nice hot shower, not a bath but with the shower running. Eases my anxiety a ten fold. Just wanted to share and hope this helps somebody. I’m looking to try more natural methods then pills and weed, i feel that those are only a temporary fix."
Anxiety,Anxious about polygraph at work,"  

I managed to get out of my old, toxic job and got an amazing job at a new company, starting last week. I am currently in my probationary period. 

Now the new work routinely asks for a polygraph test of all new employees.  I received the test this morning with a group of other staff. The stress felt overwhelming, so much so that at one point I felt that I would pass out. I am terrified that I failed my polygraph because of my anxiety and that it is just a matter of time before I get fired. The person who gave the test either doesn’t have the results yet or can’t discuss them with me so I have no idea how it went.

I have to get on with my work, but I feel like crying at my desk with how scared and anxious I am.

(Small note on polygraphs in my country: They are inadmissible in court or even to dismiss someone from a job, but employers may use them before employing someone or during their probation and may choose to not extend a person’s contract or make them a permanent employee.)"
Anxiety,DAE get waves of vertigo even when sitting or laying down?,"Vertigo has been one of my main symptoms of anxiety for ages. For me it was never like the room is spinning, but like I'm on a boat or on an elevator right as it comes to a stop (basically, like my head ducks down while the ground moves up).

Recently though, I'll get the occasional wave while sitting down or even laying down (the latter much more rarely, but it does happen). CT scan I got ~a month ago (after passing out - turns out chronically low BP means I'm prone to vasovagal syncope, yay) says everything is fine and I have an appointment with an ENT scheduled, but it's a month out, and I do have a referral for and MRI too, it's just not scheduled yet, so I do have all the ""go see a doctor"" tips covered 😉.

Anyways,  this post is just to see if anyone else has experienced this to help calm me down in the long wait for an appointment."

Anxiety,Chest pain from anxiety?,"Two days ago I was feeling ok in the morning but around lunchtime the area around my heart started to hurt. Of course, pain around your heart is gonna give you anxiety, so it started to hurt more!
I got so scared I was so close to calling EMS to go to the hospital. 

But since I started having anxiety a lot more lately, I looked it up and wanted to see if it was connected to anything, to my surprise and relief, it is!?
Anxiety gives you chest pains?!? Is there nothing that anxiety DOESN’T make hurt?!? Why does it have to make the area around your heart hurt that gives you MORE ANXIETY!?!?! 

I have some muscle soothing patches that make the area it’s on cool and hurt less, but it feels like it doesn’t do much, or nothing at all. 

Does anyone have any advice to ease my anxiety and pain? If it doesn’t change tomorrow I’m gonna see a doctor about it. Even though one of my fears is getting put on a bunch of medications."
Anxiety,Anxiety relapse,"Been struggling with my anxiety now for new 4 years on and off but this weekend my body just decided to give me hell with it.

Just wish there was a way to turn this all off, if only for a little bit"
Anxiety,Whats the Good way to tell my Overprotective parents about me using Discord behind there backs because of Anxiety?,"Basically I use Discord for things like being in servers related to games I play and art and my Parents don’t like me using anything to talk to strangers due to the dangers obviously even though I know what to look out for and wouldn’t get myself into any danger on purpose and that being on Discord helps me Distract myself from Bad Anxiety.

But Ive never told them I use Discord as Ive made great friends either 2-3years older or younger then me who cause nothing bad to happen to happen and aren’t anyone suspicious or creepy and that I wouldn’t want to loose those friends as in real life Ive struggled a-lot to make friends or to be social in the past and that Ive been able to learn about the games I like to play through others people who play the same games.

Ive been told to stop before when being caught a couple times and I tried but I couldn’t because of the friendships I had made and now that I’m 18 I feel like Im a responsible young adult and that my parents should trust me when using Discord.

Im just scared that if I told them I could loose everything on Discord even though its a positive thing that I use Discord for things I like and it could help me improve on skills for me like art for example.

Even considering just opening up to my parents about all this just so I wouldn’t have to hide anything as the whole reason I joined Discord was due to bad Social anxiety over the years and it helped me get through l a-lot of things.

I tend to get very bad anxiety about this to the point I feel sick when talking to my parents about these types of things as I have no idea on how they would respond or react causing me feel more nervous.

And I basically have no idea how to cope with the Anxiety when telling my parents about this as I know it will be alot to handle emotionally."
Anxiety,Are you also too anxious to sleep? Come say hi!,"Hello, fellow nighttime anxiety friends. If you guys want to chat in this thread as a distraction, go right ahead! You can say anything you want. I'll go first. I've been lying in bed trying to sleep for so long, but I'm too anxious. So allow me to tell you guys about the scones I hope to make sometime soon. I've never made them before, but I love scones so much. I found a recipe for blueberry scones with a lemon glaze, and I hope they taste as good as they sound. I'm going to get all the ingredients for them this week and hopefully bake them on the weekend."

Anxiety,I'm (26f) always creating scenarios in my head about my relationship and it hurts," 

Hello everyone (again),

I'm writing this because I've read almost everything in Google at this point and I can't be helped. Or I can't help myself. I'm currently in a relationship, fairly new. We've known each other for three months and made it official 2 weeks ago. This is my third relationship. Just a bit of context: my second relationship, my last one, was really complicated. I was with someone narcissistic who really ruined a bit of me. I already had fear of abandonment but it got worse as, after 2 years of dating, he said I love you in the night and the morning after told me ""I don't love you anymore."" WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION, BOTH OF US, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. After a few realizations I told my therapist I suffered a bit of narcissistic abuse and I think I have a bit of PTSD.

Now I've met this guy, after 10 months of me and my ex broke up, and it has been amazing. He's the kindest human being I know. He's very honest (it seems - because my mind keeps telling me he's lying) and super nice and always makes sure he reassures me whenever I'm anxious, sad, or scared. It was really difficult in the beginning to even give him a bit of me and be vulnerable. But now that I've put my walls down so many fears are overcoming my head. I have this fear that his ex will come and ruin the relationship, begging him to come back (I have talked to him about this and he has said that they ended because it was HORRIBLE at the end and both knew it didn't work anymore. And we had a very mature conversation where he said that he wants to be with me that's why he wants to be in a relationship, to begin with, because if he wanted her he wouldn't even be meeting people let alone be in a relationship. The past is in the past and now I'm who's important to him). I'm really scared of that because in the past an ex was more important than me. Then I'm terrified he will stop liking me because I'm a very anxious person. The bottom of the question is that I'm terrified of hurting myself and looking ridiculous for giving someone a chance and breaking up a month after for example. And the more kind and warm he is to me every time I am like this, the more scared and ashamed I become.

And I know, if I'm here is because I know he likes me and I like him and if I accepted to be in a relationship I should just believe 100% in the person I'm in and hope for a bright future. But as I said I keep making scenarios every day and starting to get anxious and I can't keep asking for reassurance. I need strategies. (Yes I'm in therapy!)

Do you have any advice? Kind words? Strategies? A SLAP IN THE FACE FOR ME TO STOP SPIRALING."
Anxiety,I’m scared of dropping out of university but I don’t know what else to do. TW,"I’ve started crying every for about 6 hours a day since starting uni and I can’t sleep at all the nights before my lectures because because I’m way too anxious. When I’m there I don’t want to speak to anyone and I don’t want them to look at or speak to me. The whole day I’m there all i think about is going home or ending my life. I’ve also started self harming again. Every week we have to give presentations and i physically can’t do it, the first time i tried I couldn’t even get a single word out and the teacher just told me it’s okay i can sit down cause i was shaking so bad and on the verge of tears. My mum told me it’s okay to drop out but my dad is pissed and keeps saying going university will help my mental health and that i just need to be positive. I dunno if I should just keep going because i just don’t know what to do otherwise."
Anxiety,I feel like the healthcare system failed me for not catching my anxiety sooner and now I’m stuck,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I remember and I’ve been socially isolated since elementary school (being the kid with no friends) I started developing severe anxiety in middle school I talked to my doctor and a therapist but found no solace or help my doctor handed me a piece of paper with check boxes the ones that are like never, sometimes, often always, and she also handed me one for depression but after looking at them for 2 seconds she basically told me you don’t have anxiety because you’re not depressed, and then I got a therapist which then downplayed my anxiety symptoms and told me I didn’t have anxiety because I don’t experience panic attacks, I told him I did have panic attacks during school, he then says it’s not a panic attack because I don’t run out of the classroom when experiencing it (also what kind of reasoning is that not everyone is going to do that for me I would leave the classroom if I could but I just wouldn’t run out like I’m already thinking about if I’d get sent to detention for leaving class or what other people would think and how It’d be embarrassing) I’ve never been officially diagnosed for anxiety and my mother was never really any help during these times she wasn’t really a good parent if I had to be honest, I came to her multiple times to take me to another doctor or therapist because I need help and she would shrug it off I got really depressed during high school and told her I wanted to kill myself during an argument and she said “talk to the school counselor then”, I’m 18 currently and my anxiety has gotten worse and worse ever since and I’ve never gotten any help I’m lost and I want to get help but I’m not even sure if I’m still on my mothers health insurance plan and I can’t call the health insurance provider to find out because of my anxiety, i struggle with making phone calls and it’s very hard to explain that to the people around me who say “just make this or that phone call” because it’s not that easy, it’s very difficult for me to talk to people I can’t look people in the face when talking to them like I use to, and I can only say a few words I can’t have a full conversation, when I’m experiencing terrible anxiety in a social situation where I have to talk to people I’ll start to have auditory hallucinations, my mouth is super dry, and I sweat like crazy, I hate being in super crowded and loud spaces because I’ll start to panic, I recently had to go to the grocery store and for some reason it was just jam packed with toddlers screaming everywhere I was so overwhelmed I pretty much ran out with only half of what I needed and started crying in the car. I feel so stuck and I feel betrayed by the health system and everyone around me for not helping me when my anxiety started when I was younger, I really wish that I was treated for my anxiety when I was at that young age because I wouldn’t be stuck where I’m at now"
Anxiety,Poor Nail Health,"Hi all

Has anyone notices a correlation between their finger nail health and their mental health?

Any help 

Thanks"
Anxiety,Anybody else get that ''something snapped in my brain'' feeling and a overwhelming sense of dread afterwards?,"I've been able to control my anxiety and my panic attacks recently, but once in a while I get this really scary and strange feeling in my brain where something snaps and I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

Anxiety,"Good god, hangover anxiety is unreal. How do people deal with this?","Does anyone else get absolutely insane 'beer fear' / 'hangxiety' after a night of heavy drinking?

It's been a day now and I'm still worried I did something horrific that I don't remember doing and am wandering around coming up with scenarios in my head for what *could* have happened despite logically knowing that it couldn't in reality.

I'm walking around reassuring myself that I didn't do anything nuts.

How do you break the cycle of panic / intrusive thoughts?"
Anxiety,I'm so scared.,"I don't know how I'm going to be alive much longer with my health and health phobia. I just woke up after sleeping a day away. Feel so tired and depressed, all of my anxiety is back. I'm feeling sick too and can barely walk I feel so weak. 

My eyes look like I got beat up they are so black and doomy looking. I cant even remember when I last took my medications or if I did. I can't remember the last two days even though I posted on this exact board like 300 times. I just want to break down and cry, I have no contact with and family or friends, and my wife is slowly giving up on me after 14 years. 

I just turned 30 and I feel like a lost child. I can't do things normal people can do my age. It's always a joke about how slow I am and how I can't remember anything, but I know it's all from decades of anxiety and depression slowly degrading my brain. I also have permanent long-term damage from past benzo abuse, I forget my ABC's and can barely string together sentences irl.

I'm going to do a rapid Covid test later to make sure I'm not sick. It would be a relief to know this feeling is coming from a sickness and not my mind. I feel so f'ing hopeless and drained. 

No I am not suicidal any would not self-harm. If anything the opposite, I'm desperate for my health and sanity back. Going to a Dr is not in question ever. I will die before facing my fear of medical treatment, a decade of every single type of possible help and thousand shelled out and I'm still not an inch above my fears.

Currently on 80MG of prozac, and have been tapering off benzos for years."
Anxiety,Dr Big Park reporting,"Hi guys. Thanks for having me..I'm a medical practitioner, mycologist, microbiologist, and flora fawner who has had a lot of experience with various natural remedies for various mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, PTSD and the likes. Over my years of study and research I've come to realise that most of the drugs out in pharmacies and hospitals aren't meant to deal with the problem at the root but instead to curb your condition, keep it tame enough so you have to keep taking more and more of these drugs. They're not made to treat but to manage, all thanks to Big Pharma. I'm sure most of us on here have taken all sorts of medication from doctors, nurses, therapists, pharmacies and the likes and we don't get much of a solution. What we get instead is a fix that last for some days and we get back to old ways only by that time we're already hooked on the medication and then have to take more and more but to no avail. 

   But guys, there's a cure for mental health conditions. And it's all around us but we're not allowed to know. Everything we need for our survival and care is on this earth.. mother Earth is the best mother there is. It's high time we as the super-fauna of the earth embrace the healing qualities of the flora. I've been able to fix up people with issues like depression, PTSD and anxiety and give them a new hope through these natural remedies. Mind you, these remedies are quite unorthodox and you might be shocked to the bone when you hear about them, but when you look up information about these treatments you'd see that you're not so far from the truth. I'm just a road sign on this journey of life leading you in the right direction. There's nothing more I'd like to see than people getting over their depression and anxiety because I know how that feels, especially from a personal level."
Anxiety,"Struggling, need someone to talk to",
Anxiety,"What a hell is going on with me… Severe anxiety, brain fog, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, losing train of thought… etc, and fear of developing psychosis","Hey everyone, hope you are staying strong… I am new here, 22 years old, I would like to share my story, since I feel desperate about my recent change in mental health and would like to talk to someone who can relate to my experiences.

About two months ago, I experienced a very ‘bad trip’ on weed (panic attack, shaking, sweating, it seemed like I would die from a heart attack) and ever since it happened, I stopped my almost 3-year daily abuse. Now it has been two months since I quit weed and drinking, but these two months were dreadful in terms of my mental health… Prior to that, I never experimented with other drugs than psychedelics such as shrooms and acid, I did LSD a couple of times, and my last trip three months ago also shook me quite hard.. Although I felt okay after it, I think a week later, I started feeling first symptoms of anxiety which developed further as time passed by.

As I quit weed, at first, for around two weeks, I experienced withdrawal symptoms such as panic attacks and constant anxiety, night sweats, insomnia, throbbing headaches at the back of my head, vivid dreams, and slight hppd symptoms (sensitivity to light, floaters, mild trailing, flashes of color). As time passed, most of the physical symptoms subsided (except pulsating headaches in the same spot), I was left with persistent anxiety and started to develop other mental issues.

Two months in, after quitting weed and changing my lifestyle, I feel accompanied with rather constant DP/DR, insane brain fog, difficulties to concentrate, very bad memory (I struggle hard to remember what I  was doing the day before, or sometimes I can’t remember a simple conversation I was having 10 minutes ago, and it concerns me a lot), difficulties to think clearly, or express myself, sometimes I lose train of thought in my head, and have jumping thoughts, etc. Due to those sensations, I am in constant anxiety and fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia, and loosing everything I have reached so far.

While I manage to keep up with my daily responsibilites, and maintain social interactions, it has been difficult to so. I do not have any delusions, nor do I hear voices or see hallucinations, but the strange cognitive decline together with strong anxiety, fear of psychosis, and other sensations made me super sensitive to my surroundings, and sometimes make me check whether some of my senses are real. I had instances of hypochondria in early childhood, and I hope that this is the same case for me now, followed by something like PAWS from weed..

So that is how I feel today, and I am scared that this is the beginning of the end for me… For almost two months now I am clean off everything (except nicotine), and the only thing I am abusing are various supplements. I have scheduled my first appointment with a psychotherapist next week, hopefully that will help.

Did anyone go through anything similar? Please share, any help or suggestions would be appreciated!"
Anxiety,Knowing others have it worse than me,"Hey guys, ive been following this reddit for a while, and finally taken the courage to post my story and how i feel. 
Ive had panick attacks for 2 years now, im 20 and turning 21 in a week, and honestly, its not the fact that i have panic attacks often that kills me, its more so the fact that i feel like i need help, But at the same time i know that there’s a lot of people feeling worse than me, and i therefore push my problems Down. I experience panick attacks at night mostly which ruins my Day to Day life, i wont go to School or work when ive had a bad sleep, cus the fear of the anxiety and depression spiraling out of control is so huge. The feeling of impending doom is limiting me on that front as well. 
I am seeing a therapist ever week or 2 weeks, and ive been told that ive made progress, But the more my anxiety worsens just makes me feel like i have bigger set backs, than progress. I know my anxiety is not that bad as well, Because i Can honestly function normally in society for the most part, But when i have my bad episodes as well as depressive episodes, i just feel like i cant do it anymore. 
I Think my sleep issues come from a huge fire that we had in my House, which is probably Why to this Day still smell fire when im at my room, and sometimes have short flashback of this episode in my Day to Day life.
I havent been diagnosed at all, nor does my gp not want to prescribe me meds as of right now, since i Can function like a Human for the most part - even tho i experience massive dp/dr a few times a week, But something in me constantly tells me i need it, But again, the feeling of knowing im better off that others, is tearing me apart, since i hate pity and self pity. Also, it doesnt help that where i live the cost of a psychiatrist is ultra expensive, and the waiting time to get treatment for free through health Care is 2 years when its non urgent. 

Anyway, if u read through all of this, then Thank you. Just needed to vent a bit."
Anxiety,Waking up every morning in cold sweat,"For about as long as I can remember I’ve been waking up in the mornings pretty much 4/7 days a week in a constant cold sweat. I’ve never really pinpointed it’s cause but could definitely use some input.

I’ve been on antidepressants since I was 18, around 4 years ago and am currently taking 20mg Fluoxetine each day. However I have taken a wide variety of reuptake inhibitors before this. 

I’ve usually got a really awful sleeping pattern and find it super difficult to get to sleep (even when I’m feeling naturally tired), I am a daily weed smoker for around 2 years and ex benzo abuser. I’ve found in recent times my anxiety is essentially non existent with the combo of Fluoxetine and Passionflower Extract, but I still can’t seem to pinpoint the cause of the bad sleep. I’ve tried all of the normal things as well such as not drinking before bed, no screens 60 mins before sleep etc but to no avail. 

Anyone else have/had the same issue?"

Anxiety,is it invalid to take a day off from school because of anxiety,"i usually worry or stress over practically everything (it’s like my mind is never resting) but school definitely worsens my anxiety to the max. i’m a junior and i feel like i’m never able to relax. the minute i wake up i’m thinking what i have to do when i get to school and i make a mental list as i go on with my day about the assignments i have to get done, the classes i have to study for, how much time i should spend on each assignment, etc. by the time i get home i’m exhausted. i’ll tend to work on my assignments until 10-11 but sometimes this turns into 12-1 or more. even though this schedule seems bad it seems to work for someone like me who tends to work more effectively at night. but still i worry i’m not doing enough or i’m falling behind ( even if i’m not ). this morning i woke up perfectly fine and actually the opposite of sleep deprived. but as i started to get dressed and put on my makeup i started overanalyzing literally everything about myself. then i started thinking about how i didn’t like going to school and how i have all these assignments i have to do. and how i have all these quizzes to study for. it just kind of piled on me all at once and i felt an attack coming on (heavy breathing, sweating, not being able to think) and i realized i was going to be late for school if i didn’t leave soon. my attack lasted for about 8 mins and it left me with 6 mins to get to school on time so i decided not to go at all and just take the day to relax and reset. is this a childish thing to do like giving in to your anxiety almost??"
Anxiety,I think I failed my exam for the 6th time.,"So, I don’t know where to start. All my life I have passed my exams, heck I even speak 3 languages but, this time I think I may have to give up. I have tried to do my driving exam (theory one not practical) and fail every time, 3 times failed with 4 mistakes. I can’t continue to do this. I have even questioned whether I’m actually dumb or what’s the case, it’s my 6th time!!! I can’t pass it I have tried everything study by myself study in classes studied online read books. I think I’m gonna give up, what’s the point?? Any advice? What would you do? Has this happened to you or is it not normal?? Because All people I know have passed the exam the first time. is something wrong with me?"
Anxiety,Helpful App,"If you have issues focusing or relaxing or just taking a break from thinking for a while, there's this really helpful App I use called ""Amaru"". Even without paying for the full version you can get so much out of it. I personally haven't bought the full version because I get so much out of the free one.

The community is also amazing. Everyone uplifts each other. I honestly have a hard time being honest with my feelings but it feels so easy with them.

If your looking for something to help calm you down, relax, focus, or just take some time to play with the cute cat in the app, it's for you. I highly recommend it. I'm pretty sure it's available on most devices through the app store."
Anxiety,Muscle aches with Zoloft/Sertraline?,"Since taking them i am feeling very fatigue and tired, also my legs muscles are aching me loads, like i have been walking on my legs all day every day.

Anxiety,can't figure out,"I suck at explaining, It's been happening for a long time and i always just ignored it, Never tried to think about it or never tried to figure out what it was. As a guy, most of the time I tried to speak to someone about anxiety, my problems and all, it just gets ignored or taken too lightly, i don't know why, and i thought it could be a place to dump it all (not sure). 5 years back, i started feeling lonely and weird but I chose to ignore it. And then begins the sleeplessness, and explain it is soo dumb, it was like , i am too tired , want to sleep , trying to sleep ,my eyes are hurting but still can't sleep. It was like the brain was constantly thinking and thinking instead of being shut down. 
Few years later, the problem increased and i rarely felt happy. All i wanted is to wake up in a good mood , i started to keep myself busy and somehow that became my habit, just keep yourself busy so you don't think. 
I hate how my mind works, it's like frontend and backend of a brain, frontend is all the stuff I know and happening rn, backend is something my brain is thinking then even i Don't know, hence the reason of being sad/anxious for absolutely no reason. Like I'm having a great time and suddenly sadness out of nowhere.
Then i got used to it, used to feel neutral, no expressions no feelings for someone (not even my close ones), not wanting any partner. 

I thought getting out of college and getting a job would fix this , i got a great job and started living by myself but the problem is still there. I live alone now , no family, no friends yet. So it got a little worse. 
I haven't cried in years , i don't even remember last time i cried, and now i feel like crying all the time and i try to but still nothing happens, all i feel is a heavy throat. I don't know if someone would read this but if you did , thankyou."

I had a mini meltdown when I saw the email bc I hate being in trouble/seen as disinterested, having an anxiety spike over it."
Anxiety,Soes anyone else experience this?,"Throughout the day I will have random spikes of severe anxiety and its typically over something very small, or worse I dont even know why, it just happens. 

This has been happening for the past week or so and I genuinely have no idea why, but it is a terrible feeling."
Anxiety,everyone around me is too normal,"I don’t know why but I just can’t be like normal people. Because to be honest, I believe that there is no such thing as normal because we’re all different but I can’t help feeling that way. I feel like an outcast all the time and none of my interests are similar to any of my schoolmates. I can’t be outdoors too long or else I’ll have the worst panic attack while my classmates are having the time of their lives going out with each other. 

I don’t have any friends no matter how hard I try to socialize. I just feel so different but not in a way that it makes me unique or anything. I am so so quiet yet I sometimes hyperfixate on the most random things that people have to call me out for it. I’m just really not meant to be here. 

I am seeing my therapist in a couple days and I think I’m going to consult her regarding ADHD. I’m not self diagnosing but it would be nice to know what she thinks."
Anxiety,Fear of being seen/known? Need advice.,"I’ve always had anxiety ever since I was a kid but I think it manifested in high school. I used to be known for obsessing about a book series to the point where I couldn’t do anything if I didn’t associate it with that book. And one day I was talking to a classmate about a sequel book I was writing and she blindsided me when she told me it sounded stupid. It was the first time that I really realized that others could see me in a negative light. Another time at my church my pastor used me as an example in the lesson about how obsessive I was about this book series and we need to be like that for God.

I understand what he meant and it wasn’t intended as a bad thing but I still felt as if all eyes were on me. And I grew embarrassed by my obsession (hyper fixation? Idk) and I stopped enjoying the book because I felt like I was known for it. That my obsession was all people knew or saw about me.

This also manifests in shame about past mistakes where if someone knew me from childhood I want to avoid because I’m afraid of what they think. Or if I enjoy something then share about it, if someone else doesn’t like the thing then for some reason they don’t like me. I know it’s irrational.

The most recent case is that I went to a play with someone I knew and it was really good. I cried a lot during the show but this person kept side eyeing me and elbowed me because to them the emotion I was feeling didn’t match what was on stage. I told them that my personality doesn’t match hers but they couldn’t understand why I was so emotional during the show. I felt embarrassed. 

I went to the show the next night cause I wanted to enjoy the show without anyone judging me… but after the show some of the actors came to me in the lobby (community theater) and told me they saw me the past two nights and they loved my response to their performances. And they told me they all talked about me backstage. 

I know they meant it as a good thing… but I’m embarrassed. I was in a crowd of 200 people. Was I the only one emotionally invested? It doesn’t help that when I was trying to talk about it with the person I went with the first night and they implied that I was emotional for their attention. I admit it felt good at the time when the actors told me they enjoyed an emotional connection, but I never intended that! I never met these people before the show and I wasn’t seeking their approval. I was just enjoying the show…

I just feel embarrassed that people can interpret whatever they want from looking at me. And even when I’m with close friends I fear how they perceive me. I’d rather be isolated than be known and judged by other people’s perception cause I have no control over how others can interpret me.

The actors were so kind about my emotional response to the show. The main guy even has become mutuals with me on Instagram. Most of the main cast accepted my friend request on Facebook. But now they see my account. Now they can perceive whatever they want about me. And I have no reason to fear their perception but I do. And I wouldn’t have even thought about it if it wasn’t for the person I went with pointing me out that first night. Like Which is it? Am I an embarrassment to those around me or not? It’s so frustrating having two conflicting perceptions clashing like this.

I fear the perception of everyone. I enjoy cosplay because I can be someone else for a day and people expect a character and no one can know me. 

I have anxiety I know… but I think this goes beyond that. Maybe it’s a phobia or something. I don’t know but I can’t live like this. I’m tired of being scared and embarrassed of how others see me all the time. What can I do? Any advice would be appreciated."
Anxiety,Is there anything that’ll work without awful side effects ?,"Do all antidepressants, cause, insomnia, and for you to lose your mind at first, because it makes it nearly impossible on top of all the other side effects for me to make it through them but I always end up giving up and I feel so weak but like I also want to feel better, so how do people do this?
I feel like I’m backtracking. I’m waking up with a panic. It’s making me feel worse than I’ve ever felt no matter what I try. I started these because of physical symptoms, but I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. 
I just needed advice from people who’ve been through it because people to this no problem every day without a second thought, so why is it so hard for me?
Thanks for the advice !"
Anxiety,Waking up in the night,"For about two weeks now I’ve been struggling to keep myself asleep for any solid periods of time longer than 2 hours.

While I’m asleep I always wake up eyes fucking giant out of nowhere, and I feel like my heart’s gonna explode and I literally have to wheeze out a panic attack to the side before I can even think of trying to get back to sleep; and sometimes it takes me a while

Does anyone else have this problem? I’m medicated. If I need to clarify anything lmk."
Anxiety,struggling through burnout and breakdowns,"hi everyone. I (20F) have been suffering from GAD for as long as I can remember and feel like I'm at my breaking point. I've been in college for 3 years and am majoring in history education. I financially support myself, but just barely, through my part-time job. I feel like I have to do absolutely everything or else I won't succeed in life, but it's wearing me so incredibly thin. I have no time to even sleep and I'm driving myself crazy. I'm scared that my whole life I will be miserable I am now, working, student teaching, and going through the same cycle every day. I barely see my friends because when I'm not working or at school, I'm too anxious to make plans with them.

I feel like I don't know myself but I don't even have the time to figure out who I am. I'm going through an identity crisis and my GAD is certainly not helping. How am I expected to maintain this balancing act? i really do not know what to do anymore and any advice is appreciated."
Anxiety,Can’t pin it,"I feel like I’m constantly searching for the reason my anxiety flares up (everyday). Yesterday I had a series of difficult conversations, one with a friend, another with my child’s father, and one with the school counselor. I am a stay at home mom, struggling to figure out how to function in the world again, recovering from betrayal trauma, just had surgery, trying to manage to stay on top of life but it just seems to get on top of me time and time again.

I obsess about what it is that triggers my anxiety but in truth I feel it’s just everything. Today I wanted to get out of the house but the thought just gives me major anxiety. I’m struggling to do anything good for myself and if I rest or take a minute to breathe I just feel like a complete failure as I review my day like a bad movie. I’m on Zoloft and take lorazepam but I still feel like an insane person. I am getting exhausted from all the overthinking, tired of feeling this weight. I feel dependent on medication that doesn’t even seem to be helping..I guess I just need some words of encouragement or validation that I’m not crazy. I miss the person I thought I was. I don’t even recognize myself anymore."
Anxiety,Eye anxiety,i’m F17 and i’ve had this issue for a while. i was convinced i was going blind or loosing vision in my right eye a few months ago so i went to an optometrist and they did all the tests and looking you can possibly do and they said my eye is perfectly fine. i’ve started to worry maybe i have a blood clot in my brain causing pressure on my eye and maybe making everything seem like it’s fading out into the blackness. would that have been picked up? or am i crazy. they said my periferhal and everything was fine but i’m very worried because i always notice my vision isn’t as good as my other eye. i’m spiraling in panic and i don’t know what to do. i’ve also been getting headaches and weird pressury feeling in my eyes and ears and head line a migraine almost and i’m freaking out. please help me
Anxiety,Weed Induced Anxiety Disorder,"I need somebody's help who's experienced or saw someone close to you experience this. 
After smoking weed occasionally for over a year, one night at home had a terrible panic attack(my first encounter and the first time i acknowledged this) doctors prescribed me antidepressants. I denied the fact that i could have something called as anxiety so i refused to take the meds. Smoked again a few days later only to have a bad trip again. Took me nearly a week to get out of it(maybe anti depressents did work). The doctors diagnosed me with substance use disorder and said the anxiety was just the withdrawal. It didn't stop even after a month, still had that uncomfortable feeling which i never had before or maybe it was because i started messing my brain up that something was wrong with me. Started smoking pot again for few months, took a break, started having the same problems, consulted another doc, didn't complete his treatment And again smoked pot. This has been going on for a year now and i have neither completed any course of treatment from a single doctor nor have i stopped weed for more than a week. 

Now, according to some docs i have a genetic history of mental illness and smoking weed surfaced it. They say it Cannibis Induced Anxiety Disorder. 
I never felt a small tint of anxiety, not once before this. Is it my fault i spiralled down and subconsciously created this problem? Is it the weed addiction? Or is it the meds the docs prescribed which i never completed? Or is it really what the docs say a cannibis induced anxiety disorder?

If you've read all of this, please do help me out."
Anxiety,So tense... Hope this ends some day,"I just had to talk on the phone to the coordination woman from the home support service that I have... Nicest and most pleasant person ever, gonna give us exactly what we asked, but somehow it made me so extremely uncomfortable, like crawling out of my skin... so tense and even holding my breath, pacing and all....

I really hope this gets better. I've been doing everything to confront it (exposure) for the last couple of months but it's still extremely difficult..."
Anxiety,brown noise,"I suffer so badly with health anxiety/death anxiety. I suffer real bad with the physical symptoms of it, no medication can help me as I've tried. But one thing I can say that has helped me is Brown Noise on YouTube. I feel instantly relaxed, I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes of listening to it or feel sleepy. Just a tip if anyone would like to try it themselves. It helps me to focus, breathe and stay calm!"
Anxiety,Constant thoughts. ocd need help,"So im doing a challenge in a game and everytime I do something bad I have to load the game. the problem is I loaded even two times back instead of recent load but my mind says nop. you “probably” did something bad (I say probably because I dont even think i did something but my mind keeps telling me I did) now it wants me to start the game all over when I already spent some time on it. should I continue or start again? 

I put health tag because idk what to put."
Anxiety,"Fear about making a mistake, fear I will ""get in trouble""","I have this fear specifically around financial forms--it's hard for me to even START them (taxes, FAFSA, etc) becuase of my overwhelming fear that i will fuck it up. About 3 years ago, I had an issue with the IRS (not my fault, and SEEMED like not a big deal) that took 2 years to resolve and thousands of dollars. ANd I had this terrible fear BEFORE that, so now it's super compounded as my worst fears DID come true and it was awful.

How can i get over this? I generally just white-knuckle my way through, but it's awful."
Anxiety,When anxiety warps the meaning of other people's words,"I snapped at my parents today, something I never do because I deeply love &amp; respect them and have always been respectful of their wishes.   
My parents knew that I was going on a work trip out of town for the weekend. My Dad texted me to ask me for help with something 'when I have time' on Saturday, and I said I was out of town until Sunday evening. He texted me to ask if I was back yet on Sunday morning and I reminded him I was back Sunday evening. I called Monday to ask exactly what it was about and he said it was about and he said it was better if I just come over to their house. I was deeply tired, stressed, still running errands, but he asked ""Don't you have the day off after working all weekend?"" and I was taken aback -- whatever it was, he really must want me to help, I thought. 

""It's not important, it can wait until next weekend,"" he's said, but now I'm anxious and stressed. I weigh out if I should go to their house or rest, and my body clearly says it wants rest. But anxiety makes my brain weigh out ""How much do I love my family?"" and ""Isn't my fatigue less important than their well being?"" and of course, love for family \*ALWAYS\* outweighs my condition so I go. And it turns out they're not in any kind of emergency, they just want me to write a complaint for them (their English isn't that good) about their neighbour's drumming. And even that, they said, actually, never mind, don't do it yet, let's wait until the weekend. And my face just falls. i think they realize I am absolutely pissed off. What part about this was ""it's better to explain it to you when you come over""? Here, I thought it was complicated medical documents or something and it turns out to be a complaint they're not even sure they want to make. 

I got so stressed and anxious I couldn't even sleep that night. I am never disrespectful to my parents but yesterday I let my irritation show fully and I think it really upset them. 

But it's also my fault as my dad did say it's not urgent despite his repeated attempts to get me to come over. Anxiety makes me dig under the surface and interpret their messages as ""actuallly important and urgent"" when it's not. I was so defeated. And when my partner says it was ""peaceful"" without me, I interpreted this negatively and said I bet he wishes I was away for a lot longer, and he got upset at me for saying that. I dig into the negative meaning of people's words due to anxiety. Anyone else have this issue?"
Anxiety,Reminder.,"You can’t always get what you want, and that’s ok."
Anxiety,Experiencing Light Headedness,"This isn’t a new symptom for me, I’ve had it come and go in the past and have been able to pay it no mind usually.

However this came on four days ago and it’s been pretty bad, my anxiety is very high at the moment and the lightheaded ness almost takes me to panic. It’s very debilitating to the point I can’t leave the house now. I went to my van earlier and it looked as if it was swaying.

My hydration, eating and sleeping have been very poor due to this panic disorder relapse, I’ve stopped taking my propranolol because I know that can cause dizziness. Haven’t taken it for 2 days and my resting heart rate is still 56.

Just very scared I’m going to allow this lightheaded sensation consume me and it’ll be permanent"
Anxiety,Sometimes the meds just... don't work. Anyone else?,"Yesterday night I had an Atarax (25mg) to calm down before bed and while utterly zoning out from it on the bed I felt a slight leg-pain and immediately freaked out (bad, bad health anxiety) and I flew straight into a crying-my-eyes-out panic attack, and that happens a lot. It's like, the meds help my baseline anxiety (doesn't eliminate all the symptoms but certainly makes me not carea), but it does heck-all for an actual attack when they happen.

Does anyone else get this? Maybe Atarax just ain't doing it for me. I know it's on the ""low-tier"" end of these kinda meds, but it always felt like it's helped in the past."
Anxiety,Anxiety doubting your happiness,Why does this happen? You’re feeling more in calm and all of a sudden the anxiety goes “oh but are you really happy?”. It’s weird
Anxiety,I hate anxiety,so my moms best friends son needed a specialist that could prescribe him anxiety meds and do check ups and all that. well my brother used to go to a doctor like that so my mom told her to take him to the same guy. she was telling me the whole story and how she was so happy she could help them find a doctor. yet i’m over here struggling more than I ever have. I’ve given up on even trying to tell her how I feel but she knows how bad my anxiety is. she won’t let me take meds because of ONE bad experience on a. she’s always preaching how she wishes she could help me yet does nothing to actually help me. she won’t help me find a good therapist she won’t let me go to the doctor or go on meds. yet she’ll help someone else’s kid. my anxiety is so bad my life is being ruined and she couldn’t care less. It’s so exhausting telling someone how you feel and they just dont care. she always either changes the subject when I explain my anxiety or she tells me to just not think like that. I get it she’s going through things too but as my mother who claims she cares so much you’d think she’d try and help me a little more. I even feel selfish for saying that. I know i’m not the only thing that matters but while everyone else is getting help i’m still in the same boat and honestly it’s drowning.
Anxiety,Anxiety or Intuition?,"I really need advice because I don't know, I and truly believe I could be overthinking this. 

I got a job and its been a few months now. We work remotely, and I do love my job. Before, everything seemed fine, more than great. 

This is what I noticed: 
Since we utilize Teams Instant messaging, we react to eachothers messsages and response. My coworkers &amp; boss would always react to my messages and respond back to me quickly. Lately I noticed that no one even acknowledges my messages (no response, no reaction.) but they seem to do it whenever other members or the boss in group has something to say. I feel like something has changed in the group dynamic. And I brought up the fact that I don't feel connected to my coworkers to my boss and she each in their own  spoke to them they both said everything was good. 

I am still new so theres questions that I have, and because I dont feel like bothering my coworkers I dont ask them anymore. 

Also, there was an example last week where I messaged my coworker &amp; hes always the first to like my boss messages, and i noticed he didn't even respond back to me and he messaged me regarding something else not answering my question. 

For reference, I got fired at my old job because my boss and coworkers didn't like my personality. 

Am I overthinking it or are they showing me that I am not liked? I have been crying and feeling extremely upset about work. Do I need to seek therapy?"
Anxiety,Why do all anxiety “cures” contain things that give me anxiety?,"My anxieties have gotten rather hard to cope with recently. Yet all the things I’m told to do, or try to make things better, are so full of things that cause me deep anxieties. For example, going out and socialising, exercising, trying new things? The cycle is never ending, how do you beat something when you don’t have the energy or will power to even try?

It’s like I’m living in self-destruct mode, I don’t want to do things because I’m anxious, yet to get over my anxieties I have to do things? 

It sounds so easy but it feels so impossible to me right now, I’ve pushed everyone away because they keep attempting to get me out. The truth is I don’t want to get out, I want to stay in, and feel safe, and out of peoples way…

I feel broken beyond repair, but I also don’t want to repair myself. I don’t know if I am explaining it right, but surely it’s more common of a feeling than I expect?

So my question is… Can you get over anxiety without having to feel anxious in the process (or at least lesser amounts of anxiety)?"
Anxiety,internal buzzing/vibrating?,"I've been super stressed with health anxiety. I've been having these buzzing/vibrating/internal tremors in my lower left abdomen/pelvic area.

They come and go in waves. It feels like a cellphone is buzzing inside me. It lasts like 2-3 seconds and go happen every few seconds for a few minutes or even up to an hour. There can also be times where i don't feel it at all. 

Had some blood work done, did and endoscopy and colonoscopy and was diagnosed with gastritis mild. This all started when i was stressing over biopsy results and now i cant shake it. Been almost a week now."
Anxiety,I feel like I'm being constantly watched by my parents.,"TL;DR
I work in a family business, so my parents and me are all at the same place at work. Today went to a cafe right opposite to our workplace, to have some pancakes. While i waiting for my food, i got a call from my mom, she asked me where I am, i told her I'm at the cafe, she said she can see me, and she's asking why am I simply sitting there with my phone, and she said that if dad sees me he will get angry. I felt so uncomfortable, I'm 24 years old and my parents have a problem with me taking a break. 

This made me realise how bad it is, it's not the first time something like this has happened, several times before this my parents have asked me why am i always on the phone. There are cameras at the workplace, sometimes they sit and watch. This one time i was at work. And my dad sent me a screenshot of me sitting on my phone and he questioned me. I use my phone only when I have nothing to do. When I have work, i do it. 
No matter where I am, i always feel like they'll be watching me somehow, when i go out with friends i worry about my parents passing by, when I'm in my room at night, even tho they're asleep, i keep getting worried about them barging in. 
My life is already miserable because of them, i have other anxiety issues because of them, and now this. It really feels like a prison with no way out."
Anxiety,How do I cope with anxiety of parents aging,"Hi. I am 21 years old. I struggle with general anxiety as well as health anxiety. My health anxiety extends to my parents health too. Even if I notice any little change on them I start freaking out (I sometimes freak them out too because I look visiby stressed out :( )
For example,  I saw my mom's eye was a bit red and started obsessing and stressing out about that. How do I cope :( 
Is there anybody struggling with the same? Please share some tips"
Anxiety,I think I have a problem with disappointing others.,"For reference, I had a great childhood, but often times I did feel like my parents were hard on me. I didn’t feel like they fully understood the fact that I had anxiety, and I was neurodivergent. My parents are in their 50s, so mental health, anxiety etc was not talked about as we know. 

Anyway, I am a business owner, and I have began obsessing about messing up. I don’t sleep well because I’m afraid I won’t wake up in time, I worry I’m going to make people upset with choices I make. I worry I’m going to bother my neighbors with my noise (I play music and sound proofed my suite but I’m still scared I’ll get in trouble.) I over analyze, I obsess and can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve never made a mistake like this before, so the idea that it’ll happen just makes me spiral. 

Do I need therapy? Why am I like this? Is it because I care and want to people please?"
Anxiety,medication for anxiety,I (F20) just recently had an intake for therapy and during the intake I was told that my anxiety seems severe enough for medication. I’ve battled anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Im nervous about starting medication and how it could make me feel. Has anyone been put on medication for anxiety? How did it make you feel? Did you have any negative side effects?
Anxiety,physical symptoms?,im 21 and been struggling with GAD for most of my life. it flared up terrible in the past year or so and im the worst ive ever been. im working on myself but the damn physical symptoms of anxiety are hard to shift. i struggle with stomach issues and i have awful emetephobia which isnt a great combination. the anxiety nausea/stomach pains/diarrhoea are the bain of my life. any tips to get over it?
Anxiety,"DAE ""hear"" silence?","I live in a fairly populous area with a road nearby and lots of people running around. This morning, I was awake in my living room at around 4:30. There was NO noise whatsoever. Everything was painfully quiet.

As I focused on the silence, I began to notice kind of a dull roar in my ears. It was gradual, and kind of freaky. As soon as I moved and made a noise, it stopped. 

Cue panic attack. 

For what it's worth, I'm 98% certain it's not tinnitus. I take excellent care of my ears (I'm religious about ear plugs at shows). Google says nearly 70% of peole experience ""phantom sounds"" when placed in a room without any audio stimulus. If that's the case, I'm not *as* worried. My wife said she kinda gets the same thing when it's unusually quiet, but I'm still a bit freaked. Anyone dealt with this?"
Anxiety,Feeling like a failure,I’m feeling so defeated. I just don’t even know where to start. I keep getting jobs and quitting them because they are too much for me emotionally and I get panic attacks. I finally got a work from home job but even that has me sobbing at lunch and I’ve barely had it but I already feel like i can’t do it. i feel like i’m letting down my husband constantly by not contributing. i feel embarrassed and ashamed to quit again but i’m at a loss of what to do. i feel like a loser to his family and even mine because i’m so incapable of handling stress that i cant even do a work from home job. i thought this time things would be different but it’s looking like the same result. i’m so mad at myself for being in this position. we have to pay off student loans for a degree i’m not even using. it’s a useless degree too. it was a “fun” degree and isn’t getting me anywhere. if we lived in a big city it could get me somewhere but we don’t live somewhere that it’s applicable. i feel like i have no skills or talents that i can use. i wasted college. i have no creative skills to even try etsy with. i wanna do furniture flipping but i cant because i’m small and cant move furniture myself. i’m just feeling like a complete waste of space because i cant contribute anything right now. i just had a miscarriage last week and i really thought being pregnant was going to lead me to my true want of being a stay at home mom. i’ve always dreamed of being a stay at home mom. now i lost that too. im just at a loss. i’ve read every article on “jobs to have with anxiety” and all of those and none of them help. i don’t want to take medication but even if i did it wouldn’t change the situation i’m in because i don’t think it’d help enough. i just don’t know what to do anymore.
Anxiety,Back in university,"I just spend a year away from university. It was amazing and I even stopped taking anti-anxiety meds. I still had stressors in my life but I could handle them and it was fine.

I have been back in uni for a month. Right now I am trying to follow a class I am genuinely interested in but I keep twitching and feel the need to scream. I am also sick so that isn't helping. I feel so much anxiety and everything takes up so much effort.

During my year abroad I got the chance to sport and be social and in the beginning I was able to keep up with it. Now I spend most of my day sitting down (studying, following class) and it is becoming depressing. I still sport but it just isn't what I need. I don't have the energy to stay after class and hang out with people. I hate it. I don't want to be here. I wish I hadn't come back to university and just continued my job. 

Just had to get this off my chest."
Anxiety,Finally able to do things other people do,"As of this year I've finally been able to fly on a plane alone, which I thought I'd never do. I finally used my card to check out at a register by myself. And lastly, I've been able to kind of hold a conversation with strangers in real life and video games. 

All of those things have brought me immense anxiety at one point, but I'm glad I was able to do it! Everything is scary but I'll do it all eventually, one thing at a time :)"

Anxiety,How do you bring yourself down from a panic attack?,I had a multi hour long PTSD induced panic attack yesterday. I seriously could not bring myself down from it at all. I’m starting Zoloft tomorrow but need some advice. I was counting and trying to take deep breaths but it wasn’t working.
Anxiety,Would adhd medication help my anxiety?,I have adhd and I used to take medication for it years ago and it seemed to help level me out then. Would it help now?
Anxiety,how do i stop thinking that all of my friends hate me,"one of my biggest GAD triggers for years has been about how people perceive me. but it’s gotten about 1000000 times worse since a traumatic friend breakup last year (super long story but basically was cut off out of nowhere by my two best friends that i was living with for being, in the words “annoying, too negative” etc. while going through the hardest time of my life). after that happened, i lost all of my other closest friends. 

fast forward to a year later- i met my amazing boyfriend a year ago and am now a first year law student. 

i’ve since made peace with those friendship breakups. but the thing that’s stuck around is that im CONSTANTLY anxious that all of my friends hate me. i’m reading into every single social interaction, constantly worrying/trying to figure out if people hanging out with me or talking badly about me, and am so anxious that they’re closer to each other than they are to me and can’t wait to cut me off. i’ve also been forcing myself to talk a lot less than i normally do to appear “less annoying,” and been overthinking every word i say to my friends 

my anxiety about this has ruined so many days for me. i’m always on edge and high strung on the inside, no matter how much i hide it. it also doesn’t help that law school is a super stressful environment already.

has anyone dealt with anything similar/have any advice? i’m usually about to use logic to reason out my feelings, but i’ve gotten so good at gaslighting myself that i’m a burden and am hated by everyone. 

TLDR: had really traumatic friendship breakup last year and now am constantly anxious that my new/existing friends will
do the same to me."
Anxiety,I'm struggling to do anything work related any help appreciated,"Hey guys I'm struggling for quite a while now at work.

I've started to work as an IT Trainee for about 10 months now and I'm extremely demotivated to work at all. I have exactly one task that has a very strict deadline which I have to finish twice a week. This one I will do on time albeit just procrastinating to the last second.

I have two other tasks to do, one has no active deadline that I know of and the other ones deadline keeps getting pushed forward. I feel so lost looking at these tasks and am afraid to ask for help especially because I should've done them a few months ago and I am scared of the confrontation.

Additionally we have a rule that lets us have 2 days WFH and 3 office days per week. I haven't been in the office for 3 months and somehow it seems either no one cared or noticed. My gf pressed me to go to the office (which is a good thing, I need to challenge myself) one day and even drove me there, but even the day before I was unable to think clearly, constantly thinking about being confronted by my Trainee mentor on why I don't show up and don't finish my tasks. The day she drove me, I had an anxiety attack on the way there. She turned around and it was another WFH day since I was unable to work in that condition.

Even during WFH I honestly work maybe 20% of the time. I often just stare at th screen and just think about where I wanna be. A beautiful garden or a nice sunset, or just laying in bed all cozy and just play some games. A lot of the time I am just so tired despite sleeping a full 8 hours, but as soon as I log off work I seem to have a burst of energy and can easily stay up even till late in the night.

I smoke weed currently (started again because it soothed my anxiety and depression) but I'm trying to stop because I've read it can make anxiety attacks worse, kinda like a YoYo where you bounce back way harder when being sober. However the anxiety just gets stronger during quitting and I'm unable to find a way to be functional while quitting.

My psychiatrist prescribed me 75 mg of Effexor which I should take for two weeks and then up the dosage to 150mg. I tried 75mg one day last Sunday and I felt really weird. Like being drunk and on some stimulant at the same time. I've constantly had the need to move around, smiling a lot and actually wanted to party. If there weren't the feeling of having to vomit and vertigo I would've probably gone partying lol. However, this does not seem like something that I would be able to work on. Do I need to call in sick until I have accustomed to my meds?

Because of the side effects and the extremely long time a lot of people need to come off Effexor plus my history of substance abuse, I'd like to try a different approach without medication and just trying to pull through.

Do you guys have any idea how to motivate myself for work and how to fight my anxiety regarding going into office?

Any help appreciated. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read it, I appreciate you."

Anxiety,Getting over losing a friend who treated me terribly for half a year,"I don’t have many friends. Two really close ones and a few less close ones. I argued with one of them two days ago because of how she’s treated me for over half a year (bullying, telling me to shut up when I speak, making fun of what I told her about my depression/suicidal thoughts, etc.) and I feel bad for it because I started the argument. I feel like a complete pushover because I can’t stand up to anyone who does something to me. I put up with everything she did to me for half a year and it took a toll on my mental health every single time. I’ve apologised to her every time I’ve done something wrong (usually over something insignificant she got upset over) but she’s never said sorry once for everything she’s done to me. I don’t know what to do. I know I don’t want to be her friend again but it hurts thinking about how much of a dick I was when I could finally let loose on her. Some context here about what happened, essentially I got uninvited from her party 2 months after I was told I could go and half a week before the party was taking place. I immediately thought it was because because of her and knowing her it was a reasonable accusation to make but she claims it wasn’t her choice and honestly I believe her. But I didn’t apologise and let it go, I was upset with her so I started arguing against her until it eventually stopped on both sides. I went to a chat I’m in with her best friend and she argued with me trying to defend her but I brought up everything she did to me and she agreed with every point I made. I feel like a dick because her friend went to my best friend after and asked why I layed into her about it all so hard. I don’t think I did anything wrong here I just think I handled defending myself a little poorly because her friend didn’t deserve the onslaught she got when she was just trying to defend her. But at the end of the day she’s been terrible to me for over half a year and the only thing keeping me in contact with her was that party and without that I had no reason to stay her friend. To give an example of something she did to me she made a joke about me jumping into the road while I was just walking (I’m suicidal so it was a fucked joke to make and she knew that). I stand by my decisions I made that night but honestly I just feel like shit for ending one of my few friendships and attacking her best friend the way I did. So yeah, the advice I’m looking for here is just how to accept and move on from losing a friend and how to explain myself in a calm and rational manor in the future, wether any anger be pent up or not."

Anxiety,"I’ve had 2 borderline panic attacks today, and I’m anxious to the point of my chest hurting. But I feel tired and zoned out so I’m drinking a bang. Let’s see how this goes.","I am prescribed adhd meds, I try to replace them with caffine because my psychiatrist wants me to schedule an appointment with my primary care physician so she can fill the scrips for my controlled substance medications through my PCP. I’m too nervous to go to my doctor, I haven’t seen her in a year and I’m scared she’ll think I’m “looking for drugs” because I’m prescribed 2 benzos and a stimulant. So I’ve been rationing and replacing where I can. 

Today has been rough, I had a panic attack on the way to chemistry and had to stop walking and just sit down and try to wait it out. I was then late and never got to finish my quiz. My grade isn’t that good in chemistry and I fell down a rabbit hole of how bad this is going to effect me. At this point my chest starts hurting and I’m shaking through most of the class. 

Class just ended, I’m still really anxious, but I feel zoned out. I need to focus for my next class as we are reviewing for an exam. I bought a bang and have started drinking it, I know it’s going to give me more anxiety but I’d take that over feeling like I can’t pay attention and maybe I can push through it to pay attention in class somewhat. 

I wish I wasn’t like this. I wish I didn’t have to take so many medications. I wish I wasn’t so anxious to see a doctor that I went with Telepsychiatry and now I need to see my other doctor to have my scripts filled. I wish I could just focus in class, all the others make it seem so easy. But, that’s enough wishes, there’s so many more things I would want to do if I just wasn’t scared by even the most basic of things like saying hi to people or starting a conversation. I mean like fuck, I’ve gone through 3 years of college without making more than 1 friend (girlfriend, I have one somehow)."

Anxiety,Anxiety solutions ?,"Hi all,

I have been working with myself though therapy of different sorts since I was around 23 and I am now 28. 5 years. I mainly suffer from social Anxiety and performance anxiety (when I have to performe in front of others, examns, on stage, speaking etc.). 

Nothing has really ever truly helped me unfortunalty. 

Last winter I spoke to my doctor and we decided medicine could be something to try. I tried Venlafaxine which did work for my anxiety, but also gave me serious hair loss. So i stopped. Then I tried Setraline which gave me seriouse sexual side effects. So I stopped it recently. I was off it for 2 months and started to feel my anxiety come back. I just started Trintellix last week, but I am pretty certain I already feel the same sexual side effects as with Setraline. So I might have to stop it. 

I am looking for any natural remedies that can just work at a fraction of the medicine. Did anyone tried cannabis oil/CBD/CBG oil ? Or microdosing or anything that might work ?? 

Please let me know, as I am growing tired of my issues. I feel it is night and day when quitting the medicine. I fall back intro the same overly sensitive alert nervoussystem.

Thank you for any reply"

My anxiety makes me question my feelings and all I can do is think about how this won’t work out, because I assume it won’t. Anyone else struggle with this? I know that I am in a healthy relationship and I should keep pushing through because if I run, I may be running from something truly incredible. But the anxiety is so overpowering and scary. I feel so stuck. If I leave him, my anxiety will be gone, but I could be missing out on something amazing. But if I stay, I have to wake up everyday with this anxious feeling and it’s exhausting. Mostly just venting but if anyone has any advice, I’d love it. I love you all and we will get through this."

Anxiety,Can't sleep if I'm seeing my crush next day,"Hi!

A little intro: Met a girl 4 months ago on a trip and now we are dating. We see each other only once a week or two weeks (it's been 17 days since last time), we have a lot of feelings, we show them nicely and we're happy with what's happening. We already went on another trip and we have a few more planned. It can be said that we are something

The problem is..

The night before I see her, I can't sleep. I can't get to sleep even 3 hours and stay up all night. I'm fully tired all day and, although we allways had a good time, I don't feel fully active, I'm not 100% me, because I'm very tired and that makes me feel very frustrated. This happens if we already scheduled to see each other, and also when I feel like inviting her next day by surprise.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: The FIRST time I saw her after the trip where we met, I went to bed late and slept little, I was tired. She slept at my house. We had a good day but I didn't enjoy it at it finest because of my tiredness. Also we tried to have sex, but we couldn't do the full thing because of the same thing. Since that day, I feel the need to be awake when I see her, because I don't really enjoy being tired. Ironically, worrying about sleeping makes me unable to fall asleep.

My current strategy is to ask her out only when I have been able to sleep well (I did this a few times and went perfect) but there are certain dates that we agreed to see each other (for example on Sundays or the 29th of each month) or, for some reason, I want to invite her on a particular day because there is a special show and that makes me councious of the day so I'm unable to sleep.

Want to clarify I have a 'good' life. I work, play sports, eat well, see friends frequently, but this drives me crazy as I'm not being able to handle it. Also want to clarify I'm not used to have insomnia.

I tried meditation, working out, stretching, listening to music, counting sheeps and many other tricks I found online, but nothing. Even yesterday I worked out at 1AM and felt completely exhausted before bed. But no matter how tired my body is, my mind is still active. I don't have any specific thoughts (I don't feel anxious), but notice my mind is running and that doesn't happen on normal nights.

ANOTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Although we allways had a good time going out, we couldn't have one single 'sexual' night AT IT FINEST, because of this. I'm not insecure about my talents on that area, but maybe there's a little extra pressure on wanting to be awake because of that 'pending' task. I think the whole problem here is the pressure I put myself on wanting to sleep well and I need to slow down brain activity.

I'm desperate for any recommendations. Thank you in advance!

TL,DR: I suffer from insomnia only nights before I see my SO"

Anxiety,Anxiety or paranoia?,"Ok, so my anxiety got so bad that today I had to turn away an AirBnB guest and I have no idea if this is not already paranoia. My anxiety makes my hyperaware to the point that it is not healthy anymore.

I had someone request a late check in for himself and his three friends. He said that a host has last minute cancelled on them so I felt sorry and said ok, you guys can come after 10 pm. The guy who booked then said that his phone is about to die and that one of his friends will text me when they will arrive so a few minutes later I receives a message from this friend ""I will arrive around 11 pm"". I was suspicious that he said ""I"" and not we. But I thought all is going to be ok. Then I kind of had the feeling that it is not going to be a group which will arrive but only one guy and my gut feeling was right. When this guy appeared, the friend from the guest who booked I was texting with, he was all on his own and without the guy who booked and without the friends. He said he dropped off the guest who booked and the other friends in town because they wanted to get food and they did not want to keep me up so late so he already went to the house first. 

I did not let him inside because the guy who booked and with whom I first texted with on AirBnB did not appear and only the friend I texted after with via SMS appeared claiming the other ones were getting food. 

Guys, I felt anxious as hell, almost like I had some sort of PTSD and I have no idea if this was my anxiety or if I am starting to become paranoid???? I am a woman living on my own and I was SOO afraid. The guy then left. 

I am not sure if this was all a misunderstanding or if my anxiety kicked in because this was valid?? I am such an anxious person and it destroys my life."

Anxiety,Has anyone here completely “eliminated” their anxiety ?,"Hi everyone, first time poster for anxiety. Hope this is appropriate for this thread. 

I’ve had anxiety my whole life. Definitely stems from my family from a young age (at least early teens). I’ve had some terrible “absolute rock bottom” feeling completely out of control moments with panic attacks I couldn’t manage in my 20s. Now in my early 30s, I feel I’ve had a big improvement since then. Been maybe 3 years now that I feel I am actually “in control” and can get through panic attacks (they’re not often anymore) and think logically telling myself that it’s temporary and it’ll pass. And it does!

I’ve accepted that I’ll probably have to live with my anxiety and just have to get through certain moments. I can identify (mostly on my own) when I’m being irrational and reacting purely emotionally, but this also means that I let myself feel my emotions so I’m more in tune with what is triggered by anxiety and not. I definitely still have those “anxiety”’moments and I do my best to handle it and try my best not to let it affect my partner. 

I can give a little example of when my anxiety surfaces. I was prepping for a 3 week trip and 2 days before, my 10 yr old cat was showing symptoms of feeling unwell and although I was able to eventually make a final decision of how I should handle it, my anxiety caused me to have shakey hands and hyperventilate a little, and I was panicking to find a vet asap. It was very difficult to think clearly in that moment, but I was not hysterical. Essentially, I was thinking about the worst, that I’d have to bring her in for emergency surgery and then leave her to be taken care of by my cat sitter and it broke my heart to think about leaving her like that. Eventually, I determined that the situation wasn’t an “immediate emergency”, and everything turned out fine (got a vet the next day and she got meds). 

Like I said, I’ve accepted that I will probably live with this anxiety and I feel it is at its minimum now, but still present. As long as it doesn’t get worse, I’m fine with this. But my partner seems to think that I can get over it completely. As in, I can be in full control of my emotions and catch my anxiety before I even start to feel it. I’m wondering if this is possible? My progress is thanks to self help and constantly trying to be self aware. I’ve had zero therapy and I’ve always been under the impression that therapy helps you cope, not eliminate anxiety. Am I wrong? Is there anyone who has successfully completely gotten over their anxiety?

Please keep in mind, I’m not talking about PTSD. I wouldn’t say I have PTSD. My childhood is in no way “traumatic”, but my home situation was definitely difficult, living with paranoid religious Protestant parents, with little freedom until I was around 21 yrs old. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells living with my family. 

Thanks so much in advance for your advice!"

Anxiety,Anxiety attack lasting days,"Hello,

I feel like I've hit rock bottom this time. I've been having panic attacks for years, but last year, after months in therapy and support from family and friends I had gotten a lot better. I managed to go one year without taking Xanax, and life was (mostly) good.


In the past few months, however, life's gone to shit. I've started getting panic attacks again, and more and more frequently. Two days ago, my boyfriend had to go away for work, and that evening I got one of my worst panic attack ever. It lasted 6 hours, and I used all the tools I've learned during all these years but nothing helped. I was just stuck there, suffering alone in my own home. I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion. Since that day, my anxiety has **not** lowered at all. I don't get any break, I'm on the brink of a panic attack all day long. And the evenings are the worst; I just want to go to sleep, but the second I lay down in my bed the panic arrives. I wake up multiple times during the night, and I feel the only thing that'd help me would be rest, but I can't manage to rest correctly.
I've been barely eating and drinking, and I can't go twenty minutes without crying.


I know I'm not the only one who's gone through something like this. It's horrible, but I know I'm going to get better. Do yall have any tips on how to get better, even if it's baby steps?

Thank you for your help"
Anxiety,"My boyfriend can't handle my anxiety, should we break up?"," I (21F) have been together with my boyfriend (22M) for about 9 months. I have really bad anxiety, which I take medication for. Honestly it is usually quite manageable, with the right environment and the right support. Sometimes, however, I go into a depressive/anxious episode/period where it is less manageable. When these happen, my boyfriend has a tendency of freaking out and distancing himself, which in turn just feeds my anxiety because it makes me feel like an unlovable freak. This causes the entire thing to turn into a me vs him thing instead of us vs my anxiety. When he's scared of my anxiety he says some pretty hurtful things, things that just make me feel like I'm nothing. He says he doesn't feel like he should have to handle my anxiety and that I just have endless needs. We are a long distance couple which makes this 10x harder. He went back home a week ago, which made things stressful which in turn triggered my anxiety as we hadn't learned to get used to being online again yet. So this whole thing turned into a big argument where I was basically just left to pick myself up on my own as he needed to distance himself to recover. I understand this is really stressful for him, but I cannot handle feeling like a freak in his eyes. I know he loves me so much, and I really love him but I just don't know what to do"

Anxiety,I think I'm emotionally dependent on my friends and I need advice (Long),"I apologize in advance if this gets kinda dramatic, I'm not trying to be, I promise, this is mostly a stream of consciousness explanation. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  
I spend a lot of time with my friends, like, we hang out online in a voice chat and play games pretty much every night, and have been doing so for a while now. 

If they can't make it on one night or have to get off early, I get extremely anxious, even a little bit angry sometimes. It's not that I don't understand that they have their own lives, I totally get that, and the last thing I want is to get so anxious or upset that I demand that they hang out, because I know I wouldn't like it if someone did that to me.

They have lives too, and I understand that, so I need to figure out how to be okay when they can't hang out, and eventually when we all have families or other obligations that put a stop to our nightly hangouts. It's weird because I wasn't like this until recently. 

Late last year, I lost a fairly long standing group of friends for various reasons, and begun hanging out with this ""new"" group, comprised of mostly people I had known well in the past, and was already fairly close to. The loss of the old friend group messed me up pretty bad, but for a while I felt great with the current group, better than I had in a long time with the old group.

Before we started pretty regularly hanging out online every night, I was pretty much fine with being alone or just doing things by myself. I don't know exactly when it changed, but one night when one of them said they couldn't get on the next day I noticed that it filled me with deep sense of dread. It felt like abandonment, I guess, even though I knew that wasn't what was happening. 

A particularly bad trigger is when one of the friends who would always stay up late and hang out until the wee hours of the morning started having to go to bed at a more reasonable time, and hasn't stayed on or hung out late at all since, even on weekends. It's perfectly reasonable to not want to be awake at night until 2 or 3AM, but it still feels almost like I'm being abandoned. Even though they still hang out with me regularly, the sudden change feels like they're just trying to cut down how often they hang out with me. When we had days off, we would both hang out online during the day, and then again that night with the whole group, now that's a thing of the past entirely. I feel like my best friends are starting to hate me, and I don't know how to stop the spiral of negative thoughts. They just keep going until I fall asleep or distract myself from it with something else, but it always comes back when I stop either of those things.

I spent almost my entire life thus far being a people pleaser to avoid being abandoned by loved ones, because I spent a lot of time as a kid around relatives who made me feel that I would be if I ever made a mistake or remotely upset someone. I'm even in therapy right now trying to work through it all, but I don't get to have sessions with my therapist nearly as often as I would like to, and the time between sessions feels like forever. 

I know that this is a lot, and I know it's pretty strange to have a group of friends that hangs out this often, but any advice or ideas on how to stop being so dependent on them would be appreciated. I can't live my life like this, I need to learn to be okay by myself, but all the advice on the internet is just ""do things alone,"" ""treat yourself,"" ""learn to love yourself,"" yeah but HOW? I don't know how to do any of those things without feeling weird or even how to do some of them in the first place.  


TL;DR: I depend on my friends being regularly available for my emotional well being, I want to stop this.  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,Does focused art therapy help solving for anxiety?,"A friend of mine recently mentioned how her therapist would ask her to paint or sketch her feelings or identified causes of anxiety. It went somewhat like this - give it a form, give it a colour, etc.
Does anyone over here know how it works out and what are the outcomes of one such exercise?"
Anxiety,"I'm worried about the anesthesia not numbing my tooth again. I've been poked prodded, prodded and traumatized twice, and the tooth is still there. I need comfort, and some advice","Hello! To provide some context, I had gone back to the dentist twice to have a decayed tooth (third molar) pulled out without much success, mostly because the anesthetic didn't numb me enough and I could feel every tug at my tooth. Now, if the pain had been bearable I simply would've sat through it, but I have a history of dental trauma and the pain...is so real.  
Now, I have a pretty compassionate dentist. My last tooth extraction was a wisdom tooth (the one next to my third molar) and it took me four visits to finally it pulled, and it hurt everytime. I feel like a fool on the dental chair - I'm sure my dentist hates me at this point. I really try to sit through the pain, but the pain is enough to send me spiraling and having a panic attack. I've cried during 8/10 of my dental visits and I'm embarrassed. I'm 21.  
To make things worse, I'm worried about the safety of this. Now, I had finished a course of antibiotics before my last visit. It's just...I'm scared to go back now because it might fail again. Honestly, on my third visit I'm thinking of just sitting through the pain and telling my dentist to keep tugging through the tears. I like my dentist - she's my mom's best friend and she's never been annoyed at me or anything. I just can't help but feel violated, even if she didn't do it on purpose.  
What can I do to distract myself from the pain next time? I'm so scared to go back. Dental visits used to be really chill back then."
Anxiety,"Anxiety is gone, but somehow i still feel there are minor symptoms","5 months ago my anxiety was worse due to binge drinking, i stopped drinking and smoking but switched to vaping instead. Somehow, some days in a week when night is coming or sometimes in the afternoon, i can't think straight, this happens everyday but sometimes not. Is it still an effect of anxiety? I was rushed to the ER because my hands twisted and my body and face went numb, other doctors thought it was a seizure but i was fully awake at that time and my body went cold and can feel it rising to my head during that time. I always get the sense of dread and fear every afternoon exactly 5PM onwards for some minutes or hours. I've practiced calming my anxiety naturally and stopped the meds and did work but there are intrusive thoughts and all i do in a day is sit in the computer because of online classes. Is it something else related to anxiety? My thinking speed was always fast but somehow it has reduced ever since i healed from anxiety. Im always a curious person when i drink but ever since i stopped drinking those curious thoughts became intrusive thoughts which went natural now in my lifestyle. I try not to think about much whenever i get simple symptoms such as back fatigue and other stuff but when those stuff are gone, thoughts of fear and dread come in and i always have in my mind ""Im gonna hyperventilate and hope it does not occur like last 5 months ago'' What are the chances of hyperventilating again? I try to get some exercise but i get shy because my exercising spot which is in my terrace is in front of alot of neighbor's house which they can see me which i get shy with. Anyways what were some symptoms that commonly show up after anxiety went away, im always thinking that i have depression and need to overcome this again. Thanks for those who comments!"

My period is late and I’m scared I’m pregnant by some weird  thing that’ll make you get pregnant without intercourse, even if that’s not possible.

After noticing it’s late my stomach has been hurting for so long now. Just now, I felt like vomiting. My anxiety makes me have stomach pain and nausea but everything is a pregnancy sign. I’m super scared on if I’m imagining it or it’s actually happening.

I’m scared if it’s some impossible thing that made me pregnant then I’ll have like powers or something, or maybe be hunted down. Any girls have this problem? Like missing periods and feeling sick? I‘m having a panic attack."

Also I heard knocking noises in my car the worst thing I can imagine is the car breaks down like my past 3 cars and I let my gran down because I bought and wasted 1£k I will give it back but I feel so stressed about it and the noises !

Anxiety,Job interviews after awful experience,"Job interviews are the thing that makes my anxiety the most severe. For some reason it just shuts down my brain. My voice gets so shaky and my mind goes completely blank. 

I have had some decent interview experiences but the last one was so awful. The interviewers were so uninterested and made it so clear that my answers weren't good enough. It was so bad I  considered leaving halfway through. 

Since that interview, I have canceled 3 interviews because I couldn't cope with the thought of them, especially because they were panel interviews. 

But tomorrow I finally have an interview with just one person and I think it's a good place to try get over my last bad experience especially because I am kinda under qualified for it (idek why I got an interview). 

But I'm so scared I'm just gonna freak out and cancel it again :("
Anxiety,Bullshit around spiritual awakening,"Spiritual awakening? No matter how much I talk to these people they say I can’t simply understand. They say the just had a moment one day and were granted eternal happiness. And that they are aware for the first time? It goes against all logic, science, physics and laws of nature. What’s behind it, are they brainwashed or just delusional? Does it have to do something with brain chemicals like dopamine? Like what exactly happened in the brain? Therapy and meds seem useless if something can cure all your problems in a moment and grant you eternal happiness. Having anxiety this rather scares me, it feels like I am getting brainwashed myself. I want to stay sane and not become some kind of monk that tells everyone that that the world is a made up concept in your mind and only one consciousness exists. I would rather die than be this disconnected from reality. Wtf is up with these people?"

Anxiety,Anxiety chest pain,"In the past 13 years, i started playing soccer and running. I ran everyday 5km, 8 years continuously. Today i am 21 years old. I quit soccer and running, and now i do jiu jitsu and often go to the gym. There was a time that i began to panic in the middle of the night because my chest hurt and it was like a squeezing feeling. I went to the hospital and they checked my blood and did an EKG. Everything was normal and they sent me back home. I went to the doctor the next week and he said that it might be a panic attack and i might have anxiety. I refuse to believe it is anxiety because it feels so real. It's so hard to live with it because when i go for a run i feel pressure in the middle of my chest, i feel that my heart sometimes skips a beat and i immediately stop with running thinking i will get a heart attack. I already had a holter, i wore it for like 3 days and they also checked the veins around my heart, they said there is nothing wrong and you dont have to worry and that everything is going to be okay. It is anoying because everytime i work out now and do high intensity training, i get this chest tightness and my heart that is skipping beats, even when i'm not thinking of ""what is going on with my heart"". Does anyone with anxiety has the same feeling as me, even when working out and not thinking about it, like when you're just in the couch doing nothing and watch television? I would like to know your experience. Sorry for my english grammar, i'm from Belgium."
Anxiety,Anxiety is preventing me from getting help for my anxiety,"tl;dr: the process of getting help for my mental health worsens my anxiety. Counselling previously has heightened the symptoms of my mental health struggles. How do I make a break through and get help? Has anyone experienced this before?

So for a bit of a backstory:
I was in counselling but we couldn't get anywhere because I was too heightened. I thought it would pass and it was just the extra stress of starting to attend, but then months went by whilst I never got more comfortable nor did it get any easier to go. 

I wasn't even attending for an anxiety related problem but we couldn't focus on the other stuff properly because I was too anxious during every session. Just the process of going in for the session and having to essentially trust a stranger was too much.

My counsellor mentioned that people are usually happy to come in and they want to talk to her, whilst I was fighting tooth and nail to be there. I thought it was normal for it to be very difficult to go?

I tried to explain to her that this wasn't what I was trying to focus on, and I felt like how I was during sessions wasn't an accurate depiction of my day to day life. I was still able to get what I needed to out, talking about my reason for being there, but she said we wouldn't be able to make progress without tackling my anxiety first anyway and that the anxiety itself was a problem that needed to be addressed whether i acknowledged it or not. 

I was anticipating I would struggle, but not like this. Nothing I envisioned was even comparative to how difficult it actually was.

My counsellor then wanted to refer me out for diagnosis and I essentially ended up ghosting her during the referral process because it was too much. I haven't been back since.

The problem is, now i'm thinking I might need to go back and try counselling or therapy again because I'm not able to make progress independently. Everything is feeling cyclical and I know I don't have the tools to help myself. But I don't know how I'm going to be able to return and make it work. I've had 3 counsellors previously and haven't made progress with any of them.

I understand that maybe she wasn't a good fit for me and I might feel more comfortable with someone else? It just seems impossible to imagine making progress. 

Does anyone have experience with this or something similar?

Anxiety,Any tips on how to manage calling/connecting with people in professional field.,"Im very bad at networking, absolutely hate it as I feel deeply insecure about wether im qualified for a job, wether im legitimate in applying on it.

Anxiety,Anxiety Attack Advice (my 2nd one),"TLDR - My 2nd maybe 3rd anxiety attack ever (years appart) and I don't know how to manage them - Tips/advice welcome

&amp;#x200B;

I have just had my second anxiety attack just before. The last one was maybe 3-4 years ago, so I cant say Im very experienced in how to best manage them  


I'm not sure whats set them off (although Ill include my best guess below), but it's quite overwhelming, I wouldn't describe myself as typically anxious if Im honest

&amp;#x200B;

but the first one I experienced, my mental health wasn't in the best place and I had been struggling, I then broke up with a girl (indirectly as a result of this, I wasn't in a good headspace, and that influenced a lot of how I acted). Straight after it ended and she left I felt I'd lost all control, the last thing that I was holding onto for any stability was gone and I had a full on panic attack

&amp;#x200B;

I've just had my second there, I would say my mental state is actually quite good atm (better than its been for a long time - actually good). But I had a fwb I met recently come to stay for the weekend, we are both extremely clear on this being more of a casual thing, and longterm it wouldn't work, both have completely different life goals, lifestyles, etc. It flat out wouldn't function.,.. also geographically, she leaves for Canada in 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway we had spent the weekend together, and I have never felt more comfortable around another person and being completely myself. We had had sex a few times, gone out for drinks and food over the weekend. When she left earlier, I felt quite anxious but I thought well Ive had a few drinks the last few days (not normal for me), and not great sleep. Its probably a bit of that

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the gym, and on the bus back it was building and building and I started tearing up out of nowhere. Im very sad she had to leave today and even more so she's leaving the country and I may only see her 1 maybe 2 more times. When I got home in the shower I pretty much just started bawling tears and not hyperventilating but I was having an attack

&amp;#x200B;

Note\* I have been to therapy before and one of the topics we spoke about was maybe a slight fear of abandonment or people not liking me for whatever reason that may be. Besides the point

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think situations like this where I maybe open up to people more than normal and then they have to leave for whatever reason are massively triggering for me. And I'll be honest I really don't know how to cope with anxiety attacks and be ok. Like Im struggling right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone with similar experiences or just general advice please let me know, so I can best manage this in the future"

Anxiety,Do you meditate?,"I’ve recently tried meditation as a way to help with my anxiety which I previously thought was only a mental and emotional problem. It’s reminding me of how the mind is part of the body which, to me, means two things: a lot of bodily tension can cause unpleasant symptoms in the mind, and changing the body can be an inroad to changing the mind.

However, to me, meditation is still considerably doubted. Does meditation help anyone else, or do you find it to be a waste of time? If it does help you, do you have any advice for someone just starting to meditate?"

I was abused as a child and never good enough and had to constantly get 100% at school and when I got 100%, my dad would ask me why I didn’t get 110% (no bonus questions, that’s why!) It was never enough. We couldn’t have the school send report cards home because if I had a B (and 15 As, mind you), the B would get me abused. I had to be perfect.

And I think a lot of this is playing out in my work life now. If I’m not perfect at something or a client is mad over something, I spin out and get filled with anxiety.

Anxiety,I cannot remember ever feeling any anxiety in my life that I would classify as even mildly 'problematic'.. A week ago I was in a coffin elevator and felt *panic* for the first time in my life.,"I get it now. I understand what someone means when they start describing what a panic attack is. My empathy for anxiety disorders has gone through the roof. This absolute, primal terror that insanity and/or death is coming to take your consciousness. It literally felt like insanity was crawling into my body and brain. I cant imagine having to deal with constant anxiety coupled with the ever present reality that it could descend into a panic attack whenever it wants.

Some friends don’t always text back. Some friends do not want to hang out. Other friends  are not talking to me because of past issues that recently came up. 

I hate this because when I look at my phone 90% of my conversations begin with me initiating conversation. It’s almost as if I never sent the message, I would never hear from them.

Anxiety,I feel so anxious after social interactions even though I enjoy them at the time,"As I wake up a bit hung over, I am becoming even more acutely aware that my anxiety is becoming worse and worse.

I thought my anxiety was just because of my grad school program or the licensure exam or whatever stressor was happening next and it was normal.

But now my life’s settled, that’s over.... and literally everything I do makes me feel SUPER anxious. But especially any social cue. I get anxious and fixate on small innocuous comments from my bosses or coworkers and start convincing myself they hate me or I’m gonna get fired. Apparently now I can’t even hang out with or chat with friends.

I feel like I am such a weirdo and nobody likes me and I probably made everyone uncomfortable last night. There are no justifications for these thoughts, they’re not based in reality. And I have had them after every social interaction with anyone I know recently. 

It doesn’t help that we were celebrating my birthday and new job so I got super drunk and don’t remember like whole pieces of the night. I’m worried I did something really wrong socially. 

I know this isn’t logical. Do any of you struggle with this? How do you ground yourself?"

Anxiety,worried about pesticides and growth hormones,"Most of us probably know about the growth hormones in meat and dairy products, and pesticides on fruit and veggies. What I'm wondering is, are they dangerous? And will they cause cancer? It's difficult to find locally grown where I live, and growing our own fruit and veggies isn't really an option at the moment"
Anxiety,Heavy feeling in eyes? Not sure how else to describe it.,"I don't know how else to describe this heaviness feeling in my eyes.  I'm not tired and I don't feel dizzy, but I get this feeling in my eyes and forehead area and when I notice it, I can't focus on anything.  I don't know what it is and I've tried describing to my doctor.  Does anyone else get this feeling?"
Anxiety,DAE else remembers so little about their childhood,"so, I have experienced anxiety my whole life and was diagnosed with severe anxiety  4 to 5 years back. 

I rarely remember anything from my childhood, like so little, and the way I remember some events differs from the way my siblings remember them.  I am not sure if memory loss is a symptom of anxiety or not.

or when I am having an anxiety attack, I only remember a sentence or a word I might have said, but not the whole thing like how it started or what I did to calm down.

so, does this happen to anybody else or there is something else wrong with me."

Anxiety,Tooth extraction,"Hi, I made a post a few days ago about getting a tooth extraction and being sedated (awake but woozy) it now turns out that I can’t get sedated so I’m just gonna have to be numbed up. 

This is my first ever tooth extraction and I’m absolutely shitting bricks and it’s not for another week yet. 

How do I calm myself down as I’m sitting at home crying almost every day reading up (success) stories trying to calm myself down.

And now I have read about dry socket, I didn’t know this was a thing. So that’s another thing to worry about. How do I keep my tongue away from the hole? What can I eat? when can I eat normal foods again? when can I smoke my vape again (most importantly lol 😌😂) 

Any advice and do’s or donts are much appreciated :)."
Anxiety,Dating. Am I talking too much?,"Hi! For three years I've been talking with this guy and we are going out. Recently we've been talking everyday and we send some messages back and forth throughout the day but my issue and the reason why I'm spiraling right now, is that I don't know if I'm being too much... like idk if telling him how my day was is too annoying. He always responds and he also sends me things about his day or pictures of animales he has taken but I still worry.
I have VERY little dating experience. That's why I don't know if it's normal or not. Please help."
Anxiety,trust and anxious attachment,"I (female) have been talking to this guy for a few months now . We are both in our early twenties. 

Things have been good, a little TOO good.

He’s nice, understanding, we have similar interests, cute, knowledgeable, self aware, emotionally intelligent, and got his degree. 

We live far from each other so the last time we actually saw each other was before the semester ended. (We weren’t talking then).

If things are going well, why do I have such an impending sense of doom? 

I routinely think that he’s probably going to ditch me, or he’s got another girl he’s more interested in or seeing (which wouldn’t even be something I could complain about because we didn’t label anything). 

And I really don’t want to bring up that conversation because we haven’t really hung out before. It also feel pathetic and clingy if I bring up any talk of exclusivity. 

I can’t seem to enjoy something good because it feels like it has to end. I’m aware this is anxiety and I have an anxious attachment style, but man is it exhausting at times. 

I don’t tend to trust people easily but he managed to earn most of my trust quickly, and that makes me more apprehensive.

I feel like something is going to go wrong, like something nice can’t last. The ball will drop. It’s going to hurt when it does.

TL;DR: things are going well but its hard to trust someone else and trust that things may continue to go well"
Anxiety,0.5mg Clonazepam daily question,"Hello! I’ve been prescribed 0.5mg of Clonazepam daily as needed for anxiety for a couple of years now and have never once had an issue. My psychiatrist told me it would be okay to take everyday, but I’m very cautious and did not do that. I rarely ever took it and only took it when I had a particularly stressful event which amounted to 2-3 times a month at most. HOWEVER, I recently got a new job and was very anxious about it (first real job) and so I took my Clonazepam every weekday (not on weekends) for 4 weeks. I’ve heard horror stories about people withdrawing from daily use even on a dose as low as .5mg and it has me a little concerned. Is a month at this dose long enough to cause a problem? Should I taper down or should I be fine? I don’t want to be reliant on it and I REALLY don’t want to suffer from withdrawals, so how should I go about this? This medicine has been so helpful over the past few years when I really needed it, but I don’t want to cause a problem for myself. Thanks in advance! :)

Anxiety,MS health anxiety,"Hi I’m 22 yom, I’ve been dealing health anxiety on and off for years, it doesn’t help I work in health care as an EMT and constantly see people at there worst, as well as every terrifying medical condition you can imagine, but the past few months it’s been terrible. My most recent fixation has been MS and ALS (also leukaemia but only part time) it’s honestly driving me mad. It started when my tricep started twitching, or more like pulsating. Then every day since then all different parts of my body will twitch.

Of course against my better judgment I googled it, and of course the first thing that catches my paranoid thoughts is ALS. Well I ruled it out (mostly) cause the pulsating isnt isolated to one place or the more distal parts of my arms and legs.  it’s anywhere on my body, (arms, legs, back,pecks, occasionally ears etc..) mostly legs tho. Sometimes it pulsates like once, and other times it’s continuous for for less that 30 secs. It such minuscule thing. I feel like it happens more every day. 

I try to keep it to my self about it, but my girlfriend notices that it upsets me and effects my mood. I dont like to talk to her about it tho because I feel like she gets annoyed, and I don’t want to be a burden or nuance to her. 

I also really don’t want to be seen by a doctor out of shame because I’ve been seen multiple time in the past 5 months for different paranoid health reasons. 

This all sounds ridiculous and Evening reading it back Im honestly embarrassed. I want to enjoy my life and not worry about disease or dying but my anxiety has a tight grip on me. 

Anyway thanks if you read all of this"
Anxiety,Fear of death,"So I (m/24) had my first panic attack in june after I took too much pre workout. Since then life was everything else but easy. Had 2 more panic attacks the week after the first one, both times after sport and/or caffeine. I developed health anxiety, especially about my heart ( I assume cause the pre workout gave me some super high heart rates).

I literally thought I had every possible heart disease out there, but I kind of got better after 2 visits at the cardioligist and after I slowly crawled my way back into sports (especially running and Lifting, still pausing muay thai). So I was doing kind of fine the last two weeks, the only thing that is sticking is the fear of sudden cardiac death. Today, out of the blue, I got some pretty high heart rates for just 2 minute and the whole day was ruined cause it triggered my fear of a sudden cardiac death. Does anybody knows how to deal with this?"
Anxiety,im too anxious to post on social media,"basically the title… i haven’t posted on instagram in months bc i’m too scared that no one will “like” the pics or even see them because of the algorithm. i know if i post more then more people will see my posts, which also makes me anxious. i would delete it but i’m trying to make friends which isn’t working well because i’m too anxious to post. my partner took some pics of me in a cute outfit and i found some pics i dont hate but now they’re pressuring me to post them. im so insecure and anxious"
Anxiety,a weird thing happened,"I was on a flight home around 1am this morning and fell asleep on my partner's knee. I'm okay flying and I wasn't feeling ill or anxious at all, all day before we flew. I woke up suddenly from my nap and sat up feeling like I was on the brink of a panic attack. It was so strange - I wasn't even dreaming of anything. I just woke up and immediately felt awful - hot lower half, cold upper half, stomach cramps, breathlessness. Pure panic set in. I saw there was still an hour to go until we landed and felt even worse. I forced myself to breathe deeply, not wanting to worry my partner or parents I didn't say anything. I managed to gradually calm myself down over the course of the last hour and felt fine by the time we arrived.

It was really bizarre how it just took hold of me as I was asleep, it's never happened to me like that before. Has this happened to anyone else here?

There's also a nice side to this story. I managed to calm down by controlling my breathing, reassuring myself rather than telling myself off, thinking of my favourite things like my cat laying on me, my home, my bed, laying on the beach, swimming. I really feel proud and kind of empowered(?) that I was able to calm myself down. I felt so desperate on that plane, I just wanted to escape but I knew it wasn't possible. And so many times I've let negative anxious thoughts get the better of me"

I am considering letting go of this opportunity because of my anxiety but that seems like a big mistake. Does anyone have any tips on how to get on a place without fainting and crying compulsively the whole time? I genuinely feel that I'm on the brink of death the moment I step foot on the plane until it lands, it's a very difficult thing for me."

Anxiety,I work at an animal Shelter,"Hello,

I suffer from anxiety and PTSD. I work at an animal shelter and its really difficult sometimes. Lately I feel like my coworkers are not very supportive. We have separate departments and I work in the clinic as a VA. You would think my anxiety comes from the work itself but actually its the people around me. One of our animal care departments (cat or dog team) has been emailing my department supervisor complaining about me. I have only ever followed protocol or have gone above and beyond for my patients. 

Recently I feel as though one of the teams (I am keeping this vague for reasons) has been attacking me. Or I at least get this energy that they don’t like me. I don’t know how to handle it as I am someone who constantly thinks of what others think of me. I stayed home because I am not feeling well and all I can think about is work and what could possibly be going on behind my back. 

How do I come to terms and just suck it up and go to work do my job and come home? I can’t ever seem to leave work at work. It makes me want to run away and find another job even though I love my job at the shelter. 

Thanks"
Anxiety,Any adivce? Trigger warning,"I’ll start off by saying I’ve dealt with GAD, social anxiety, health anxiety and some depression since I was 13 about twelve years ago.  It started with a diagnosis of T1D. After that, I struggled in school and eventually dropped out of high school. During that time I was going to therapy because of the anxiety and depression. I was then prescribed zoloft which made me have my first panic attack which then lead to me getting derealization for the first time. I think it lasted for a couple of months and after that I stopped going to therapy and seeing my psychiatrist because I figured I was better.


Fast forward to 2020 when the pandemic started. My family and I caught covid which caused my general anxiety and health anxiety to flare up again. In 2021 I convinced myself I had stomach cancer for a month until I got a colonoscopy/ endoscopy which cleared me. Then this year in May I had my worst and first panic attack since taking zoloft for the first time. I flew to Florida to go to Disneyland with my family. When we got there I hadn't slept for over 30 hours because planes give me anxiety and I it was a red eye flight, so I didn't sleep at all before the flight. The same day of the flight is when we went to Disney where I had my worst panic attack. I stayed in Florida for about a month and didn't really think about the panic attack at all while there.

I return home to NY and started to feel way more socially anxious when going outside. I'd start to profusely sweat when around people which made me even more anxious that people would look at me and think I was weird.

Then around mid August I started having panic attacks almost all the time when leaving my house. I had one just crossing the street of my house to go to the laundromat. I started to worry thinking that everytime I'd leave my house, I'd get a panic attack. That's when I started to feel derealized. At first it felt like the world was different or I was different. Then I started to get like random flashbacks sometimes of being in those panic attacks and how I felt the fear.

Then a whole flood of symptoms started up. Feeling detached from the world, feeling like I'm in a dream or not real, fear I had psychosis or schizophrenia, fear of random things like trees or the sun or the sky or even a brand new shower curtain I'd put up, remembering dreams and memories randomly which made me feel fear even if the memories were good, imagining myself in situations like walking down the street and feeling fear of DP/DR or panic attacks, feeling anxious all day even at home in my bedroom, increased heartrate nearly all day, insomnia and waking up several times a night, a fear of being stuck like this forever, fear of losing my mind, fear of losing control and hurting my loved ones, exsistential thoughts, intrusive thoughts and depression. I've lost most interest in things I like such as video games, netflix exercise,etc. I've also lost about 10 pounds since this started.

I started to go back to therapy again at the same place I went to some 10 years ago even though I was very hesitant because I thought it'd bring back those bad memories of my time in school and the first panic attack I'd had while on zoloft. My therapist has been teaching me grounding and breathing techniques but I'm not sure if they're helping me. I've also told my mom and several family members what I've been going through.

But I've also started to religiously look at forums, social media, youtube all about DP/DR. Like it gives me some reassurance in the moment but I know all these places I've looked at say not to in order to start recovery.

One last thing is that since leaving therapy like 7 years ago, I feel like I've done nothing with my life. I've tried getting my GED but never finished my tutoring, I've never had a job, no friends really or girlfriend, an addiction to porn which I've been trying to quit about a year now. I've spent most of my time in my room isolated. I live with my mom and money has been tight which has also put more stress and worry on me.

Thank you if you read all of this."
Anxiety,Ingrown Toenail,"So this isn’t necessarily anxiety related but health sort of. I just removed a small ingrown toenail (like 10 minutes ago) that has been sort of bothering me for a few weeks. Backstory: back in February I had a heavy bookshelf fall forward and hit my right big toe. I went to the ER and they had to poke a hole to drain blood, etc. My nail died and slowly grew out. Well I noticed I guess maybe in June I had a ingrown toenail but it wasn’t “bad” and it never got bad, I just had some redness on the inside part of my toenail and a very very little bit of puss. Like nothing major. I had been messing with it and yesterday I got something from Walmart to help soften the nail and skin, I did it twice yesterday. Anyway, today it’s out and there’s a “hole” or indention you call it in my skin from where the nail was digging into it. What do I do now? I soaked it in some warm water and the soap the ER gave me. I currently have neosporin and a bandaid on it. Advice? Guidance?"
Anxiety,My stomach pains feels exactly like the anxiety you get in your gut,"I know that eating less is not going to make your stomach issues better, but it’s the only thing I’ve found that helps a little. I eat healthy but my stomach always aches because of its issues and anxiety mixed together"
Anxiety,Eye pressure/Eye pain,I’m sure this is just my anxiety but I wanted thoughts and opinions from other people who have anxiety. But since last night I have had moderate eye pain and pressure with the occasional eye twitch. Is this related to my anxiety or stress? I’m thinking so just because todays my last day at my job and I move tomorrow with my husband and will be living in a new town and start new jobs soon. Is this just my anxiety and stress showing up cause I’m anxious about moving?
Anxiety,Which SSRI medication did help your anxiety the best?,
Anxiety,Alcohol anxiety,"I hear a lot about hanxiety and how people get anxious after drinking, but ive always struggled with actually drinking. The second i start to feel tipsy i completely panic and dissociate and go quiet and feel like i cant talk at all because im focussing so hard on the fact that i dont feel like im real (derealisation) and it usually ends up with me crying in the toilet until i feel a bit more sober and can go and enjoy myself again. Its really annoying because my friend group are all very heavy drinkers and although they never pressure me to drink, i always feel like im missing out on the fun they are having. Ive never once in my life had a shot and ill be 21 soon (in the UK so drinking culture is massive) because i feel like it will get me drunk too quickly and i will freak out. Its really embarrassing going out with people outside of my main group of friends because i have to explain that i dont like drinking and they look at me like im insane. Does anyone else get this because ive never met anyone else who has and i feel pretty alone in my experience."
Anxiety,Medications,What do you take for your anxiety?
Anxiety,night panic attack or some kinda heart fit? Does it need immediate attention?," 

23 male, 5ft 11, 140 lbs.

I've been having heart related anxiety since the start of June. I had my vitals checked with an ecg. All seemed good but I was still worried.

last night I had a stressful day. My brother was being a piece of shit and more or less gaslighting my mental issues, my lfet arm was hurting all day near the armpit. its LIKELY a pulled muscle because my posture is horrid but I kept thinking it was heart related or lymph node issues. I felt anxious right before bed. I got kinda pre panic attack feeling but I took a melatonin and went to bed anyways.

I woke up 3 hours later and I felt a heart palpitation kinda as I was sleeping. it didnt wake up up I was just kinda aware that it happened right before I woke up, and the moment my eyes shot open I just flew this like ""oh shit adrenaline rush"" but it wasn't a lot of like ""panic."" So I layed in bed for like a minute thinking do I try to calm down, do wait for it to hit? My heart was kinda slow at this point, it was still in sleep state. Then I decided to pee and when I stood up my heart started beating really fast which sometimes happens. Depending on when I wake up sometimes its beating slow but other ties it gets really fast. And this time it was fast but I just figured ah its fine. Then when I came back to m bed it was still kind racing, maybe like 110 beats? But then I got hit with this panic. Like what if THIS is it? like for reals. And I started to panic and got super bad cold chills., like borderline convulsions, I was shaking so hard. when I measure my pulse I counted for 15 seconds and got about 32 beats but I was I was kinda like estimate counting during this panic wave so it could've been between like 32-35 in 15 seconds meaning it was beating about 128-140 which is kinda how my panics go.

My heart stayed around 120-130 for like 5-10 mins and then I sat down and tried to calm down and over like an hour it was around 80-100 and then another hour later I was able to finally go to sleep.

Now again I dont know. could that really be a panic attack? I stood woke up, got hit with this ""h shit here we go"" but I wasn't like even scared or panicked, I was too tired for that, but standing up to go pee stirred up my heart and THEN I freaked out thinking it wasn't coming down, it shot up to 130-140 for like 5 mins and then was elevated and took about an hour to fully go backdown to like idk 70-80s and then took about another hour for me to be able to fall back to sleep.

I had a check up and ecg 4 months ago, I was told here are no signs of cardio vascular disease... Was that really just panic I dont usual have night panic attacks. Im just scared what if its some kinda SVT, or arrhythmia, or afib type thing that everyone keeps missing...

Is this something that need immediate medical attention? Im shaken up and just more worried about my heart now. I know people deal with these things and are fine but Im paranoid. does this need medical attention?"
Anxiety,Stop monitoring your heart rate,"Unless you have a diagnosed and/or 100% confirmed condition that requires you to be monitoring your heart rate, please, try to ween off of your monitor. Especially if you have health anxiety.

I browse this sub to provide comfort and one of the most common issues I see on here is people panicking about their heart rate. As someone with health anxiety I can't imagine even having access to a heart monitor. I don't think y'all realize that you're dooming yourselves to a cycle of anxiety every time you check the numbers.  You get anxious, which increases your heart rate, and then you check your heart monitor and get more anxious about your increased heart rate, which increases your heart rate.

I would really, really recommend to make some effort to stop 24/7 monitoring your heart rate, and if you're thinking about getting a heart monitor, to not do so. When you're having anxiety or feeling weird, fixating on your heartrate is genuinely bad for you. Focus instead on treating your symptoms directly with breathing exercises, rest, and as-needed meds if you have access to them."
Anxiety,Waking up feeling completely different,DAE wake up sometimes and just feel completely alien and strange? Like very fundamentally different to how they felt the day before? I woke up today with blurry vision and the overall feeling like my brain had been swapped. I guess this could be DPDR but I hate it.
Anxiety,Anxiety about unexpected life events/accidents,"Whenever some incident happens in my life, I enter some sort of anxious cycle. It can be relatively small stuff which would normally annoy a normal person for a couple of days (e.g. hitting a wall while parking and scratching my car) but which in my case tends to degenerate into some sort of ""self-punishment"" process: I have messed up because I am careless, and I will be careless in the future. For a few days I will feel restless, with low apetite, lack of focus, racing heart and ruminating thoughts about the situation, which I am convinced I could have avoided. For instance, if it's a bad experience while driving, I will want to avoid driving, afraid of doing something wrong with more serious consequences. I'll be ashamed of talking about the incident, fearing that people will judge me for it. Or that I will just mess up again, because I am a distracted person by nature and feel pretty embarrassed by that.

Does anyone have the same sort of thoughts/feelings? I am on medication since a long time and things are normally under control. It's only when these ""small storms"" happen that I end up in this state, normally for a week or two."

Anxiety,I hate this,I go back to college soon and that is sort of where we start. I have terrible social anxiety when I’m in unfamiliar environments and that’s exactly what happened last year I was in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people. I didn’t become as close as I would’ve like with the kids there. I bonded more with older kids in my brothers class and house but they all graduated so that sucks but it’s also ok. I’m going to be a junior and I just don’t know what to expect. Everybody there loves me as a person and I love them they are awesome people. But as I grow closer to going it feels more and more like I’ve never been there. I can’t really say why. But the thing that sucks is that I see peoples stories on snap and shit and I’m like wow I can’t wait to go it’s gonna be so fun. And I see all the beautiful girls I wanna talk to (that part was unnecessary but true especially because I feel more confident in my ability to talk to girls now for some reason). I just hate that I have these two opposing mindsets that are controlling me and it sucks because I leave Sunday and time just seems to be going slower the closer it gets because I wanna go more sometimes and then other times I literally have a panic attack thinking of seeing people.
Anxiety,Propranolol - When will it stop making me sleepy?,"I’ve been on Propranolol (10mg) for two weeks now for anxiety. First week was amazing, no side effects, anxiety was basically non existent. Second week, the tiredness side effect has kicked it. The word “tired” doesn’t even describe what I’m feeling each day to be honest. It gets to around 2/3PM and I’m struggling to keep my eyes open. 

Anybody know if this is a temporary side effect that will eventually phase out or am I stuck with being this sleepy everyday? 

Would love to hear peoples personal experience on Propranolol too. ☺️"

Anxiety,Does anyone have experience with finding a WFH job while dealing with severe anxiety?,"I have panic disorder (diagnosed, four hours of panic attacks a day really sucks) and agoraphobia (undiagnosed, but I get a panic attack when I leave the house. I have to take a Klonopin to even get the mail some days).

It developed rapidly out of nowhere about a year ago, I went to a psych ward, was on Lexapro and Klonopin except I can't afford to see the doctor to renew my Lexapro script so I'm currently weening off of it.

It's been hard, and the lack of income after years of working 60-80hrs a week is hurting me and my relationship.

I just genuinely don't know where to start even finding a WFH entry-level job. I've been working in Kitchens from cook to management, designing menus, etc,. I even worked part time in a family bounce-house business until it was sold, and it's all screwed because of my brain lmao.

I have to start over at almost thirty, and working from home sounds like a godsend. I'm technically inclined but haven't had any certificates since web design in HS, but I know my way around a computer. I'm just paralyzed with even trying to figure out where to turn.

Like, everything looks like a scam, I don't know who is and isn't a legitimate company, I've never even used LinkedIn but I guess I need to set up a profile? I'm so lost and it makes me shut down.

I've been about two months panic attack free so I think I can affectively work as long as I don't need to leave, my ability to cope with stress is a lot lower than it used to be though. I just want a nice eight hours a day, five days a week, minimum wage job. Nothing crazy. I just don't know where to go.

I thought y'all might know a bit to help. Where to look? What to do? What skills are needed?

Thank you!"

I remember being quite jittery before and getting restless legs alot but nothing like this. 

I'm only 2 days in and I'm a wreck. My body feels weak and my hands shake and Im not sure if that feeling is high untreated anxiety or the meds.

Anxiety,Anxiety and addiction treatment therapy,"Hi everyone.

Since i switched new antipsychotics. My anxiety became more aware. My therapists tell me I’m addicted to sedatives and alcohol because I use those for my anxiety. I will have to get therapy for my addiction as well. As I’m not addicted to alcohol or sedatives, I can go without easily if I wouldn’t have anxiety this much. But if my anxiety won’t go away I will get physically addicted as well as I’m mentally addicted to numbing my anxiety. 

Anyone have been in the same boat? And how has addiction-treatment therapy helped you?"

My teacher called me 8 times and my mom told me I’m a waste of money. 
I cried so much. I have to walk the dog now but I’m scared my teacher will see me somehow and tell me how mad she is. I’m also scared she’ll text me something."
Anxiety,I JUST WANT TO SLEEP HELP,So for the past week as I am on my 7th week back of zoloft after terrible SSRI withdrawals (I was on it previously for 2 years) my hallucinations has been through the roof and I am terrified. They have been worse at night. Everytime I drift off to sleep I hear a DING and it jolts me awake or I’ll hear a voice. I heard “oh no” as I was falling asleep and it shot me right awake and now I’m wired. It’s like my brain doesnt want me to sleep bc everytime I try a auditory hallucination wakes me right on up. Yesterday as I was trying to sleep I closed my eyes to sleep and had a vivid closed eye hallucination of a guy waving goodbye and it made me jump awake. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do. I’m lost and I feel like I have no way out besides death to stop this. I have a schizophrenic sister and I am terrified. I can’t take it!

Anxiety,Anxiety about lifedirection and relationship,"Hi all

Im (27/F) currently in a serious state of anxiety and would love some outside takes on my situation. 

Relevant:  I've been diagnosed with GAD since very young. Usually it's controlled and only shows up frome time to time when many life changes are present or I am particularly stressed. 

Right now most of my stress and anxiety stems from the fact that I very recently got married and feel like the whole thing is making me question all my life choices and if I can live up to everybodies expectations. 

I am currently 27 and have gotten married to my high school boyfriend, whom I've been together with since 17. We have - of course - changed a lot throughout the years, but I actually feel like it has been very good for our relationship - we truely work wonderfully together. He's my favorite person and the one I truely feel like I can share everything with. I've also expressed all of this to him. I love him dearly and really believe we will have a wonderful lige together. I see myself having children with him in the near future. 

We got engaged two years ago, and all througout the process of planing the wedding I've been exited and felt like it was a very natural course for our relationship. But about 1 month before the wedding I was fit with crazy anxiety, mostly revolving around if we are too young and if we/I have experienced enough in life. The best way I can describe it is as a quater-life crisis. 

I really dont know how to get through this. I have elevated heartbeat, sweats, chest pains. When I truely sit down and think about us, I feel calmer - because my logical self understands that I really love him and that marriage does not change anything in our relationship - as he says ""well, if it doesn't work out, we could just get a divorce, it doesn't have to be the end of everything"" but I feel like my ind can't seperate that marriage does mean something much more significant. I feel like everybody have expectations, and will ask about whats for us now. It makes my head dizzy. 

I feel like it has come out of nowhere and is ruining something I really want to feel exited about. 

I see a therapist and have (as of today) made an appointment with my doctor about medication. I feel like the anxiety symptoms makes me unable to think clearly about all of it, and therefore hope that medication will help - but I also know that it might not. I really do not want to act rashly. 

Do you have any advice to handle my situation? 

Sorry about the english, it's not my first language."
Anxiety,got out of anxiety + depression and here's how,"I started to notice how every time I was anxious, sad, or angry, it was because I was using too much of my head. In other words, I was overthinking too much, like right now. Then, I stopped thinking and could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste again. It was like thinking blocks your entire view of what's going around.

I went outside, and put my attention to how everything sounded. Even the cars, dogs barking, and the wind blowing all sounded equally peaceful. This all helped me stop thinking sexually, be happy consistently, and be way more productive.

A mindset I started to apply was not allowing myself to be anxious ever again. When I feel slightly anxious, straight up just said to myself 'no, not again. Stop thinking about the future it hasn't happened yet.'

There are people who just want to be anxious. For those, do what makes you happy more often. If you have no clue, look around and try as much things as you can. I hope I could help"
Anxiety,art sharing anxiety and imposter syndrome,"I wanted some advice from others who have shared similar experiences to mine. 

I draw digital art for a hobby and participate in an anime fandom by drawing fan art. I have terrible anxiety when I try to share art. My anxiety is worse with larger social media platforms but is easier to manage in small discord servers. I find myself deleting art I've posted on discord servers often and only sharing a very small percentage of art that is usually ""funny"" on social media. 

I don't have many bad experiences with sharing art. I generally don't care if people dislike my art and I thrive off of genuine feedback. I get horribly overwhelmed and flustered from positive comments. It raises my anxiety and I want to delete what caused me to be overwhelmed. It makes me anxious when people collect my art like pokemon cards with an abnormal disconnect where they can't understand the art was made by a human being. I get anxious when people treat me weird like I'm some intimidating celebrity. 

I have terrible imposter syndrome. My art has significantly improved in the last 2yrs because I met 2 people who are professional artists with college degrees and work experience. They have been teaching me. It took me a year to accept I was an artist and not just a healthcare worker. I feel like I can't take credit for my art because it's technically the talent of my friends who taught me and not my own abilities. I have difficulty accepting payment for commissions and it took me a long time to price myself appropriately. I have difficulty accepting that my art may be considered ""good"" when I feel like I'm constantly stagnant and needing improvement.

If people have had similar experiences, how do you handle the anxiety associated with imposter syndrome and the anxiety of your art being perceived? How do you not become overwhelmed and anxious with positive feedback?"

Anxiety,what should I do,Would doing LSDs after doing DMT 5 hours later and still feel high
Anxiety,Some words that could help,"I just find this sub and I want to say some things.

1. This is the second time I am going through anxiety and it  is a hard and weird thing to experience and I know you could feel like you don’t remember how it is to feel normal but you will feel normal and good again and in the same way don’t remember how it was to feel anxious all the time or even understand how could you were in that state.

2. What you are experiencing is real, all the symptoms and is because your body is in a state of stress, even if you are calm or relaxed most of the time your body is still affected and alert. so give it some time to heal and don’t give up to stress thinking is not going away, it will go, I promise.

3. If you can, seek for treatment and follow it with confidence, sometimes is scary to take this kind of meds but we have to trust experts and do all we can to be well, also change everything you can that is stressing you, is hard but you have to try and even if is just 1 thing you can change it will be a little less stress for your body.

4. I hope you feel well soon and better each day 💜"
Anxiety,Sertraline made me very sick,"I started my first dose of 25mg Sertraline yesterday. I took it at 10pm, after food with water. I had mild nausea at 3-4am. Didn't think much and went to sleep. I woke up at 6am with a violent urge to vomit, however there was nothing coming out. I was having cold sweats and feeling faint, and ended up going to the hospital. They administered Ondansetron via IV.

12 hours later, I'm still having nausea and feeling horrible.Didnt manage to eat a thing today. Perhaps I have some sort of SSRI intolerance? Tried 2.5mg Lexapro and I also had bad nausea 6 hours after taking it. It was much worse with Sertraline however.

I would rather stuffer with my anxiety than to suffer the side effects of this drug. Working with my psychiatrist to try something else and hopefully it works out."
Anxiety,I accidentally hit a car's back windscreen wiper with my elbow,"And now I am afraid that I broke something, although I felt nothing breaking, other than perhaps my elbow as it did hurt.

I am about to leave this country in a couple weeks and I am very afraid of owing something and remaining unaware of it, it was a small Tesla car.

I am feeling so much anxiety right now because of this..."
Anxiety,I ruined my only friendship with my own cowardice.,"Yesterday I was due to leave to travel abroad and meet a long time internet friend; for the few weeks leading to yesterday I was terribly anxious and every fiber in my body wanted to cancel due to my extreme social anxiety and fear of being away from home, but I held on thinking ""it'll pass"".

For context, I haven't left my bedroom in 3 years, I only go outside to see my therapist and psychiatrist, whom prescribes me antidepressants, antipsychotics and xanax, I get anxiety from taking out the trash, so I don't know what I was thinking when I agreed to travel 2000 miles away from my home.

Days go by and my anxiety only gets worse, I'm unable to eat or sleep as the date of the trip gets closer, but on the surface I was still acting confident to try and fool myself into thinking this was a good idea.

So the day arrives, I was due to leave at midnight to be there in the morning, anxiety levels are sky high, and only two hours before I had to leave I finally broke down and had a full on panic attack, during which I cancelled the trip and locked myself into my room, and spent the rest of the night crying and hugging my pillow.

Now my one and only friend is deeply hurt by my actions, and I have a feeling that there's no coming back from this.

I have nothing left to lose now, my chest is burning and I just want to disappear."
Anxiety,Need help for anxiety and depression,"I (17M) have been suffering from severe anxiety and social anxiety my whole life, from about 4-5 years of age. I was first diagnosed in 2011, and then put under medication for it. I became addicted to it. The medicine was then abruptly stopped in September 2018, after about 7 years. 

This caused me to go into severe depression. I had manic episodes, dissociative episodes, depressive episodes and suicidal tendencies. I was taken off from school for a year. I started another medicine, which helped me greatly and almost cured me, but caused me to gain an excessive amount of weight (30 kgs). My parents put me in an alternative school in Oct '19, which basically means a smaller class size, less pressure and more freedom for the students. I spent about 3 years there, and passed 10th grade in May '22. I was comfortable there and made a few good friends. Then, a couple of months ago, I was put in a mainstream school, and I just could not adjust to the environment. 

Schooling has been a major issue for both me and my parents my whole life. When I was a child, my mother used to sit with me in class everyday for 3-4 months. I would vomit every day. As I grew older, joined other schools and went through different experiences, my mother obviously no longer had to sit with me, but my anxiety was always there. Sometimes it was so bad that I could not function properly, other times it was a little less severe.

Back to the point. After attending the new school for about a month, things were no better. I was undergoing major anxiety attacks everyday before school, and at school, I felt completely alienated and just separate from everyone and everything. I wasn't able to focus in class. After such a long break from regular schooling, I was unable to adapt to this environment. We decided to consult a new psychiatrist and counsellor. They changed my medicines completely, but this time, instead of abruptly stopping them, they were phased off gradually, over the period of a month.

I tried another school, and it was better than the first one, but this time, my issue was not with anxiety. I have been attending this school for a month now, and feel comfortable there, and am starting to make a few friends. Now that my medicine has been phased off completely, my depression has come back again. I have lost my appetite. I feel exactly like I used to 4 years ago. At school, I am completely numb, and I feel extremely low and have no energy. I am barely able to get through the classes, much less pay attention. I do not feel like doing anything. The simple task of getting up in the morning feels exhausting, much less getting through an 8-hour school day. I don't know what to do. Perhaps I should ask the doctor to continue the medicine again, but that way, how will I ever get out of it? I can't take it for the rest of my life. I need to stop it. I am considering homeschooling. My father is for it, but my mother is against it. 
I feel helpless. My doctor doesn't feel helpful, my parents neither.

Could somebody please give me advice on how to get out of this situation? What should I do? How can I get better?"
Anxiety,Heightened anxiety causing issues in relationship,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and I am deeply in love with him. Recently due to anxiety mixed with identity issues (we’re both Indians by background) I’ve been starting more fights spurred by anxiety of the future. We’ve not been able to see each other frequently for the last two months due to travel/other commitments, and I feel like my anxiety is out of control. A lot of these arguments are about me not having certainty over fairly minor issues in hindsight or feeling like small things (I.e. him not replying to my messages frequently, which I know is my own issue and unreasonable to spiral). During our arguments he is fairly quiet and hears me out.

I’m not sure how to go back to normal after we’ve had these arguments spurred by anxiety, how to apologize enough or even stop getting anxiety about the anxiety. I feel like all I can think about sometimes after an argument is how undeserving I am to be with someone so patient and the problems I cause in his life. I don’t know how to get out of this headspace.

I usually used to smoke weed for anxiety, but have stopped that for about 8-9 months, and have no other coping mechanism except let myself spiral/isolate myself even further. 

My chest gets tight frequently when things are bad, often unable to eat or concentrate on anything else. I’m not on medication but I do see a therapist.

TLDR; how to get back to normal after having fights spurred by anxiety"

Anxiety,advice on keeping contact with mom,"My parents are spliting since my mom was not happy with the relationship and was just done with it.  When she said they were splitting things got heated and she left and ended up getting a restraining order. Ive talked to them both since this, my dad is pissed and does not want me talking to her at all as he thinks she will use it as more ""evidence"" to make him look back legally. I still love both of them and want to keep in touch with my mom without my dad getting pissed at me for it. Idk what to do. I want a solution that does not make anyone paronoid or mad as my dad still pays my car insurence and phone which i need and am not in a position to loose rn."
Anxiety,Could this be due to a panic attack?,"So, I have a history of anxiety - always been an anxious person, clammy hands, anxiety and panic attacks, I was on sertraline for a while a few years ago as well as propranolol. 

I work in IT, and I caused a massive outage in one of the departments network wise. All pressure was on me, I didn’t even realise it but I ended up with sweat literally dripping down my face, fast heart rate, clammy hands, etc… whilst trying to fix the problem. 

I assume this was a panic attack. 

Everyday since, I’ve not been right. 

I have brain fog, and the only way I can describe it is like I’m half under water whilst the rest of the world is above ground. I can hear what people are saying to me but there’s either a delay in processing it or I can’t process it. 

Nothing feels real. 

I keep pressing the wrong buttons on my phone, and I can’t read information properly. Even typing this is hard! 

My hands are also incredibly clammy. 

Could this be due to what happened earlier this week? Could I still be feeling the effects? 

I’m worrying it’s something else but I was fine before the outage happened. 

I’m also massively fatigued. 

Thank you for your help."
Anxiety,Nothing helps besides benzos,"I literally tried everything… antipsychotic-anti-depressant. Everything made me very sick and or unable to function. I’m on Effexor now and it’s god awful…. I’m gonna call my doctor to ask him that I don’t want to continue with it. Anyways in general Anxiety through out the day is okay but I just want to sleep. Sleep is so hard… I can’t fall asleep with out being sedated. My own heart beat makes me crazy. Sometimes, well now more common I wake up in terror with high anxiety. If I actually sleep it’s super stressful. I sleep maybe 2-4hrs a night … I just want to be like others where they can sleep. The only thing that keeps me okay is Ativan… I take 1-2mgs at night depending on how bad I feel. I know it’s not a long term solution. I try not taking it every night so I don’t get used to it. I wish there is something else like it."

Anxiety,Really need support right now.,"You know how everyone’s solution to mental illnesses is tell someone? I can’t. My anxiety is literally stopping me from telling my mum.
I was thinking about how my mum doesn’t really listen while driving. I mean, you tell her something unimportant to her and she’ll just say yup or mhm. Like if I tell her about my day. That thought got me spiralling into an anxiety attack about how if I told her about everything (anxiety, OCD, horrid intrusive thoughts, friends fighting, etc.), she would brush it off and ignore me.
I can’t tell anyone at school either. I basically have three versions of myself. Class me- the lonely girl who talks to no one and basically no one knows. Friend me- chatty, friendly me with a cool mum and lots of pets. And home me- the empty shell of a person only tied down by music and video games. If I told my friends about home me, I can’t help but fear that they would think I’m crazy and slowly cut me off.
I’m on no medication and have no therapy because my mum doesn’t know how bad it is, but I really want to talk to someone.
Can anyone help me??"
Anxiety,I got diagnosed with GAD and given Zosert 25mg everyday for 2 weeks. Should I take the meds?,"I'm 20M having severe procrastination problems, loneliness and general sadness everyday (for the past month they were severe that I felt that the need to get consulted). I had went to a psychiatrist initially for ADHD, Depression and Anxiety diagnosis but the psychiatrist only paid attention to the first 10-15 mins of what I was saying (I was talking about anxiety), and didn't question anything related to ADHD (like whether I had problems paying attention or anything), and mainly questioned related to anxiety and depression. She also gave me an ink-blot test for some reason, I don't know why.

Finally she said she had to go soon to check other patients, so she said ""you don't seem to have other problems, it's just anxiety, and I'm giving you a prescription for it"" and gave a prescription for GAD and said to take Zosert 25mg at 9 AM everyday for 2 weeks. I asked about the side effects and she said there's none. I also asked why she didn't question about ADHD symptoms and she said ""ADHD doesn't come suddenly, and usually starts at childhood.. since you're having problems only for this month, it can't be ADHD"". I did mention again that I've had attention problems for longer.. like 6 years or more.. but she didn't consider it..

And as she left she told a psychologist to substitute for her.. The psychologist asked further questions about anxiety and stuff.. and said stuff like ""you're 20 and you are lonely and aren't working out or exercising or anything.. you're too young to be weak.. you need to get yourself together and start doing stuff.."". I then mentioned that I've been trying to get on a work out schedule for ages but it's been really hard to set up a schedule and then following it is even harder.. for this she replied ""you just need to push yourself and do it. There's no other option."". There's a thing with ADHD people and procrastinating too much.. Idk if she even gave a thought to it..

In the beginning, when I listed all my symptoms she literally said like ""it feels like you just googled the symptoms for these 3 problems and then recited it to me.. I don't think you have them.. don't google stuff related to these again"".. like cmon, people do google stuff but I do have some of those symptoms I'm not just pulling them out of my ass you know.. but they didn't care and diagnosed for just GAD.. And I also doubt if whatever they did was right.. like why ink blot test all of a sudden for me? Isn't it usually done for schizophrenic people?

So after all this I'm wondering if I should take the meds due to the lack of credibility of these doctors.. They literally said there's no side effects for Zosert when I asked about it, but a quick google tells you plenty.. I don't want to get on meds as I don't want my life to become dependent on them.. I'm also worried about side effects and withdrawal symptoms.. what should I do?"
Anxiety,my anxiety is eating me,"It's been a week or so but i can't still sleep.

I don't know what is happening but all i know is it's getting worst each day. I also don't cry. I just stare in the unknown for hours. I can't shut down my thoughts it's louder than before. I am pressured because i am graduating this year and the expectations that my parents gave me is so high that i don't think i can ever reach. My self esteem is pretty low. I have no one to talk to. I'm having relationship problems and it's stressing me out so much. I just feel that i can't trust anyone anymore. I am so tired. I haven't comb my hair and i tried self harming because i can't feel anything and i regret doing it. My sister and i is sleeping in the same room and i thought it will help me but it is all the same i still can't sleep. I also spend time with my family to feel that bond but still nothing.

I finally realized the big drops give me the most anxiety because I’m on edge of what’s coming next, they’re usually followed by fireworks, fire shooting up etc. I hate it, I just have a complete sensory overload. 

Last night, I came to the conclusion that I think I attended my last music event with him and it made me really sad.

Anxiety,"Is this anxiety, an anxiety attack or a panic attack?","Lately after my suicide attempt and my docs changing me from Paroxetine to Pristiq, I’ve generally been feeling sick (nauseous) very often. Every time I leave the house I desperately just want to go home because I don’t have the energy (thanks to severe depression), and all I want to do is to go home and cry because I feel so unsettled and just sick to my stomach. It has made me want to quit my job and skip my dance classes because I don’t want to leave the house anymore. It’s been harder to get a full breath in all the time. 

Sometimes I then start to breathe extra hard and I start to have a foggier brain (like my brain is stuffed with cotton) and my ears get tunnel hearing and becomes sensitive to all sounds. My body starts to feel very distant from me. I start checking my pulse because I get heart palpitations. My hands start to get pins and needles (probably due to my breathing). I start feeling so uncomfortable that I cry. 

I’ve never considered myself to have anxiety (but apparently my pdoc thinks I do have anxiety with the depression), but I do have PTSD. I’m starting to think my general anxiety is showing up though, with all these fears of going to my job or leaving the house. I don’t know if these attacks with all those symptoms I shared above is the result of a PTSD episode (although I don’t notice any specific triggers), if they are panic attacks, if they are anxiety attacks, or just normal anxiety. 

If someone could clue me in, that would be so helpful. Just sitting here crying after one of these episodes rn."

I  read that it has a high chance of giving you permanent tardive    dyskinesia , but by the fact that tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of    all of the antipsychotics is there a chance that I would take it from    Trifluoperazine ? Or I'm just immune to that since i Didn't get it  from   the others ?"
Anxiety,Dying from Anxiety,"Need serious help, feel lost and don't know what to do. Medical help isn't an option for me and neither is a therapist.

 used to be the most chill and laid back person in the world, and enjoy every second of my life. Oh how that has changed. I don't know what led to my anxiety being like this, but it keeps getting significantly worse. To begin, last year I got into a relationship where my partner acts in a way I am not used to (ie: not resolving a fight immediately, leading me to have a panic attack lasting from the fight's start to finish which can often last multiple days). I believe the relationship has a strong impact on my anxiety at times. Next, not being friends with my best friend anymore could be a factor, which happend about one year ago. Without her, I feel like I am all alone in the world. When we were together, I felt like the best version of myself possible and extremley confident and happy. That feeling is no longer present, ever.

My anxiety is so bad up to the point where at every second in the day, it feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest. I spend all day crying in my bed, freaking out for no reason. I can't sleep unless I smoke weed. I constantly am nervous, and have panic attacks that can last hours. I constantly am shaking and resisting the urge to cry.

 I am feeling depression about my life and want to change everything: move to another country, get all new friends, etc. I just don't want to regret my choice. Either way, this change wouldn't be able to happen for a year. But I really don't want to live another year miserable and unable to function properly. Please help, I have no idea what to do or why I have become like this."
Anxiety,Anxiety hampers my productivity and lowers my self-esteem,"I set certain goals for myself and try to do my best to achieve them but whenever I try to focus on any productive activity intrusive thoughts make it very difficult for me to focus. For example, I may obsess over feeling degraded or insulted by how someone treated me especially if someone insults me for making a mistake even if it is minor because then the insult has some validity and I take that personally even if there's nothing personal about it and the person who insults me knows is a complete stranger. I know I should focus on my mistake but can't get over feeling degraded or humiliated and let that person's behaviour affect my self-esteem. Other than that I may feel excessive guilt over something I did and feel that I do not deserve a sense of fulfilment if I am able to focus and use my time productively. Then I feel very upset that I could not use my time productively despite trying my best to because my intrusive thoughts make it very difficult for me to function. Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you cope with it?"
Anxiety,Scary feeling do I have a brain tumor lol,"Hello, I’m a 24(f) and I honestly used to struggle with anxiety a lot but as I’ve grown up it hasn’t been a major issue. I have things that scare me but it doesn’t stop me from doing them. The only major thing I’d say is I don’t drive bc anxiety…which I will be forcing myself to start doing soon.

I have a good job, and a good life. Luck always seems to find me. But lately things have been so hard and I’ve been getting this horrible disgusting creepy feeling.

I’ve had a lot of big life changes lately. My boyfriend and I bought our first house and my nana (my dads mom) passed away. She is the first grandparent to go and I’ve never experienced the death of someone close to me before until now.

I have a really hard time moving and change is a struggle for me. I know it’s gross but I usually don’t feel comfortable showering for the first two weeks until I’ve deep cleaned the shower 10 times and I haven’t even set foot in the bath yet despite all my scrubbing. It’s just been a struggle. Things aren’t perfect and it feels like it’s one thing after the other with my new house. 

Then amongst that my nana dies and I took a day off work then went back and I am barely making it. I’m so tired and burnt out. 

Then the past couple weeks, well really this feeling started when we moved in on august 4th, I’ve been getting this horrible sickly feeling that starts in my head and goes in a wave through my body and ends in the pit of my stomach. I feel dizzy, nauseous and scared.

This weird deja vu usually triggers it. It’s like I’m recognizing things and situations from my dream. I’ve had deja vu before but never this often and it’s never sent me into such a horrible feeling. It’s a feeling of absolute dread, like impending doom. It lasts for about 30 seconds and I’m left feeling confused and scared, and anxious. 

Does anyone know what this feeling is? I’ve gone through a lot in my life, the abuse of an ex, dropping out of college, etc and unless my memory has blocked out all that traumatic shit it feels like this is the first time I’m experiencing this feeling."
Anxiety,Too much tension and conflict in my house,"Today my family were going to enjoy a nice meal tgt at home. But my brother was arguing with my mother then my father came home and my mother immediately yelled at him so he got irritated and yelled back. 

Now my mother won’t come out for dinner and my brother told me to go check on her even though I did nothing. And I really hate conflicts and tension, I hate when my family just argues with each other and sends me in to fix the stupid broken pieces. Like, it feels like they can’t take responsibility for their mistakes?

Now I feel like vomiting because I couldn’t do anything and the next few days are either going to be tense and cold or a fiery argument. I sort of feel like it’s my fault too because I was just so useless in mitigating the situation."
Anxiety,I feel anxious almost around everybody and I think I look weird pls help,"so I recently moved away from my parents to a different country, for some reason I am always anxious even though no one is doing anything bad. idk. it feels like I act very timid which makes me even more anxious and embarrassed. 

pls help how do I reduce my anxiety"

Anxiety,people be treating you bad and making you feel like shit no? hahahahaha 🙂🙂,
Anxiety,I’m really scared,Something feels off. Like i don’t feel like myself. I’m scared that something bad is going to happen. I don’t want to die and it’s all i can think about. I want to feel happy and alive again. i’m literally freaking out. my anxiety used to be very physical and now it’s really mental. I feel like the way i’m thinking doesn’t even feel like me. i’m scared that I have a brain tumor but i’ve been to so many doctors over the past 2 years and i’ve had brain scans. I just feel like they missed it and i’m freaking out. Idk what to do i can’t relax because i’m so convinced i’m going to die. I really just want to feel like me again. I wasn’t even like this 2 months ago. I’m scared.
Anxiety,Talking to women,"My anxiety is so bad that just scrolling dating site gives me anxiety, not to mention when I would talk to a woman there. I don't understand why it makes me so nervous, my hands get sweaty, I feel dizzy, I once went to a date and I couldn't speak with a clear voice because I was so anxious"
Anxiety,Venting my mind out,"Life is going downhill real fucking fast. It all started with the gym i wanted to do something productive during summer break im 17, terrible lifestyle looking for a change. Im unsure if this was due to overexertion but after leaving the gym i got stabbing pain in my heart and after a few minutes of this i got really dizzy, i thought i was fine, every time after the gym this would repeat minus the heart pain, after a week i went to the er, did some googling and thought i had a heart attack or something, Dr runs some tests blood,urine, 24 hour holster, chest x-ray. Everything is clear im healthy besides vitamin D deficiency. I was insanely anxious/stressed trough out this whole proccess since i google about heart stuff. It never left. Went back home but now since my heart is healthy, my brain found another problem, maybe its a brain tumour or maybe that cyst in my thyroid that my doctor found turned cancerous? Ive been on an endless cycle. This started around mid july and its been a bit over a month now. I went from slight worry to common numbness,pins and needles in my arms, legs, head, Possibly insomnia cause i keep waking up every night and also feel exausted trough out the day, brain fog (Why i think its a brain tumour), chest pain. Im going to get my stomach checked next week due to chest pains. If they find nothing im afraid i won't be able to keep my sanity. I want to see a doctor again this time maybe tell them about these thing i developed over the month and either get help or get sent to psychiatrist or something, but i cannot i already went to a doctor and i missed my chance to tell them, my parents are very annoyed, they will most likely get mad and refuse to take me. Im at a point where i feel like i might break down, i feel like i want to cry but tears just don't come out. School starts in 7 days 12th grade, im already screwed mentally, what will an extra layer of stress and responsibilities do to me? Im completely lost, afraid. Ive been trembling slightly and getting lots of tingles, hopefully thats just anxiety at work."
Anxiety,Thinking everyone hates me is debilitating,"I come home from work and it’s all I can think about. I physically cringe thinking about interactions I’ve shared with people that are probably very normal interactions. It has caused me to stop myself from becoming close to anyone because I am *convinced* that they secretly don’t like me and are saying awful things behind my back.

I have met some amazing people recently who are truly trying to connect with me but I’m struggling to ground myself in reality and recognize that these are genuine connections and maybe these people don’t actually hate me. I’m exhausted"
Anxiety,Should I seek help for my anxiety?,"**I tried posting this from a throwaway but the post was deleted and the account banned, so I'm doing it again from my main.**

*Kind of a long post, but please read all of it, I need some advice.*

Recently it feels like my anxiety has gotten worse than ever before. I feel nauseous multiple times a day, and it's lasted on occasion for more than an hour. It's not like I need to throw up immediately, but it's this constant feeling in my stomach that occasionally makes me feel like I have to retch, and it makes it kinda difficult to eat (on top of worrying making me lose my appetite). And today when this happened, for a few minutes, my stomach hurt as well, which is new.

Sometimes when I get really anxious I also start shaking really badly and feeling pins and needles in my face and hands (this doesn't happen very often, but it has happened before so I thought I'd mention it). I don't know if this is an anxiety attack though because I can still talk/text somewhat normally and it's not like I'm absolutely consumed by worrying, even though it's constantly in my head.

And at other times I find myself breathing weirdly because of this strange feeling in my chest, and it's like I can't sit still, so I have to shake my hands and I'll be restless.

For context, I have been told by a psychiatrist that I have OCD before, and I was on medication for a while, but right now it's not as bad and I find it somewhat manageable, though sometimes I still struggle with rumination. All of my physical compulsions seem to be gone for now, though.

I know a lot of this is characteristic of anxiety, but my brain keeps telling me it's not real and that I'm faking it for attention, and that I *want* to be like this, which isn't true, but it feels so real to me. And especially today I asked a friend if they also feel nauseous due to anxiety, and they said it's very, very common, especially in Gen Z, so now I feel like I'm making a big deal out of something that happens to everyone, but I still don't want to feel like this every day.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm really confused and would really like some advice, please. Should I see a psychiatrist about this?"
Anxiety,I’m getting help,[removed]
Anxiety,I’m convinced I have a brain tumor,i’m convinced. I haven’t been feeling the same. I feel like i’m not me. It almost feels like my brain isn’t the same. I’m so fucking scared i don’t want to die. My brain feels like it’s just not working. Idk what to do this won’t stop. I’m crying like all the time. Like i’ve been to lord of doctors but i still think i have one. The way i feel mentally is freaking me out. It feels like i’m losing my mind like i feel disconnected from myself. I’ve never felt like this before it’s driving me insane. I never feel happy anymore either. I’m always in such a weird state of mind. I cant relax. Why cant i just feel like me again. I’m so tired.
Anxiety,"does anyone get dizzy just walking half an hour ? i feel like everything i hold is super light, myself included, I can't focus and my anxiety goes up. I had blood test recently and there was nothing wrong, I just can't tell myself I have this disorder",
Anxiety,Anyone else?,"Hi there, I don’t know if what I’m dealing with is anxiety.. feed back appreciated. I often feel tense, on edge/restless, irritable, hot.. I know that’s anxiety. A symptom I have at random, no rhyme or reason is this body sensation. Sinking/going over a hill is something I read a lot but I don’t think this sensation is likewise. Maybe a little bit but my sensation is hard to explain. It’s a body rush. My body will feel faint. An empty/fading like sensation consumes me. Starts in the arms, up my chest and neck. I get hot, tense, sometimes I’ll have “impending doom”. These can happen multiple times a day or not at all. They last seconds. Sometimes if they’re more intense, my hearing goes muffled. It feels like if it lasted any longer I’d pass out or die. Anyone have this? No amount of breathing, ice or staying calm helps because they come on and leave so quickly."
Anxiety,Buspar (Buspirone) worth it?,"Anyone actually feel any affect from buspirone? I feel nothing from it, but I feel embarrassed saying that - like I’m making it up or something??"
Anxiety,Panic Betwixt Sleeping and Wakefulness,"Apologies for the title, I just wanted an excuse to use the word 'betwixt'. Also TRIGGER WARNING for people with a fear of death.

I've long dealt with GAD and Panic Disorder but there is an experience that I've had that doesn't quite fit in either category. 

It stems from my fear of dying/non-existent. I've had this fear for as long as I can remember. It used to manifest through the day along the lines of: realizing that I'm actually alive in this moment (a very lucid feeling), then realizing that one day I will die, and finally realizing the inescapable inevitability of the end of my own existence. This would send me into what I would now describe as a panic attack. 

This occurred throughout much of my childhood until around middle school when I began to understand the feeling as anxiety and started learning ways to cope with it. By highschool the daytime-dying-disasters had largely ceased but in their stead I began to experience a sort of ""night terror"". I put it in quotes because I don't know if that's actually what it is. To my mind, night terrors usually happen when you are asleep not in-between

Basically, it was much like the aforementioned daytime panic attacks except it would only occur as I was falling asleep (not while I was sleep nor before I fell asleep). I would also describe them as more intense but incredibly short. The entire episode being less than a minute. I also tend to panic run put of my room or curl up on the floor.

This has occurred with varying levels of frequency through my adult life getting worse when I'm experiencing more stress or GAD but sometimes happening seemingly at random. It's hard to curb or preempt because of how quickly and intensely it occurs; by the time I'm experiencing it's too late for distractions or rationalization.

I'm curious if anyone else has experience something similar to this and if so, that they might have some additional insight to share or coping mechanisms. 

TL;DR I used to have daytime panic attacks about dying/non-existence but they've transformed into these hyper-intense very brief ""night terrors"" and I am looking for anyone with shared experiences."
Anxiety,does anybody else live with a headache/brain fog/burry vision CONSTANTLY. like not even a moment's freedom?,"I have had this for about 6 years. I've really struggled with it. I thought it could've been a nerve damage issue from playing football, but I got an MRI and it was all clear. However I've been doing more reading and I've found something similarish can happen with anxiety however the doctors I have seen haven't really ever suggested it. Does anybody else experience this?"
Anxiety,How to get rid of overthinking,"I am 21 Male, I overthink about my future. I get stressed when I overthink about my future, and what they’ll think about me, my appearance, outfit, hairs. I am not able to try new things or interact with people. And my friends use/ditch me. So I am not able to make new friends or female friends specially. I expect a lot from everyone. I quit my part time job because of my college.

So please help me out."
Anxiety,why i tried to make such a promise?,"Years ago, I was trying to give up smoking but I could not. I was worrying about my health and I was also worrying that I was making christian God angry.

So, due to this stress, I tried to make a promise to christian God that I wont smoke again. I tried to ask for a non-specific punishment in case breaking the promise to ensure that I will never smoke again. I thought the fear of punishment will really help me give up smoking.

I gave up smoking but I smoked again because I missed it. I have lost my faith in christian God and now, I worry if other Gods accepted the punishment/deal.

I worry about a very bad and specific way of punishment. Something that I hadnt imagined when I tried to make the promise/punishment deal. What if other Gods got angry and considered that this way of punishment is a good way to be punished sincie I tried to ask for a non-specific punishment?

I regret tried to make that promise. I think I did not want to but I made the promise from fear and anxiety. I had full control of my words but i do not know why i made it. i was just trying to give up smoking.

do you think ocd is behind all this or not?"

Anxiety,Some advice on Propranolol,"Hey, I’ve been experiencing some bad mental and physical anxiety for a while now. I went to my GP there today and was prescribed Propranolol. I know it’s mainly used for blood pressure and to lower the heart rate. I’m really put off it due to it being a beta blocker, my family has a long history of heart conditions and although I’m fine, I’m worried incase it’s going to have a bad effect on me. As well as this, I have days where I barley eat and drink that much and I’m worried taking this is going to shoot my blood pressure way to low. Should I at least give it a go on a very small dosage and see how I get on? Any advice would be appreciated."

Anxiety,help. I'm going back to study abroad and I'm having extreme anxiety over it.,I've been away due to my mental health for 6 months. Now my studies start again. And tomorrow I'm going back to the country. I'm so anxious and nervous about it because my 2 first years there were horrible due to covid and certain people. I haven't felt comfortable in the city and its making me overwhelmed. I have a panic disorder and I'm scared it'll become worse. Any advice? I'm very panicky and I can already feel I'll feel lonely.
Anxiety,How do you handle mid-work-day anxiety?,"Lately, right about 11 am CST (I start work at 7:30) I get the strong urge to leave for the day. I see that clock, think of how long I still have to go, and it makes me jittery and nauseous. How do other people who experience this get themselves to calm down?"
Anxiety,I’m 19 and I I find it extremely hard to even try and talk to anyone. Better I should just die now.,"I don't know, I don't even know what to say here in all honesty. I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship. Not to mention I'm high-functioning autistic, so yeah there's that...

Anxiety,I cannot keep living like this,"Hi everyone. Coming down from a panic attack right now, and idk about you guys, but it’s always super emotional for me once I come back to Earth. I’m sobbing as I write this to you all right now. I just feel so weak. I have a four hour graduate school class on Fridays, and today was our first one. It was a four hour lecture and I was getting through it no problem, and then I ate a raspberry muffin and the raspberry tasted horrible. I described it as “poison” and stopped eating it. But, then I thought myself into a panic attack that I was going to go into anaphylactic shock. I have literally no food allergies, at all. I know that they can develop as you get older, but I literally just had raspberries two days ago. But in the moment, I totally forgot about that. I had to drive myself home to take my medicine because I didn’t bring it to school, and the entire ride I felt like I was high on something. Colors were vibrant and music sounded better, but it was just too much for me. I was still so escalated during the drive I truly don’t even remember getting home at this point. Came home, took my medicine, put on my noise cancelling headphones to listen to calming music, laid on the ground, and put a freezing cold ice pack on my chest to feel something. I am just so tired of living like this. I wish I could just brush stuff off but I cant. I can’t keep living like this."

Anxiety,Anxiety ramping up with semester about to start,"This past week has been a bit rougher than usual with my GAD and OCD, I think because my grad school semester is about to start up again. I’m halfway through the program so this is nothing new, but my wedding is steadily approaching (next April!) and I also work full time. I’m so worried about the stress and anxiety I will feel and if it’ll be too much! I know I’ll be able to handle it, but the anticipation is uncomfortable lol. Just needed to vent!! Good luck to everyone else out there about to start back at school!"
Anxiety,Health anxiety about my boyfriend-please help,"So in the past two weeks my boyfriend had 3 days ( not one after another) where he felt tired with no cause, meaning that he was sleeping as usual, he did not do anything out of the usual to justify the tiredness he has. He is not worried but today I was at work and he was at a MRI for his shoulder ( he has ongoing problems with it for many years because he used to lift heavy luggages when he was in college) and when we were talking while I was at work he seemed fine. I get home and he says he is tired.. I m asking him why and he says he doesn’t know but he was really chill about it. I panicked and I also slept 3 hours yesterday and had a rough today at work and couldn’t control my anxiety so good.. so I ended up telling him I am worried he has cancer because  tiredness without a cause is a symptom of cancer. That caused a full blown fight, him telling me he is fine and “ can’t I be tired????” And telling me that I want to make him a hypochondriac too. He doesn’t want to speak to me. I m so worried I want to cry. I don’t want him to die or have cancer but I am so so worried I can’t control myself. Please tell me something. I am losing my mind. He refuses to tell me
Something to calm down, he s very angry I mentioned cancer out of nowhere and I know I made a mistake but I couldn’t control my fear in that moment. Thoughts? He says he doesn’t feel anything bad and he feels normal and I m the only one who worries."
Anxiety,Not sure what’s going on with me…,"Alright, so I’m not even sure where to start here. I’m a 25-year old male, around 176lbs. About two weeks ago, I noticed a weird change in my vision. I was seeing these weird bright spots in my vision that looked like shimmering lines or bright shimmery patches. It was especially worse when I was looking at a bright screen or a bright colored wall or something like that. The best way I can describe it, is when I looked down at my phone and saw black text on a white background, I could see little shimmering lines between the text that would make it hard for my eyes to focus. 

This triggered some pretty bad anxiety for me and I had trouble sleeping because I was worried about having a stroke or MS or something like that. I scheduled an appointment with an optometrist, and I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor to see some blood work results a few days after that. The optometrist said my eyes were perfect and thought it could be because of eye strain or my  lack of sleep. My doctor said my blood work came back normal. 

I will say, my eyes have improved since they originally started acting up, however now I have a whole new set of symptoms that are scaring the shit out of me. 

About a week ago, I started getting real dizzy (spinning room) and feeling off balance. I thought these were just spells but it’s been a week, and while I don’t feel “room-spinning dizzy” that much anymore like I did before, I always feel off-balance. It’s such a scary feeling because I’ve never felt anything like this. This has also made my lack of sleep worse, because everyday I wake up, I think, I hope my balance is back to normal, but so far it hasn’t been. It constantly feels like I’m walking on a tight rope, but it’s not bad enough to make me fall, it’s just so uncomfortable because I know it isn’t how I usually feel.

So this brings me to last night. I was trying to calm my anxiety by telling myself this is all anxiety/lack of sleep related. So I told myself last night, I was gonna get in bed at a decent time and get a full 8 hours of sleep so I can see how much better I feel. However, when I tried to sleep even though I was tired, I kept having these weird sensations that seem to match the symptoms of “hyptic jerks”. When I would start to doze off, and I was in that middle ground between sleep and awake. My entire body would feel so weak and jolted, and it was like I couldn’t breathe for a second. This happened several times so then I was just forced to stay awake, and I feel this triggered some panic in me. I so badly wanted to get a good night sleep but instead I constantly woke up all night with the most interrupted sleep ever. Now, I’m at work, and I notice I’m still off-balance and just don’t feel like myself.

I guess I’m just afraid that this will never resolve and I’ll never go back to feeling normal. I can’t stop fearing that, and it makes me feel like I’m going crazy. I feel like I’m losing my mind with all of this. I’ve had panic attacks and anxiety before, but these symptoms have been going on for about two full weeks now, and I can’t seem to get good sleep or feel like myself anymore. I’m just scared, and I want to feel like myself again. Can anybody relate to this or have any suggestions? Anything is appreciated! Thank you!"
Anxiety,CBD,Has anyone here tried @health_anxiety Purity CBD?
Anxiety,I keep searching for imperfections in my apartment,"Every single crack, stain, and flaw in my apartment I have memorized in my brain. Especially when it comes to walls, floors and other surfaces that can't easily be replaced. Knowing they're there bothers me so much. Sometimes I walk around with the lights off so I don't have so see them! I know it's ridiculous but the anxiety is so strong.


The damages that were already here when I moved in are easier to accept because they're beyond my control, but the damages I've caused myself are the worst. Today i accidentally squirted hand sanitizer on the wall and from some angles you can see the trail it left behind. It made me so anxious I felt like fainting!


Is anyone else like this and is there anything I can do to stop this behaviour?"
Anxiety,Almost an hour late for work 🥲 the manager was cool about it but I’m so anxious that someone might be upset with me,"I’m doing Instawork. I picked up a shift at a business I really like and have had a good experience with. I even had to speak up to a coworker for the first time which was awkward but ended well. We’re cool now. 


Anyways, I picked up a shift ~1hr before it started, called to let them know I might be late because of this, called an Uber and had the stop at the store so I could get a dress code shirt.  

My Uber was iffy about stopping at the store because he had a promo he wanted to catch (which I totally understand as a former Uber driver) 

The thing is, he left me there and took my work shoes with him 😅😳

I called the job again and my manager was flabbergasted but again, cool about it. 

I just hope everything is okay when he realizes what I mean by “later than I said before” 😅🙏"
Anxiety,“I don’t prescribe benzos.”,"I’ve suffered from anxiety for a good half of my life and have been on what feels like every medication under the sun. I’ve done therapy. I’ve been to inpatient psych wards multiple times. I attempted suicide as a scream for help. 

And it just pisses me off that all doctors seem to think people are drug seekers. So instead of prescribing a benzo that I know will stop my panic attacks quickly, I get antipsychotics that keep me in bed for days and feel like my blood is on fire- or an antidepressant that I need to take for 6 weeks to feel any benefit but makes me want to jump off a bridge within two days? 

Yes, I know benzos are addictive and have long term side effects but if my anxiety stays this bad there won’t be a long term! I’m going to die, life is not bearable when you have panic attacks every day. When you can hardly function what does it matter?"
Anxiety,Having a bit of a panic attack 23m looking for a guy to chat possibly to calm me down,
Anxiety,ADHD &amp; anxiety. Sensitive to weather &amp; change??,"Hey. I've never heard anyone else talk about this, so I feel like something's wrong with me.

Does anyone else here with ADHD (and/or autism) and anxiety get either very sad or very anxious with the slightest change of weather? Like, if it's getting a little dark outside around sunset, a weird feeling of sadness and discomfort crawl up on me. I feel like I was attached to the earlier hours in the day when it was sunny. 

Small changes like that can just make me feel so weird. 

And I don't know how to handle changes. I become homesick so easily on vacation, I can feel anxious if a friend's apartment looks some type of way, and I always crave the familiarity from everything I saw and felt during my childhood."
Anxiety,Constantly thinking about dying,"Hey, all! I am living my best life at college and having a great time aside from one REALLY ANNOYING thing: I am constantly having intrusive thoughts about how absolutely tragic it would be if I died. Every time I make a new friend or accomplish something or feel like my future is looking up, I suddenly think about how absolutely horrifying it would be if I died in an accident and how the people that care about me would mourn and how I wouldn’t be able to experience all these things that I’m looking forward to anymore because I’d be dead.

Sometimes these thoughts get a little more graphic, too; for example, I thought about sticking out my foot to catch a marimba that was rolling away and suddenly had this horribly gory image of my foot getting torn off sinew by sinew and I imagined the pain and how this would affect my life and how terrified my parents would be.

Basically, this is becoming really annoying and is getting in the way of me enjoying my life. I started taking a new anxiety medication a couple of months ago and it’s pushed down the mental panic aspect of my anxiety but I’m still getting the physical symptoms (e.g. excessive sweating, shaky limbs).

Should I ask to meet with my psychiatrist to see what she has to say about all this or should I just try and hold on for a little longer while I settle into the swing of things? It is still only the first week of classes, but I’ve been here for over a week because of marching band (the grind never stops).

(I don’t even know why I’m posting this here tbh, I’m obviously going to be meeting with my psychiatrist. Maybe I’m just looking for advice on how to deal with intrusive thoughts? Google hasn’t been very helpful in this regard because all I’m finding are results for dealing with violent or sexual thoughts.)"
Anxiety,Emergency Clonazepam Advice-Please Help,"Hi guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on a Clonazepam taper for nine months now I think. Going from 1mg for 3 months to .75 for 3 months, then .5 for 3 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

My primary care physician is an absolute nightmare. She says (through her nurse, I never get to talk to her directly apart from appointments) that my oral swab drug tests are inconsistent and some show me testing negative for everything so she thinks I'm not taking the meds.   


Long story short she's sending 5 days worth into the pharmacy and based on my upcoming results she might cut me off completely.   


How would you spread that 5 days worth out? I've already split my remaining 2 days in half so I'm taking .25 daily. Keep doing that? I'm scared to come off completely because it was the only med that ever worked for me.  


Is my dose so small that I could just stop any time? Any advice would be appreciated."

Anxiety,Anxiety’s physical symptoms ruining my life,"I have diagnosed general anxiety disorder.

Every time I leave my house to go somewhere I have to make sure I go to the loo and empty my stomach because every time I go out without doing so I will suffer from food poisoning type affects if you understand what I mean. I have to know if where I’m going has a toilet and if it doesn’t I have to turn down going. Because of this school is unbearable for me and none of the toilets there are private so I have many absences and my grades have been on a downward spiral. 

My anxiety used to affect my bladder in the same way but since December last year it has been my bowels instead. I have been in CAMHS for around 2 years and as I am nearly 18 I will be leaving. My therapist although well meaning does not help me at all and sounds uncomfortable when I talk to her about these issues. She just tells me to have a designated worry time and it will be fine.

I was prescribed sertraline to relieve my anxiety but it does absolutely nothing for me. During the weekends I take laxatives to make sure my bowels are cleared before school on the Monday and I will take an anti diarrhoea every day while I am at school and I fear I am permanently messing up my body but it is the only way I can go to school.

I feel so lost and alone and I just want to be a normal teenager and enjoy my last year of high school and be able to get a job.

Any advice is greatly appreciated"
Anxiety,"After nearly being assaulted a few months ago, dark parking lots are now my worst nightmare.","I don't think it helps that I'm a 5'2, 100 lb girl, either.

But seriously, does anyone else (especially if you're female) get really nervous when walking alone at night? Especially if it's in a dark and/or empty parking lot. I need to get this off my chest, especially after an incident that's still fresh in my mind.

At night, I really hate how dark the parking lot of my apartment complex, and it's close to the woods as well. There are pretty much no lights unless you go and park on the side of the street.

I've always been anxious wherever I go due to my small size, but it's really escalated since an incident a few months ago. I was taking a walk to a store around the corner, and a guy started following me. I know he was following me because originally he was on the other side of the street, smoking. But when I passed by, he didn't take his eyes off me even once. He crossed the street to where I was and started walking fast.

I managed to get away, but stuff like that sticks with you forever. Bottom line? Screw dark parking lots, and screw creeps like that. You better believe I carry pepper spray now wherever I go."
Anxiety,Health Anxiety getting out of control.,"TW - Cancer, medical issues, hospitals, panic attacks, claustrophobia 

I'm going to try my best to explain everything that I am currently feeling, and I'm hoping somebody feels the same and can help me out because school starts again in a week and I'm not sure if I will be able to succeed like this. 

For some background, I (25m) had never had a panic attack before the age of 20. In the summer of that year I came down with extremely severe Vertigo which caused me to lose most of my vision, as well as my ability to function on my own for about 2 months. I had to get multiple brain scans in MRI machines which terrified me and still scare me to this day.

At this point in my life, I was a pretty heavy weed smoker as well, and after I had recovered from vertigo, weed started giving me pretty incapacitating panic attacks. So I quit smoking, but the panic attacks stuck around. They got a bit better over the course of the next couple years and I hadn't had one in a long time up until recently. 

In July of this year, my dad was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. He doesn't smoke, eats healthy and exercises, and was probably in better health than me. While his prognosis is amazing and he will more than likely pull through, he is in extreme ammounts of pain, and has been in and out of the hospital for treatment and different complications. 

About a month after his initial diagnosis, I had my first panic attack in a long time. And then another one the next day, and now I have been having almost daily panic attacks surrounded by a constant state of anxiety. The first few weeks I was convinced all the stress was going to give me a heart attack, and I ended up getting myself into the hospital with chest pain to get my heart checked out. My heart is healthy and my blood pressure is only slightly above normal. 

After I got checked out, I had about a week and a half of releif with little to no symptoms of anxiety. This past weekend however I went on a vacation and ever since i returned, the panic attacks have been back in full swing. I am no longer concerned about my heart, but now I seem to be clinging to some diet related anxiety. I get scared I am either going into anaphylactic shock (I have a severe peanut allergy) even if I cook my own food and know exactly what's in it, or I am convinced I am falling into a diabetic attack. I have no history of diabetes, but It does run in my family. 

I can give more details if requested, but does anybody know how to deal with health anxiety? Specifically around food? I know I was completely fine eating around a different city and drinking alcohol while on my trip, but now that I'm home and back in my safe regular routine I am convinced somethings wrong :/. 

Currently I am surviving through: 
Daily meditation / mindfulness exercises 
Visits to a social worker offered through the cancer centre here in town 
1mg of Ativan as needed for when my panic attacks get out of control 

Thanks for reading and In advance for any help offered! Apologies for formatting as I am on mobile. 

TLDR; Ever since my dad got diagnosed with cancer, I have been having frequent health related panic attacks. Most are revolving around food. Any advice would be appreciated!"
Anxiety,How to treat my anxiety before work in morning?,"I often have had thoughts that I’ve had anxiety my whole life and I know I do. I have had a problem for a few days now that has never happened before. I started my first job and I have to wake up early, so now that I wake up early I get major anxiety. TMI but It’s to the point where I have diarrhea every morning and I throw up because I’m so anxious. I tell my mom and she says “we’ll get over it”. It hurts that family doesn’t even care and stuff. Is there any medication or anything I could take to get rid of these symptoms or anxiety?

Anxiety,Currently in the midst of another Panic Attack,"Having anxiety is terrible. One moment I’m fine the next there’s this deep feeling of impending doom although my mind knows that I’m okay my body refuses to believe it and goes into flight or fight mode. I’m feeling nauseated but I figured that the best way to beat this moment is to talk about it. I usually listen to calming music during times like this but I can’t sit still and just breathe. Being still is too overwhelming. I’ve had some major life changes occur over the past few months and little to no anxiety but as of lately it’s reared it’s head again. (I am also bipolar II) Sometimes I wish there was something I could do to just make this feeling go away immediately. I’ve tried medication, meditation, frequencies/sound therapy, breath work, and etc. but nothing prepares me from an attack. I know that I am okay, I know that the feeling is temporary but it feels like forever sometimes. I want to cry but it’s literally nothing to cry about. Sometimes I ask what is my anxiety trying to tell me. This time I think it’s trying to tell me that there’s something that is triggering me and making me feel unsafe or not in control. I have been off my bipolar meds successfully for about 7 months due to an allergic reaction i had. i took my first dose of a new med tonight. I think I have a deep fear of medications not because I feel like I don’t need them but because of all the bad experiences i’ve had. i don’t know if i want to continue taking it. although i know that it’s not directly the medication that’s causing the panic. i supposed it’s some form of ptsd im allergic to a lot of foods and meds and i usually find out through eating them or being prescribed a new medication. it’s scary and one of the many things that cause an attack (although there are times when attacks happen for no good reason) anyways thanks for coming to my tedtalk sorry for the long winded post"
Anxiety,I’m desperate to be back to my normal self,"For context I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I had a bad childhood. Two years ago I started taking Zoloft and steadily kept getting better. The past year I’ve felt more or less on cloud nine. Great boyfriend, roof over my head, getting an education, mostly happy. But the past couple months or so I’ve been spiraling. All the work I had done to overcome my anxiety is crumbling. I feel like I’m in high school again ( I was so anxious and depressed it was debilitating I never left my house). I’m literally turning to Reddit because I can’t talk to my therapist every day. I’m on my phone constantly and I can’t stop. I’m paranoid about everything imaginable. I think my bf is cheating on me without any good reason. I’m literally sitting in bed and my heart is racing.

Anxiety,How do I deal with my partner’s severe anxiety and panic attacks,"My boyfriend has been dealing with severe health anxiety and panic attacks for about 8 months. His health anxiety is so bad that we’ve been to clinics and hospitals at least 20 times in the last couple months but doctors just tell him it’s anxiety. He has a really hard time believing that it’s just anxiety but it’s understandable because he has symptoms and pains all the time. This also started happening about 6 months after he went through a traumatic event but we don’t really know if that caused it. He does have ptsd and some other mental health issues. 

Other than seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist how can I help him during these episodes? I try my best to comfort him and convince him that he’s gonna be okay but it’s so intense and he really feels like he’s going to die every time. It’s like every panic attack feels different for him but it’s always the same. I just want to help him ease the stress a bit but I really don’t know what to do. It’s also been really stressful for me as well because I’m the only person he can really lean on and I can’t let him go through this alone."

Anxiety,First Dentist Visit in 12 years - Anxious about how it went,"I suffer from generalised anxiety but today I did something I have put off for a very long time, I went back to the dentist. I have somewhat of a phobia of Dentists having had a very bad experience when young (drill/filling without anaesthetic age about 8, because I didn't like needles and it was not really explained to me what that would mean until...)

Anyway, I was hoping to find a dentist that would be friendly and understanding. I put on the notes that I have a dental phobia and I haven't been in a long time but I'm not proud of this and I really want to work together with a dentist to get back on track and regular visits. I went to my health insurer's dentist.

Started off ok with the dentist, he was asking about my phobia and I explained it was about the fact I hadn't been so long and that it had been dominating my thinking until now and that it was a big step for me to make this appointment and my fear is you're going to tell me all of them need to come out etc.

Anyway we get going, he does X-rays, looks at the teeth etc and then his opening statement is, well the good news is we don't have to take them all out. And then I'm thinking of this is potentially going to be quite a lot then :/ and he began to rattle the few off it was my wisdoms that I still have (which to be honest I completely expected would have to go as I know they are very hard to clean properly) and was explaining that.

So then we get talking on another topic and I said I'm really not proud of my smile and he asked why and I said because the teeth just are a bit gunky etc not pearly white and he said we can do something about that but I won't do that until I can see a commitment that you're going to come back more frequently than 12 years (fair enough, I kinda get this attitude to a degree). and he kept saying that a bit when talking about some other treatment.

He then said if you come every 12 years I'll have to shock you each time and I kept re-iterating that I want this to be a new dawn and to work together to fix this but I also understand right now this is just words. So it seemed like he went down a tough love path, which knocked my confidence a bit. He also said if I start flossing I might avoid some fillings, so again that seemed a bit weird (i get flossing, but if fillings are needed it's needed?)

Anyway just after this we had a discussion about the wisdom removal process and the dentist who would be doing the work came in and explained it and he said 'your other teeth are strong' which is obviously the opposite of the tough love bit. It seemed like the first dentist was going down a path of shocking me to come back more frequently (and I plan to anyway) whilst the second guy was a bit more encouraging. So I'm holding onto that comment.

Anyway despite this I feel really good that I've started on a path to try and get something resolved, something which has played on my mind for an extremely long time and has caused me mental anguish (the longer it went the more anguished I got). I get he's probably heard it all before from others that they will come more frequently and perhaps they don't, but I genuinely do want this to be a new dawn and am anxious about how I am now viewed by this dentist.

Need some thoughts and advice on this, please."

Anxiety,what to do about my director discriminating against my panic disorder,"I have a panic disorder and ever since covid it’s brought about agoraphobic issues and now that there’s a push for us to all go back into the office, I’ve been asking if I can have some workplace adjustments (working from home) so that I can ease back into travelling and going back into the office slowly and gradually. 

She made a big deal over this and escalated it to workplace relations and in a meeting with me and my direct manager she asked me why I wasn’t taking medication, she commented that seeing a psych once every 3-4 weeks wasn’t enough and she said i should see a psychiatrist because they’re more knowledgeable and “better than a psychologist”. I’m not on a executive salary like her so I can’t afford to see a psychiatrist and I genuinely feel like i am recovering but the chat I had with her made me cry pretty badly and now i feel so shit about myself and my recovery. 

Am i wrong for feeling this way? Is my director toxic? Every time i interact with her my anxiety flares up, and for the past few weeks ever since that incident, I’ve been avoiding meetings with her. Atm I don’t even want to rock up to work because I don’t want to interact with her. 

What should I do?"
Anxiety,Called The Ambulance For Panic Attack,"Last night I got extremely stressed out my heart was beating at around 90-100bpm, the ambulance came and checked my bpm which then shot up to 130bpm and stayed there for the next 20 minutes. I was explaining to the crew that it’s a panic attack but they weren’t listening to me, they did an ECG which came back normal then checked my blood pressure 3 times (174/90, 160/80 and 134/90) the cuff was really tight so I doubt they actually got accurate readings since one of the ambulance crew was using both hands to press it down onto my arm. After a bit my heart rate dropped into the 80-90bpm and occasionally went into the 100s. I decided against going to the ER since I felt better and I’m seeing my GP today. I don’t want them to increase my blood pressure medication since its my anxiety that is causing it to go up but I’m not sure what will happen."

Anxiety,Tips of overcoming pill anxiety,"Hi.

I need to take larger than normal pills (it's important) and I am now researching how to do it. I can't cut them, they need to be swallowed. I have major pill phobia. Whenever I try to swallow even a small pill, I gag or think it gets stuck and I'm suffocating. (I associate swallowing pills with hospitalisation or dying)

I never had a pill stuck in my throat, thank God but it happened that few pills took a loong time to go down and it felt as if they were stuck. Yes, this is a psychological issue and not a physical issue.

If I wasn't scared of swallowing pills, I wouldn't pay the slightest attention to how I'd take them. But I am very anxious and panic right before the time I need to take the pill (I even think about the pill weeks before I buy it).

The root cause of this issue might be that my own parents had the exact issue. One of them even chocked with pills and I saw that happening as a child. Hence, the fear. 

So, yes, it's in the family.

Please tell me if this phobia can be overcome. Also, please don't give classic advice of just taking the pill with a lot of water or apple sauce/yoghurt. It wouldn't work. I think taking the pill with water makes it even worse for me. Not sure why but, last time I took some pills, I had to use so much water for just one pill. If you flood your mouth/throat with water yet the pill still doesn't go down smoothly, then the problem is not the water. Right? 

I hope someone discovered a way to overcome this nasty phobia and shares it with me. Thanks."
Anxiety,Canceled a trip last minute due to anxiety,"A friend of mine is having a baby soon and invited me to visit at her house for a few days at the end of her summer vacation.

Today is the day I am supposed to do the 8 hour drive and I just can’t bring myself to do it. I feel terrible canceling at the last minute but the anxiety is too much. The reasons not to go are strongly outweighing any desire to go: I hate driving, the drive is too long, I don’t feel safe driving that far alone, and it’s too expensive in terms of fuel and travel insurance. My travel anxiety is just crippling. I wish I said no right away when I was first invited."

Anxiety,Hello. Would really appreciate the any support right now. Mom went to get a blood test and I’m convinced she has cancer.,"Mom has some blood tests she had to have done a while now but got busy and forgot about them. 

She’s been kinda nauseous lately and yesterday she got really scared after becoming lightheaded at work. She’s kinda hypochondriac, so she became a bit worried but wanted to remain calm around me. She got the tests done today and will get the results in the afternoon.  

She thinks it could be diabetes. Which im not really worried about, a lot of people in are family have it and leave good lives. We come from a family of heart conditions and problems and she already has blood pressure issues that she takes medication for. It’s the fact that jt could be something worse.

What if they find cancer. Im already predicting all the treatment and stuff, what to do with the dogs, will she survive if she has it, etc.

Im really freaking out. Need help calming down"

The hairdresser has a  seriously laid back/relaxed personality though which I think has really helped more than she realises! I normally have panic attacks but no panic attacks so far, just some anxiety. But I’ll take that over a severe panic attack.

I've been sexually assaulted/harassed, stalked, cornered into uncomfortable situations, treated poorly, and used enough times in my 30 years of life now that I just can't find it in me to trust men anymore. 

This has obviously been an issue in the past, but I didn't realize how big of an issue it would become.

I have my first ever male boss at my new job. I didn't realize all my other bosses had been women until I started wondering why I have such a hard time going to my new one. Then I realized... because I'm afraid of him.

He's a good guy. He is incredibly understanding. He has never done or said anything to suggest that he would be anything else. Yet somehow, no matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to trust him. I have such a hard time talking to him that I get physically sick (*sweating, nauseous, having to go to the bathroom a lot*) before our one-on-one meetings, because I have IBS that is worsened by anxiety. **Every time**. I went home the first couple times before I realized it was just my anxiety and not me actually being sick. 

I had it really bad one day. I went to go give him an update on something we had previously discussed and I must have stood outside his office door for ten minutes straight, unable to make myself move forward, physically shaking.

I've paced back and forth getting with in 5 feet of his door and then turning around and repeating that about seven times just about every time I've tried to go to him for literally anything. (The exception being when I'm helping a guest, because so far my will to help those who come to our office can overpower my fear if it's a situation *requiring* me to ask him what exactly needs to be done.)

I don't want this to effect my job more than it already does. I don't what him to find out in case he thinks it'll become too problematic or something. I just... I have no idea what to do or if there's anything I *can* do.

But if you read all of that, thank you. I just need to let that out somehow, and this seemed like a good place to do it. I hate keeping this inside, only really being able to talk about it with my therapist. It weighs on me quite a bit."
Anxiety,How can I stop worrying about someone else's issues and struggles?,"Hello! I am 18F and I have an issue with worrying too much about what other people are going through. I have anxiety and am generally a very sensitive person. 

Today, I was talking to someone on Tumblr, I know them since we both write fanfiction for the same character, but this was the first time I talked to them. I was basically coming out about a certain opinion I had regarding the fandom we were in, and they answered to me privately saying that they understand how I feel and that they are in a tough spot in their life that is ""literally rock bottom.""

I always get anxious when someone comes forward about their struggle, especially when it is mental health related since I have, in the past, had a traumatic experience regarding it. So now I am struggling internally with unwanted thoughts and my mind forcing me to do something I don't want to do. I am now worried that maybe they are depressed and might kill themselves, or maybe they are seriously sick. Since they were ambiguous about their issue, there is this voice in my head trying to force me to ask them about their issue, saying if I don't do it something even more bad will happen. But I am fighting against it saying it's a personal question and I shouldn't poke into their personal business. But also because of this, I am in a constant state of anxiety, worrying about whatever issue they are going through, and hoping it isn't too serious. 

I feel ridiculous for feeling this way because they are a person I began to talk to today and I don't know them personally or in real life. But I just can't stop worrying about whether they will be fine or not. The basic fear is that one day they might randomly message me and tell me they are going to kill themselves or die, which relates to the traumatic experience I referenced earlier. I fear they might end up dying. 

I currently don't have anyone to talk to since my psychiatrist is not available at this moment. So I feel lonely and scared.

I just want advice on how I can overcome or lessen what I am experiencing now."
Anxiety,Is it appendicitis or am I just anxious?,"Yesterday morning I felt a small ache in my lower right abdomen near my pelvic. Not too much pain at all, but it did cause me to worry a lot. I began searching up symptoms of appendicitis and started having a really bad panic attack. The only symptom is that small ache. So I had my dad take me to the urgent care just to check and they said if the pain gets worse or I develop any other symptoms to go to the ER. Later I stopped worrying about and didn’t focus on it and the pain went away. But this morning I started thinking about it and the small ache came back. Now whats also really stressing me out is I’m getting a small ache in my right hip and right below my right rib. Im scared theres something seriously wrong with me and I’m on the verge of panicking. Can someone reassure me and give me advice?"
Anxiety,Anyone else feel like this?,Does anyone feel like they are losing their mind. Like nothing feels real i feel very detached from everything. Even tho I know it’s from anxiety and or stress it’s still kinda scaring me. Does anyone know how to help with this at all.
Anxiety,How meditation can change your life and get rid of anxiety,"The first time I tried meditation, couldn't do it.

I was 19 years old at the time.

And healthy to me was drinking orange juice after a long night of drinking alcohol.

I kept hearing about meditation and its benefits. So I sat down alone. I closed my eyes and all I got hit with was a huge wave of thoughts that I just couldn't sit with.

Maybe meditation isn't for me it just seemed like a waste of time. And honestly, I didn't feel like I needed it. Life was good. I was having fun and I didn't have much responsibilities, little did I know meditation would one day change my life and help me uncover emotions that were stored deep in my mind, but more on that later.

Two years passed and I hit 21.

My days of getting messed up at parties aren't as often, and I have a lot more responsibilities.

There's also this really incessant need to succeed, but not the inspiring kind, a need based in fear.

You see, I dropped out of college and now that all of my friends are starting to graduate, it seemed like everyone had their life figured out.

I am no longer, OKAY, with just having fun and enjoying the moment.

I have this tattoo on my arm that says enjoy now, which was ironic because that was the last thing I was doing.

I have a deep anxiety, a fear of failure, a need for everything to happen now.

Even though I try to be healthy, my mind can go out of control.

I've never been taught to manage my own stress and thoughts. I would often burn out and binge only to come back the next day and feel guilty for taking a break. I was trying to grind my way through life. I was gaining success in my business and I was able to go full time in videography in 2019, but like a lot of other people, I was neglecting my mind.

Working all day and drinking tons of caffeine starts to amp up my anxiety and I start to feel like I'm losing control.

While watching one of my favorite YouTubers, YesTheory, they mention meditation and how it has helped them control their anxiety. So I say, screw it. Let's give it another try.

**At the time I probably meditated once a week and it was unbearable. I didn't see the point in doing nothing when there was so much that had to be done.** Eventually I hang out with a friend who was also trying to get into meditation and he was like, yo, we should meditate together.

We sit down and we put on a 10 minute guided meditation. And for some reason it was a much more profound experience. The act of meditating with a friend with another human being, with another presence, gave me a sense of calm and peace that carried on throughout the whole day.

Finally, for the first time, I felt the benefits of meditation. I felt so good about it, that I ended up buying a meditation app. And this is what changed the game for me because I'm a frugal person, so when I spent $60 on a year subscription, best believe I'm getting my money's worth.

The infrequent once a week, meditation started to turn into five time a week meditations, and I started to understand the practice.

Let your thoughts pour in and then let them go slowly.

I was convinced that meditation was helping me, but let me be honest, during my first year, I would go weeks or months without having any amazing experiences like I did the first time. Those were far and few between it took a lot of discipline and willpower to keep on meditating, but eventually it did pay off one year later.

What used to seem impossible was now actually kind of easy. I could go 10 to 15 minutes without losing my mind. The benefits are subtle. It's like a muscle that you train over the course of a couple years, and it's something you have to practice frequently to keep. I noticed that I have a bit more anxiety when I haven't been meditating.

Just like I noticed I start to lose muscles when I haven't been working out. Whenever I'm in a bad mood or feel uncertain about something, meditation helps bring me back to myself. It helped me realize that a lot of my problems aren't actually that big of a deal that yeah, I have a lot going on, but no matter what everything is going to be alright

I started to feel more confident throughout the day. And I started to notice a sense of calm in my conversations with people. I could hold eye contact way longer.

All the times I saw people preaching the benefits of meditation, now started to make sense to me, when not too long ago it seemed like a complete waste of time.

I really started to amp up the meditations during quarantine. I was bored and I had so much free time that a routine was essential. 20 minutes a day, every day. This is when I had one of the most amazing experiences. It was eight months after my last breakup.

It wasn't until eight months later, when COVID happened that I actually dealt with what was going on. You see, I think that's what meditation does. It forces you to confront your own mind.

So one morning I'm meditating and I feel a deep sense of peace. Come over me. This happens like once or twice a month, you get a euphoria that is unexplainable. You just feel so damn good from nothing after the meditation.

And out of no where all the sad feelings from the break up resurfaced, and I started bawling. This was the first time I had really let myself feel sad about it, but afterwards it felt like a hundred pounds had been lifted from my shoulders.

I attribute this to meditation because I don't think those emotions would've surfaced. And I would've been able to let them go if I didn't have the space in my mind to do it.

And that made me realize as human beings, we hold onto things way longer than we think. And we leave them bottled up inside.

It's time to figure out who you truly are to take a step back from all the things going on in the world, because ultimately all your goals, everything you have and everything, you know, will be gone.

And the one thing you want to have figured out before your life ends is your self."

Anxiety,can stress really trigger a full body nervous system issue ?,"A few months ago, I was working out and hurt my back a little. (I have a history of sciatica, a microdiscetomy and chronic pain/herniated discs).. I'm 25. Anyway - proceeding this and potentially along side other life stressors - my body, my entire body from my face to my feet were having nerve pain? Misfiring? Tingling? .. this induced insomnia as I was terrified of going back into an acute flare of sciatic pain, and panick attacks (according to a counsellor I saw). This went on for about 2 months. I had MRIs completed, bloods etc and they all came back clear. The doctor then suggested an antidepressant and also is used for neutopathic pain - it completely zonked me for days. I took myself off it, and magically... the nerve pain was gone. The doctor had mentioned as there was no physical cause, that it was all emotional/mental health driven. My question  is - has anyone else ever had this?"
Anxiety,Anxiety over false asbestos exposure scare,"Back in October 2020, I helped a handy man gut out a Sunday school room, as part of a church hall. I broke up old ceiling tiles and fibreglass insulation and took it all out the back to into a tip. 

Fast forward to late January 2021 and I was doing some online learning, specifically health and safety. My tutor explained that’s there’s stuff in old building materials that, if you inhale the dust from said materials, it can give you cancer later in life, namely asbestos. 

I was in shock and horror after I found this out, as my mind raced back to the day in the church hall. 

I spoke to the man who I worked with. He doesn’t work with the stuff, and never would. The man I worked with, spoke with someone from the church who said there was no asbestos in the room we worked in. I also contacted someone from the church who said the entire church hall had been tested and came back safe. 

Despite all this reassurance, I still can’t shake this anxiety that they might be all wrong. 

It is bothering me, and given this is an anxiety subreddit, I felt it was appropriate to write this here. 

Thanks"
Anxiety,How can I stop worrying about my dumb 'rating' at my shitty job?,"i deliver groceries for an app for work rn cause i'm in school and it's decent

but because it's the modern gig economy hellscape, the way they evaluate you is letting customers rate how you did. it's a bullshit system cause you can't really control a lot of it -- like what orders you take, how well stocked stores are, them being dumbasses, etc. it's also a bullshit system because anything less than 5 stars is considered failure. out of 5. 

your average rating determines, overall, if you get fired or not if it gets too low. they've also decided that if it goes below 4.7 out of 5 (4.7, the number which is basically 5) you basically get worse jobs to do. 

it always fluctuates up and down because there's no real way to control it. the subs about it are toxic af because some people totally buy into it. 

it never really truly affects my income - i have the concrete numbers to look at and it truly doesn't.

it just makes me feel shitty about myself despite actively trying to not care. 

how can i stop caring?"
Anxiety,I am afraid I might be losing my mind from anxiety,"Please forgive my long post. 

&amp;#x200B;

**--history--**

Jan 1st 2020, after a few days of missing sleep and some stressful event. I started having these random panic attack throughout the day, prior to that I was a very chill person never had any anxiety issue or any health issue. For that week I started eating well, allocated 10 hours just for sleeping, and continue to exercise well. After a week the panic attack was gone, just some residue, but that slowly faded away too.

However ever since then, whenever I lack sleep for some times I would get a day where I have 1 - 2 anxiety rush (this happened rarely, maybe once every 5 months), and since the 2020 incident I learnt to control these rush, and they usually disappear within seconds.

(Anxiety rush: I feel it in my heart, my mind and hair on my body. Then the mind try to make sense of it by filling in the gap. When it is really strong, I usually run around to help the mind make sense of it,  it works well)

&amp;#x200B;

Since April 2020 , I started having a lot of health issue, developed some chronic issue, I still do and it's stresses me out to no end. I use to swim prior to Covid, but pool closes, so my only coping mechanisms was gone. However anxiety was never an issue, I was just stressed most of the time, to a point where I went from not a single gray hair to have people notice I have gray hairs.

&amp;#x200B;

**--turning point--**

Feb 2022, my chronic health issue gotten really bad, I started reading ""full catastrophe living"", really got into mindfulness, did it for a 3-4 months, got my chronic illness under control for the first time and calmed down my rushed mind. I stopped mindfulness afterward, because pool opened up and I went back to my swimming routine, and that made my chronic illness even better. **Life was going really well.**

&amp;#x200B;

**--Few bumps along the way--**

Afterward this year I had 3 incident where I took a nap and woke up feeling depressed and anxious (not the anxiety rush but just anxious all around), it normally goes away completely after I finish my swimming routine.

In June 2022 I heard marijuana might help with my stomach issue, tried it worked well first few times

June 19th 2022 - I overdose on marijuana, and for a week I was exactly how I was back in 2020 Jan, except I know how to control the panic attack, it also lasted for a week only, so it was very manageable.

&amp;#x200B;

**--my nightmare begins--**

July 7 2022 is when my real nightmare started. I took some med for my stomach health issue (pepcid), after a week I started feeling anxious for no reason (not the anxiety rush, but just anxious throughout the day. I quit the med but I am still getting the anxious feeling from time to time. My stomach issue also became worse than ever. I am not sleeping well

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a week and a half since I quit the med, my current state:

I get anxious about being anxious. I rarely get those anxiety rush, just a low grade anxiety but it's worse because this kind stay with me for a long time, while the anxiety rush would go away after the peek.

I am sleeping really poorly too because of my stomach health issue, I sometimes get woken up in the morning with racing heart too, but I am able to control it before it turn into a panic attack, and it doesn't make me jump up, I would just try to go back to sleep, usually fail though, but the poor sleep isnt helping my anxious feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is I feel like I am losing my mind, was so scared earlier. It got a bit better after I finally typed this out. I don't know if I will ever return back to ""normal"". The few incidents where I get this constant low grade anxious feeling is the worse. And I think I was scarred from it, because now I am anxious about that. 

I feel like it can be distracted though, so at least maybe it's not a physical/body chemical thing?? I am looking for a psychologist now.

I think I need encouragement/hug, and maybe someone to tell me it's going to be ok if that's possible and you mean it. Some advice would help too if that's ok.

I take 20 mg propranolol once in the morning for anxiety &amp; heartrate (I don't take it in the evenings because of the awful nightmares it gives me). I started it around a month and a half ago. One thing I noticed is that my veins are significantly more noticeable and more blue in color. 

I'm very pale so they were already visible to a degree, but the color is much more prominent. They're not darker, just... blue-er. Lol. Particularly in my wrists, hands, feet and chest. I'm always hydrated and due to health anxiety I'm afraid to look up reasons for visible veins. Are visible veins a side effect of beta blockers? Or are veins suddenly becoming more prominent a normal thing? I've never taken them before and I've never had this happen to me before."

I was in this restaurant, and not knowingly I pushed my hands to this chair (chair in the middle) to get up to pay the bill.

I didn't feel a poke or prick. I went out after I payed the bill. Then I realized what if there was a needle on that chair. When I came back approximately 50 seconds later, they already bussed the table clean.

Anxiety,Will seeking treatment for my anxiety help me stop lying?,"I have severe anxiety that stems from insecurities. It’s to the point where I’m constantly trying to control how others view me out of fear they reject me if they knew the truth. It’s led to massive problems in my marriage. 

Ive tried just being honest and sitting with that uncomfortable feeling but sometimes it physically feels too painful. Especially when the outcome of the truth ends up being my fears coming true. 

I also have ADHD so I’m hyper sensitive to criticism as it is. 

Every time I lie now it actually makes my anxiety and insecurities so much worse. I hate that I’m like this. I’m desperate to break out of this cycle.

Anxiety,DAE sometimes feel like they are going crazy when in that half sleep/half awake state before sleeping?,"So for the past year, I have sometimes found myself going crazy when I was trying to sleep. For example, last night, while I was lying in bed, one half of my mind was convinced that I was at my job and that I had some tasks to do even though I was in my bed, so I felt stressed and panicky because of the imaginary tasks I had to do. The problem is that it was not somnambulism because a part of me knew I was in bed and that my mind was messing with me, so because of that, I started panicking even more because I thought I was going crazy, resulting in even more panic and even shaking/weak legs.

I obviously struggled to sleep after that because it felt like I was losing it and going crazy. I finally managed to sleep but now this morning I'm still feeling really anxious because I'm scared that my mind starts doing that again and that I might go crazy.

I have no clue if this could be anxiety-related or something else, but if anyone can relate to a certain degree, feel free to comment:)"

taking over the insurance payment soon, but I am nowhere near done paying off the car. 
Me and my partner have been planning a trip to Texas to see his family for months now. However, we didn’t have enough for airplane tickets, so we settled on a road trip. The reason I have no idea how or want to go about telling my parents is because they freak out over anything I do with the car. Accidentally leave the car messy? I apparently don’t give a shit about it. Something messes up on the car? It’s clearly my fault because I obviously messed up the car because I don’t care about it. 
Me and my partner work almost over 40 hours a week each. Excuse us for not keeping our car spotless or running perfectly. We hardly have time to do anything we actually want to do in our schedules. But we always make sure to get gas, and take care of any problems that appear as soon and as best we can. But nothing is ever enough for them. They also constantly be little my boyfriend and act like he can’t do anything, even though he drives more out of the two of us, is a mechanic, a cook, an editor, and the list goes on. They know we’ve driven an hour away before, but I just know they are going to freak out the moment I tell them we’re going across multiple state lines with a car they barely even trust me with. I can’t stop stressing about it, and the date for the trip keeps getting closer. I’ve been so anxious over this entire trip and planning and having to deal with my family.

Anxiety,Wanted to give a reminder and say thanks. Don’t go off your meds without talking to your doc and having a plan. I went off my meds and am now suffering to get back on them. Just waiting for the Prozac to kick in.,"Hello everyone. 
First off I wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub. I’ve been reading through this all morning and just knowing there are so many people out there feeling the same thing as I definitely helps me not feel like such a weirdo. 

I’ve got GAD, depression, with some ocd mixed in there. At least that’s what my dr. Has said. I personally think it’s more that I have GAD and everything else is a symptom. 

The GAD makes me double and triple check things to try and prevent the anxious questions later about whether I locked the door, turned the coffee maker off, unplugged the iron. 

The fact that I’m always anxious makes me hate myself and wonder why I’m like this. Which of course leads to the depression/self loathing. 

Recently I decided to try and taper down my meds. I’ve was on a pretty high dose of Prozac and brought it down to twenty. Bought I was doing ok so I started to taper off. Then the full blown panic attacks started. 
Now I’m pretty sure I’m going to have to take the rest of the week off and sit on the couch trying to ride out these waves of adrenaline coursing through my body. 

I went to the urgent clinic yesterday and they gave me some Xanax. Which has definitely improved things. I’m no longer alternating between manically pacing the house, trying to not scream/cry on the couch, or shitting myself. 

Luckily I’m in a position in my life where I can take some time to get back to baseline. 

One piece of advice I wanted to give was how I explained it to my SO. She had a hard time understanding the issue. I’m ex military and she knows I’ve been in some high stress situations. But the anxiety developed well after my enlistment. How I think I finally explained it to her was it’s almost like my body/mind seem addicted to the adrenaline flight/fight response. So it just floods my system all the time every day. But there’s no reason for it. So I begin searching my memories for something I might have screwed up or not done absolutely perfectly to justify the feeling. Then if I find something that might’ve been incorrect I focus on it forever or until I can verify it’s correct. (Weird writing this as I can feel myself trying to think of an example. But also not think of an example so I don’t work myself up.) I think that really helped her understand it. 
Anyway. Thanks for listening to my rambling and thanks for all your posts and advice. It’s so very comforting knowing I’m not alone in this."
Anxiety,It wasn't my fault,"I feel so relieved right now I could cry.

I ran out of my meds 2 weeks ago and went to get a refill. My pharmacy said I had none left. But I could have sworn I had just gotten a new prescription. I questioned myself, is my sense of time that distorted? Am I crazy?

Cue 2 weeks of absolute hell from withdrawal in the middle of a move and a new puppy. 

I was beating myself up so hard. I fucked up. I failed. I caused this. It was all my fault. 

Doc has been on vacation so getting in contact and getting this all sorted has been at a standstill until today. Turns out, I didn't fuck up. I had just seen my doc and gotten a new prescription like I had thought, but there was an issue with it getting from the doc's office to the pharmacy. I should have refills until December.

I didn't cause this. It wasn't my fault. I was carrying all this guilt and shame and it feels like an enormous weight has been lifted. Plus, I'm finally getting my meds. I don't have the words express just how relieved I am."
Anxiety,Struggle,"Hello,

So I grew up being taught the beliefs that mental health is not real (military parent) but the more I am on my own I see how it is. The question I have is I don’t really understand what anxiety is. I have been diagnosed with pretty extreme adhd but I am starting to wonder if I have anxiety. There are very consistent times that I think there is someone behind or watching me or whatever that just like freezes me in fear. I also overthinking to the point where it is unhealthy. I can only think about worst case scenarios in all aspects of life. I feel like I live my life in a constant state of “what if”. Does it sound like I need to talk to a medical professional about anxiety or is my dad right and I just need to man up. No hate if that’s the case then that’s the case."
Anxiety,I am panicking about a choice I made,"Heya,

I’m currently 22 and recently about to travel to a university abroad. I need to take an ACT exam to enter there (as it is one of their requirements) to enter a Med School. I’m fairly well but I have frequent panic attacks when I struggle at something and I think It’s stemming from the trauma I’ve experienced during school as a kid (teachers were racist towards me and me think I’m stupid) so that really screwed up with me until recently I decided to travel to study and learn about orthopedics but I don’t know why I keep panicking despite me being comfortable with the choice I made."
Anxiety,Feeing really overwhelmed with weddings and social stuff coming up,"30M - as the title says, I’m currently feeling super overwhelmed. I have three weddings coming up this weekend alone. I just came back from one on Sunday. Now my wife’s family is coming over from today until Saturday and I pretty much hate my wife’s brother. All of this is making me feel alienated and driving my anxiety through the roof. 

On top of this I’m busy at work and now just sick and tired of so much socializing. I have no idea what to do."
Anxiety,Exam Results Anxiety,"(Tw?)

Hi everyone, how do you deal with knowing exam results will be released soon.

I already know I have a problem of attaching my worth to exams. I am aware of this but can’t stop it.

I couldn’t sleep last night, I was shivering (even though it was a warm night). My hands were shaking. I was binge eating.

Today - I can’t eat. I can’t move. I couldn’t focus at work. 

Results are released tomorrow but I feel like I can’t move from this one spot of the sofa (also found it hard to get out of bed this morning) until then. 

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

P.s. I have been on Sertraline for 6 months.

Thank you."
Anxiety,Does anyone else have seemingly allergic reactions after a day with more stress than usual?,"I’ve noticed that on days when I’m really anxious and high-strung that I feel tingling at the back of my mouth, it feels like my body is buzzing/vibrating, my nose closes up, and although I’m actually breathing just fine through my mouth, I get overwhelming anxiety sensations in my chest. They feel like allergy attacks, even close to anaphylaxis without any hives or actual visible swelling.

Usually happens 1-3 hours after eating on high stress days.

Anyone else?"
Anxiety,Reaching a breaking point,"So I’ve been back on my Zoloft for going into my 3rd week.. and it’s going bad right now… in the second week I was feeling better.. but now I just feel like I’m loosing… my anxiety is so high… I feel so clouded.. my neck feels like I have a bowling ball attached to it.. I feel like something wrong in my head… my sleep
Has been shotty.. I have sleep apnea.. but I haven’t used my machine in a long time… last night wile falling asleep.. I had my Pulse ox on and it read 88%.. so I know that’s an issue… I’m so emotionally and physically drained right now.."
Anxiety,"Had to go to the courthouse for Jury Summons, and felt like I had a panic attack every step of the way.","I missed Jury Summons twice because I was afraid to even open the letter. Now I had to physically go to the courthouse. 

I hate driving when I don't know where I'm going, court opens at 8 am, I live 12 minutes away, so naturally, I left at 7:00AM. Missed my exit, had to drive around in loops. Got really freaked out on the one ways so pulled over to a side street to re-orientate myself and calm down. Realized I was on the wrong side, had to do 3 more loops to find parking. The lot only takes cash, I don't carry cash, had to find street parking. Heart is just pounding in my ears. Brain is not functioning like a normal freaking person. 

Once I finally did find parking, I was still unsure I was in the right place. Paid for 2 hours time because I had no idea how long I would be there. Sat in my car for like 10 minutes to breathe and chill out. Felt like everyone was staring at me and thinking I was stupid and crazy. 

Walked up to the courthouse, security tells me,  ""read the sign, it's not 8 yet, get in line"". Go to the back of the line. I'm practically shaking at this point. Another security guy asked if I was a juror, said ""you're not supposed to wait in line, you need to go in. Where's your paper?"" My heart is just going nuts while I'm digging through my bag. 

Welp. I forgot the stupid paper. Panic rises even more. He tells me good luck with that. I go in, check in, get a little turned around but make it to the 12th floor. Get in line. Get called up. Face is beet red and I'm sure I look insane. 

""No Jury service today Ma'am, we don't have any active cases. Dismissed. You're good until 2024."" 

Hands me a paper and boots me. 

All that unnecessary, irrational panic, for a 2 minute conversation. 

I hate anxiety."
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"I am trying to find out if what I have is clear cut anxiety, or possibly something else.

I have no feeling of concern or worry when going out or attending social events, as rare as they may be these days.
Mentally I am 100% ready to head out to get things done.

Eager to get things done, due to how annoying this problem is.

However, nearly every time I get ready to leave the house I start to sweat…to the point where I can no longer leave the house and have to change my clothes/jump in the shower.

It is this physiological affect, turning red and dripping with sweat, that then leads to anxiety.
Due to obviously not wanting to be in public sweating like a boiled ham. 
However prior to getting my shoes on and stepping past my front door there is no sign of anxiety or concern about being in public.

It isn’t a heat thing either.

It seems clear it must be a subconscious mental condition.
But is it just anxiety?.
Does it manifest in a way that only presents itself without myself even being aware I have anxiety?.


Also if it is, are their any tips to make this less of a problem?."
Anxiety,"Does anyone else sometimes find comfort in knowing this all comes to an end, for everyone? Might be a trigger for some so be warned.","So basically, anxiety has taken a huge role in my life and used to totally control it. I’d be fretting about whatever it was day in and day out. Eventually, after a particularly bad attack, I kind of had a long introspection about myself and realized everyone, no matter what choices they make, doesn’t make it off earth alive. I know it sounds obvious, but for me it was somewhat eye opening that no matter what I do, it’ll end the same way as everyone else. Now when an attack happens, and believe me it still does, it is almost a sobering prayer to acknowledge my own fleeting mortality. I’m kinda posting this to ask if you guys think this is healthy because at glance it could be taken wrong."
Anxiety,(27F) Feeling helpless not being able to help my friend (30F),"Hello!

I am currently having anxiety (wanting to tear up) in regards to my roommate/friend. I have had this type of anxiety previously with this situation and I just want suggestions or advice to help reduce it.

Basically she's not doing good, is sad/depressed and doesn't want to talk about it. I think I've  done all I can, make sure she has resources available if needed (eg. distress center line, offering to drive her anywhere if needed). 

I had some catastrophizing assuming everything is my fault she has reassured me it's not and it's personal, but I still feel so helpless not being able to help someone especially someone who is not doing good that's so close physically. She is my first roommate apart from my common-law partner. 

It's hard not to be anxious when someone around me is not doing good. 

I also wanna reduce my anxiety to not add on to her stress/problems because she feels bad for making me worry. Which I have said not to be sorry, I just care."
Anxiety,Irregual heart beat,"So I just got out er.  I'll be earing a heart monitor for 72 hours soon but doctors arent concerned.  Ecg showed an early beat but otherwise a regural symetrical pulse etc.

It started with me measuring my blood pressure this morning that showed irregural heartbeat.  I've had that before but I always did 40 more takes and couldn't duplicate it so I wrote it off.

I had a medical a few weeks ago dr said my heart sounds fine 

Now I'm home freaking out.  I have terrible health anxiety and hypochondria so this is a nightmare 

Every time I take my blood pressure it shows irregual heartbeat symbol.  I can't stop thinking about it.  My daughter wants to play with daddy but I'm feeling in a constant state of panic ( probably why my heartbeat is irregual....)  I don't know how to stop."
Anxiety,"does anyone else feel a generally increased anxiety, lack of appetite and heavy/fatigued legs in the days after an anxiety/panic attack?","My level of anxiety is still much higher than it was before the attack.

Anxiety,How do I deal with relationship anxiety over my ex-girlfriend’s coworker who is pursuing her while we are trying to get back together?," **Background:** My ex and I were together for 4 years (last 2 years long-distance) and broke up seven months ago due to her severe depression and general issues with long-distance – her decision. She hates her life in her new city – she struggles with seasonal depression, doesn't have any friends, hates her job, etc. I recently had an opportunity to move near her. Since then, we have rekindled our relationship without the burdens of long-distance. She spends every day with me, helped me move in, has told her family/friends about me being back in her life, we've planned a two-week vacation, etc. We haven't put a label back on our relationship though because she wants to take it slow. Her reasoning for wanting to avoid labels for now is because she wants to fix a lot of her life that she feels dissatisfied by – going to therapy, working out, addressing long-neglected health issues, making other friends, cooking more, etc. Her depression robs her of functional hours she can do these things with, so she wants to still spend time with me in a way that makes her feel like she can still ""prioritize herself”

**Coworker:** After we broke up, a new coworker joined her office who was also new to the city. It’s clear that this guy is interested in her. They work for an airline so employees often travel together on weekends. He invites her to travel internationally with him alone every weekend, has asked her to work remotely with him for multiple weeks, texts her constantly, makes weird sexual comments to her, and I’ve noticed him making subtle back-hand comments about me to her that she didn’t pick up on.

I think she just genuinely appreciated having a friend here because of her loneliness, but there are a few things that make me feel a bit uncomfortable:

* She usually turns down his invitations to travel abroad, but she agreed to go on a week-long trip with him and a few coworkers, including other girls.
* She’s a pretty dry texter, tends to take a while to respond to me, doesn’t like long text conversations, and we don’t really update each other over text. She texts him frequently though, more enthusiastically, and they update each other on their days. My sister who knows her pretty well thinks she just texts this guy more because: (1) He’s new to her and less familiar, so she is putting on more of a “face” while texting him that she doesn’t have to do with me; (2) they almost entirely communicate over text while we see each other in person and FaceTime regularly; and (3) he was more present in her life until I moved here, so she would naturally text him more than me.
* Before I moved here, she invited him a couple of times to events that could definitely be conceived as dates – she told me she invited him because he was always available and she didn’t want to go alone. She also texted me afterward to tell me about the events and said she wished I was there.
* Her friends knew she had broken up with me, so when she started spending time with him, they thought she was flirting with him and was interested and made jokes about them getting together
* He understands her dissatisfaction with her job better than me, and I think I am a bit insecure because it seems like this is how every “emotional affair with coworker” story starts.

I haven’t necessarily spoken up about my discomfort, but she knows me well and can read my expression when she brings him up. I think to her credit, she has gone out of her way to give me assurances even though we aren’t officially together.

* She has explicitly told me that I have nothing to worry about with him, she just appreciates having a friend who is always down, but that she obviously chooses me over him and she’s not even sure if she genuinely likes him as a person or if they are friends out of convenience. That last part makes me feel weird, because she clearly enjoys talking to him and I don’t like that she’s downplaying her relationship with him to me.
* She talks shit about him a lot to me – but sometimes I feel like she uses that as a vehicle to talk about him with me in a less alarming way.
* She even went so far as to bring up his Instagram page to show me pictures of him so that I could see “that I have nothing to worry about” - I think the implication there was that he was unattractive.
* She also will unprompted tell me what they were texting about if I’m with her and he texts her – I have never asked her to do this and don’t ask questions, I think she just wants to make it clear to me that there isn’t anything there.
* She vented to me about how she hates that everyone assumes she is flirting/interested in him because they spend time together – she said even if he has feelings for her, she hates that she can’t just have a friend.

I have always been a trusting partner, and I try to be very clear that I support her being friends with this guy and don’t want her to feel uncomfortable about it. It’s not that I don’t trust her, but I don’t trust him at all (which is a first for me with any of her friends). But I don’t think I can express this to her while we aren’t together officially, and I don’t want her to feel like she has to lose the only friend she has to be with me – which is not my intention at all.

I’d just love any advice to clear my head about this – I know it’s something that I need to work on to fix my anxious attachment, and I’ve never been a jealous person but I do really feel concerned about him."

To be honest I'm just stressed and sad all the time and I don't know why. Usually this feeling last for a month or two but I've been having this feeling for quite awhile for too long I'd say.

Anxiety,Struggling lately,"Hello all. For the past 2.5 weeks or so I have been struggling really bad with my anxiety, panic and emetophobia. I take Prozac and have Xanax for when the panic gets really bad, but lately the Xanax is the only thing helping. My doctor first tried Wellbutrin but that just made everything worse. Then he prescribed me 1mg risperidone. I took one pill last night and it really scared me. I was basically a zombie, I couldn’t move quickly, I could barely focus on anything like my phone, and all of this terrified me and made me feel trapped. My doctor said to give it another shot at a smaller dose before we try something else, so I’m cutting it down to .25mg. But I’m still really scared to take it tonight. Does anyone have experiences with risperidone? Additionally, I am scared that these feelings won’t go away. I don’t know how many more days I can wake up feeling panicked and anxious. I’m so exhausted and worn out."
Anxiety,Completely messed up a work presentation/brief yesterday,"Throwaway account because I’m too embarrassed to even post this on my main; I’ll try to keep this brief.

20’s yo guy just started an entry level job in a corporate company.

I had to present a piece of work I did in a company teams call with about 25 people in the meeting. I’ve never really had public speaking issues before but something just snapped this time.

I was calm, cool and confident up until about 5 seconds after beginning to talk. Then all the sudden my voice gave out and started shaking. Not like a little quiver that people can ignore but a full on noticeable amount that you’d expect to hear from like a person who is being interviewed 5 minutes after a serious car wreck. 

I was even having involuntary sucking inhales like a kid will have when talking while sobbing.

In the middle of it I literally just stopped talking and stared blankly at my screen (camera was on so everyone could see). My face was flushed and I think I also started to noticeably tear up on camera.

What I needed to present literally took like 2 minutes but I wasn’t even making sense it was like a disjointed word salad that just literally made no sense. I just stopped talking and hoped the next presenter would start on their topic.

It was quite literally one of the most embarrassing moments of my life, I sat in my office unable to move for several hours after the call was over, needing to use the bathroom but too scared to even walk past the offices of some people who were in that meeting. 

I’m so fucking angry at myself as literally that same day I was talking with my boss (who was on that call later of course) and he asked me if I was ok with public presenting (since this would be my first time doing so at the company) and I acted all cool like it was no big deal.

I messaged him on teams after apologizing and saying that I lost my train of thought in the middle of it and I’ll do better. He said “we’ll send you to a remedial public speaking course next month lol”. I don’t even know if he was joking or not.

I don’t think it’s just my mind making it into a bigger deal than it was; it was actually really really, really bad.

I’m working from home today and I really can’t even imagine going into the office again tomorrow. I don’t even know what the point of this post was/is I just really needed to share."

Anxiety,Need advice &lt;3,"Hey! So I know reddit probably isn’t the best place to get advice on something but I figured it’s worth a shot 

TW: contains mentions of eating disorders

So I’ve always been a very anxious person but around 6 months ago I found out I have panic disorder, which for me is panic attacks that aren’t triggered by anything specific. Now theirs some things that trigger them such as needles for me, but for the most part it’s seemingly untriggered. However for a couple months now during/after meals I get extremely panicky and anxious. I originally thought it was just a coincidence but I’ve noticed that it’s around meals a lot so I assume it’s linked, but food and meals has never been a problem for me until now. We also have a family history of eating disorders, but so far that hasn’t affected me.

So my question is: what do you guys think this is? A coincidence? General food anxiety? Something linked to eating disorders? Any thoughts on it appreciated &lt;3"
Anxiety,Is it anxiety? Or something else?,"Okay, so I’ve had anxiety my entire life. Currently on lexapro daily and a benzo as needed for my symptoms. I’ve been getting these episodes and I have no idea if it’s anxiety or if it is something else. I’ll be sitting and my heart rate goes up, and I feel strange. It’s hard to explain but I feel faint and my hands are ice. I feel like my reaction time is slowed and my vision is weird. It also feels like when you are about to pass out and I feel shakey. I have a resting heart rate that is in the low 60s and when this happens my heart rate is in the 90s and it feels very uncomfortable. Usually it comes out of no where and it has no trigger. Currently dealing with this at work right now and am freaked out as I feel completely off. I’ve suspected I may have pots as this has been happening for a long time and when I take my benzo it doesn’t change how I am feeling. When usually with my anxiety the benzo stops it within a few minutes. So any ideas? Is this just anxiety and I don’t realize it?"

Anxiety,How can I stop my anxiety about someone else's issues and struggles?," Hello! I am 18F and I have an issue with worrying too much about what other people are going through. I have anxiety and am generally a very sensitive person.

Today, I was talking to someone on Tumblr, I know them since we both write fanfiction for the same character, but this was the first time I talked to them. I was basically coming out about a certain opinion I had regarding the fandom we were in, and they answered to me privately saying that they understand how I feel and that they are in a tough spot in their life that is ""literally rock bottom.""

I always get anxious when someone comes forward about their struggle, especially when it is mental health related since I have, in the past, had a traumatic experience regarding it. So now I am struggling internally with unwanted thoughts and my mind forcing me to do something I don't want to do. I am now worried that maybe they are depressed and might kill themselves, or maybe they are seriously sick. Since they were ambiguous about their issue (they later on did mention they were taking medicine and seeing therapist but that did little help to them so far), there is this voice in my head trying to force me to ask them about their issue, saying if I don't do it something even more bad will happen. But I am fighting against it saying it's a personal question and I shouldn't poke into their personal business. But also because of this, I am in a constant state of anxiety, worrying about whatever issue they are going through, and hoping it isn't too serious.

I feel ridiculous for feeling this way because they are a person I began to talk to today and I don't know them personally or in real life. But I just can't stop worrying about whether they will be fine or not. The basic fear is that one day they might randomly message me and tell me they are going to kill themselves or die, which relates to the traumatic experience I referenced earlier. I fear they might end up dying.

I physically don't feel good. I have constant butterflies in my stomach, and my chest burns. My heart rate is going up. I can't stop any of this, it keeps going. 

I currently don't have anyone to talk to since my psychiatrist is not available at this moment. So I feel lonely and scared.

I just want advice on how I can overcome or lessen what I am experiencing now."

Anxiety,I don’t know what is going on,"I’ll do my best to explain it. So I have anxiety and depression, I have been on lexapro for a month now and it has been doing wonders!

So the last week I’ve been having more anxiety than normal. (Near my period my anxiety always goes off the walls near my time of the month haha) and now today I feel like nothing. Like I feel so strange. It seems like I can’t really feel anything. Time is going so fast it’s already afternoon I feel like I just got up an hour ago. I feel out of reality if that makes sense. But it’s not derealization because I looked that up and I don’t have any of those signs of it. It probably doesn’t help I just got let go from my job (I don’t know why so that doesn’t help) and maybe having so many anxious days in a row my brain is just pooped and needs to recoup.

Anxiety,klonopin - long read,"I have been off of all medication for the better part of a decade, but spent most of my youth heavily medicated. I've been diagnosed with MDD, PTSD, GAD, insomnia, as well as some other comorbities. I stopped taking all of of my medication (on my own accord) because I felt like I was ""poisoning myself"" (obviously an anxiety thought.) I managed ""okay' up until recently. My anxiety became debilitating. I was unable to sleep, I was unable to sit still. I called out of work for what felt like heart attacksz aned i would lash out whenever my S/O tried to comfort me because I knew he wouldn't be able to. I was contemplating suicide every day... It hit a boiling point and I decided I needed to be medicated, at least for the anxiety. 

I was prescribed lamotragine, which I was on years ago but cannot remember how helpful it was. I was also prescribed 2 months worth of 1mg klonopin to take until the effects of lamotragine kick in .

Klonopin has been amazing. I feel like I have a totally new life. I feel like a person again, not just a vessel of anxiety. I'm able to not only work every day, but not dread working either. I'm able to sleep soundly every night without a million thoughts in my head. I am able to enjoy my life for the first time. 


I am so scared for the klonopin prescription to end, because I am so scared to lose this new found freedom. But I also know the many many negative effects of long term benzo use if I were to ask my doctor to stay on it. 


Basically, just looking for what you would do in my situation, and to find out if anyone else has done something similar with klonopin (taken it while waiting for another med to kick in) and felt okay afterwards.

I don't think I ever had this, and I didn't suspect it either. It doesn't hurt, no fever, no cough.
Is it bad? Is it dangerous if untreated? Apparently had it for about a month now. He gave me antibiotics for 3 days"
Anxiety,Worried about anxiety nausea/need help redirecting thoughts,"Triggers: death, vomiting
Hi, 
In short: I am worried about throwing up, never being able to keep food down, and eventually dying because of that.
A couple of months ago my grandpa died, which was the first time I have witnessed something like that. I have an anxiety/panic disorder, which was definitely triggered by that. 
A week ago I threw up when trying to eat. I had covid and I was anxious at the time. I have not thrown up since, and have been eating a little bit better, but I’m just worried about it all day. Am I going to throw up again? If I throw up again, I might throw up next time, and what if that leads to my death?
I need some tips to maybe calm the nausea and the thought, because it’s all I can think about. I’m so anxious, I’m just trembling all day. Thanks in advance!"
Anxiety,Can i be sacked for having anxiety?,"I am a sufferer with anxiety, so i've come to the people of reddit to help me out.

I work in a Carehome (as kitchen staff) and on Saturday (25th June), the fire alarm went off which sets me off. I did what i've been told to do which was come out of the kitchen and wait outside my door as that's where the fire assembly point is - while i'm trembling, hard of breathing with tears streaming down my face (this is how it goes for me, its unpleasant) its a false alarm as a leak set it off. Ive gone outside into the garden to calm myself and returned back to my work.  


About 10ish mins of returning i've been told ''you can be sacked for that'' 

Its played on my mind since the member of staff said that too me, the management know i'm a sufferer of anxiety and they know i'm petrified of alarms (its why when they do a test alarm they pre-warn me) I don't want to loose my job as i love it here.

Is it really true i can be sacked for anxiety ?"
Anxiety,I'm moving out. Need advice.,My parents mock me for my mental health issues and don't acknowledge that they are part of the problem. So I've decided to move out before I end up killing myself for real. I'm very dependent on them tho and I have no money and I have student loans. I have a full time job and trying to find a second one for extra income. Anyone have any tips for me to help me move out ASAP? Staying with other family members is not an option. My parents also don't know my plans.

Anxiety,I get anxious when my bf hangs out with other girls,"Hello, I am a trans woman(21) dating a cis male(21). We have been together for nearly 2 years and we've never had any major fights or disagreements. The problem is my own insecurities. 

My boyfriend likes to go to a lot of parties and group hangouts to smoke weed with his friends. I usually stay at home because i get stressed out in such a large group of people. Recently he's been hanging out with more female friends, and they always seem to just smoke weed and stay up late hanging out.

While he's out with them, i always end up having anxiety attacks at home. He's staying over at a girls house tonight because he got too high and tired to drive and im scared to death. I dont think my fear is justified because my boyfriends never done anything to break my trust in the past, i just cant help but be scared my bf will find one of those girls to be better gf material than i am.

My boyfriend doesnt know i have these freakouts because im ashamed of my emotions. Ive tried to calm myself down by drawing, gaming, smoking, knitting, but nothing seems to work at stopping the shakes and bellyaches. What should i do to resolve this?"
Anxiety,Ruminating/anxiety about past mistakes/thinking you’re a bad person,I’m wondering if anyone is going through the same thing or has tips on how to stop this.. I’ve always been anxious but in the past few weeks I’ve been obsessing over small details of my past and bad experiences I had (especially while going out and drinking) and I’ve been really anxious about it even if months or years has passed.. For example I always feel the need to confess every guy I kissed in the past before I was with my boyfriend and while we were sleeping together but both agreed we weren’t serious. Now that we are serious I would not and have never cheated and he knows every single detail of my life and is totally okay with every single thing and doesn’t care but I still obsessed over the fact and I find myself overthinking when he sleeps that I’m a bad person or whatever.. this is just a small example because honestly every small mistake I’ve made in the past I obsess over and I’m so tired of it. I just wish I could not care like everybody else. sorry if this chaotic I’m currently writing this while having an anxiety attack  like usual (every night) but please help
Anxiety,I’m having an anxiety attack,"It’s been happening for over a week or two. Been having chest pain/tightness and increased heart rate. I get scared. I feel like it’s going to kill me. I can’t calm down no matter what, as it’s a physical thing."
Anxiety,woke up in the middle of the night terrible anxious,"woke up in the middle of the night terribly anxious

hi its currently 2am here for me and i been rudely woken up by my anxiety. (i would like to preface that i am someone who has overcome an anxiety and panic attack disorder in the past when i was a lot younger so this isnt something new for me)
but anyway, i thought writing it out to get my mind off of this terrible attack and just have someone to talk to could help.

currently 2 family members of mine are sick with covid and i struggle heavily with health anxiety and i would label myself a germaphobe. it has been absolute hell for me this past week trying to keep things in order around the house, wiping things down constantly, trying to diligently keep my mask on whenever they are around, cooking for them, cleaning their rooms, constantly scrubbing my hands, etc… you get it. no other sickness has taken such a toll on my family like this and it is so utterly overwhelming.
i know its not their fault that they’re sick and i cant hire some sort of nurse to come over here and help them while i go run away. i just have the worst fear of catching covid even though i really been trying my best to keep everything absolutely spotless and only approach them from up close (with both our masks on) if i have to. im not sure if this is some sort of OCD thing or what but my god i just cant take it anymore.
ive really been holding it together for the last couple days and by the greatness of god i have not felt any symptoms only up until yesterday i got a terribly dry cough due to the amount of disinfectant sprays ive been spraying all over my room. i believe they irritated my throat pretty bad.
anyway, sorry for the rambling but i dont really have anyone to come to to vent about this and ive suppressed my feelings enough where i think it’s all just starting to crumble on top of me right now.
i cant stop my nervous shakes and my whole body feels like it’s giving up. my heart wont stop racing and i just cant come up with a single reason in the world to calm myself down :("
Anxiety,Does anyone else experience Anxiety symptoms like this?,"First time posting here so sorry if this isn't allowed. I've developed anxiety over the past year or two, starting from weed is what I believe. Getting ""too high"" and eventually experiencing anxiety when I'm not smoking. Over time it got worse and worse until finally I saw a doctor and was prescribed ""Lexapro"". It helped a lot until I ran out, been good with no panic attacks since my prescription ran out. But I've noticed I get this nausea feeling somewhat an end up just gagging out of no where but never actually vomiting? Was curious if anyone else has been through this and if it's from anxiety or being 1 month off of my Lexapro? or if maybe it's something I should see a doc about?"
Anxiety,Does 1 mg of Xanax make anyone else feel more anxiety?,"Second time taking Xanax to calm stomach muscle spasms. I took. 5 mg 3 nights ago, felt little effect. Tonjght I tried 1 mg and now am jittery and can't fall asleep. I honestly feel more like going to the gym and running except stomach hurts and I have had to stay off my knee due to some inflammation from overuse. 

Anyway.. Why I was prescribed Xanax.. 

I have a stomach issue a former Dr prescribed diazapam for as needed. It worked.. My actual Dr prescribed Xanax thinking  my stomach issue is anxiety related., and something about half life of Xanax compared to diazapam. But I was actually only taking half of what the other Dr prescribed to begin with, as needed when stomach issues came on (1 to 3 xs a month) and it worked fine. 

I definitely don't like the feeling of Xanax panic I am experiencing right now. 

Does anyone else feel more panic when taking Xanax for anxiety?

I will call Dr tomorrow and tell her it isn't helping. My stomach still hurts. And I still can't sleep."
Anxiety,Having a terrible time. Can’t shake my anxiety.,"Hi all. I have had anxiety for a long time. Recently it’s been really terrible. My dog died a month ago and since I haven’t been able to breathe or think. My grief is making my anxiety much worse. 
Today I was driving, or rather stopped at a red light. I heard a beep and then a car hit me from behind. Once the light turned green I went past the intersection where it was safe to pull over and got out my car.  
The people who hit me went to pull in behind me then took off. I got back in and followed them and pulled aside the very old lady in the passenger side. 
She rolled down her window and yelled “you reversed into me “ rolled up the window and they sped off. 
I was so upset and shaking I went to the nearest police station to report it. 
I now have worse anxiety than ever. Like I’m going to get in trouble I can’t stop shaking. 
I’m so sure they drove into me, I wasn’t in reverse but I’m starting to second guess. Surely if I reversed into them they would have pulled over?? I hate involving police and am paranoid I’m going to be arrested…. Although I’m pretty positive I didn’t do anything wrong. 
I can’t relax and can’t stop shaking. It’s been hours now. 
Does anyone have advice on stopping the over thinking and terrified feeling? 
Thank you for your time."
Anxiety,Living with anxiety is not living,"I have slept less than 5 hours tonight. I've woken up with the tachycardia I'm so used to.

I have spent 2 hours in bed trying to do the breathing exercises to try to reduce the discomfort. It hasn't helped much.

After those 2 hours, half an hour before connecting at work, I have taken a tranquilizer. It has helped me a little after a while, but not much. I keep feeling bad.

That was 3 hours ago. I've been awake for 5 hours, after only sleeping 5 tonight, and I have a whole day of work ahead of me. And it's Monday.

Every day is like this. Every week is like this.

Anxiety,afraid of tooth infection.,"so i have this cavity in a front tooth. (the right center) i started having it since around 3 years ago. no, it never caused tooth pain before but this year, it already began. and idk if it's just anxiety or what but my right nose was kind of like reacting to it as well. my family is really having financial problems so i can't see a dentist these days which is so frustrating.

i'm so so worried about that “tooth infection” and i don't wanna have one because **i just saw somewhere in the internet that it can reach our brains. internet really drives us (hypochondriacs) nuts.** i can't calm myself down. idk what to do. we are not financially stable and i'm just a student so obviously i don't have money.

Anxiety,I Have Anxiety About Sleep,"Hello fellow anxiety sufferers.

I have generalized anxiety but when it comes to sleep I am often unable to sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep the past week and I can’t take it any longer! I just worry so much about big things, small things, the past, the future, the present. Anything and everything. It’s like I can’t get my brain to just stop thinking and bringing up so many thoughts at once. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice? I have a bedtime routine that I follow and it was helping f for a while but doesn’t seem to help as much as it was. Other than that I’m not really sure what to do, but I know I need to sleep desperately."
Anxiety,Can someone help me?,"Might be the wrong sub for this but my anxiety disorder leaves me questioning myself a lot and I can’t tell whether this is a good idea to do or if I should just quit no forward planning. 

Toxic work environment, one individual just constantly trying to isolate me, can’t quite figure out why as she would rather rant about me to other people than say her problem with me. Anyways today I finally snapped and told her to leave me alone because all she did was either scream at me or give me dirty looks and today she screamed in front of a customer because I dropped a fork. 🥲

My question is, how do I let my supervisor know that I plan on quitting? I want to give him a heads up as he’s always been lovely to me and I feel as though if I don’t, said coworker will put a spin on it. I just want to send him a quick message just to say “I’m sorry but I’m really struggling with some things going on at work, and don’t really think I’ll be staying very long. Just wanted to let you know so it doesn’t come as a surprise.” but not sure if that’s enough or too much. 

Funny thing is I can usually deal with a mean customer, fake smile, fake apology (if appropriate), resume task. But when your middle aged coworker is gossiping about you, a teenager, it starts to kick in a bit when you’re standing alone and she’s standing smirking at you with her favourite people (i.e., the people she’s decided to like this month, changes every month.) do I tell my supervisor she’s the reason I’m leaving? Do I tell him what’s going on but not name names? 

I’m just tired of the anxiety feeling of looking over and seeing her staring at me and laughing. I feel like a joke and have since the day I started and I’m over it. It’s not ending, it’s not stopping, she’s well and truly won the battle and I just want out. I hate anxiety but I also dislike her for being such an mean human being."

Anxiety,Scared of not having a girlfriend," So for starters, this is a throwaway.

I'm 16 (17 in a week) and I have never had a girlfriend. I'm in an almost all-male secondary school. I hugged a girl once two years ago and that was the last time I had physical contact with a girl other than my family.

And I was never really scared of not having a girlfriend because I knew that when you meet the right person you know it. But now without any reason, my mind decided that I'm going to be alone my whole life. I'm overthinking and being anxious about this for like two weeks. And I recently cried myself to sleep for the first time ever because of this.

If I meet anyone I don't know what to talk about, I don't know how to start a conversation without being annoying, creepy, or pushy.

I don't get it how can everybody gets a girlfriend even the worst of guys but every time I see a girl I try not to look at her to not make her uncomfortable.

Anxiety,Fear of choking,"Hey guys, I have GAD and panic disorder but I’ve gotten used to it with time and can deal with it better generally.

I’ll so badly be thirsty and wanting to drink water or something but I have this fear I will forget how to swallow properly and choke, or it’ll go down the wrong pipe. Generally I just have to MAKE myself drink some water and try to eat a little bit and it’s almost nerve wracking but I feel accomplished after successfully not choking and in turn it kinda helps the anxiety.

Anxiety,I didn't think anxiety could do this,I've get nervous throughout the day. My skins burns and feels tingly at times. I wake up from vivid dreams.

I have ADHD but when I take my medicine it helps but as soon as I have pressure I fold. I, of course, notice anxiety in other parts of my life, I feel like I don't blank though, and when I mean blank it's like I'm not looking at the screen I'm not focused on the enemy or anything just very broad. I deal with my anxiety very well, for the most part, it's just this is the first time in my life taking video games seriously, and don't know if I should take medicine."
Anxiety,Going crazy with the amount of anxiety I am currently having.,"Sometimes it is so hard to explain everyone what goes inside my mind. It is surprising that I can maintain a facade that everything is normal in front of my family and then breakdown when I am alone. Certain people in my life give me so much anxiety and it has been a task for me to get out of the house without my body shaking in fear. I cannot concentrate on studying either and its painful that I cannot bring myself to do that; I end up doing nothing just mindless scrolls on social media and seeking instant gratification from a guy who is taken. That doesn't sound right I know, which piles more to my anxiety.

I just want to concentrate on studying and I don't know how to go about it. Please suggest something different from the googled responses as I have tried all of that but it doesn't work."

Anxiety,Anxiety,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to get my heart out. Hopefully it can be done here. 

&amp;#x200B;

For several years now, I have been severely affected by anxiety and depression. I have been in contact with this briefly in my younger years, but did not really get into trouble with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell you that for a number of years, I have been deep, very deep. I've had moments where I didn't even want to leave my room, where I didn't want to do anything. Moments where I wished I had a bad disease and at some point it would just be done. Really horrible. I never took any medication and never went to a doctor. I tried to crawl out of the valley on my own which I did reasonably well. Only sometimes I still suffer from memories or pain lapses. I then have bad dreams for a few days and find it hard to concentrate.

&amp;#x200B;

Being anxious and depressed is really awful. It affects the quality of life so much. My biggest fear is lying in my death bed later and thinking that I got so much more out of life. I have always been very motivated and sometimes set the bar abnormally high. I think a lot of the fears come from that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read a lot. Books like Atomic Habits, Good vibes good life. Those books have helped me a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, we really are a community. We help each other, share each other's stories and try to be there for each other. Never let this get lost! this is where people get to know each other, build friendships and get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy your day!"
Anxiety,Often mixing up words/aphasia due to anxiety? Help,"Hello, so I'm 29 and was diagnosed with general and social anxiety as a teen. I took a low dose of citalopram for a while and kinda ""got over it"" when I became older.

I'm still an anxious person though and it has become much worse in the past year, mainly due to to work and family-related stress. Not taking any medication though.

I've been experiencing speech problems quite often.  It's especially frequent when I'm talking to someone I'm not 100% comfortable with (smalltalk with coworkers, my boss, talking in front of several people).
For example I'll want to say ""Those politicians make me upset too!"" and I'll studder ""Those piloti- uuh politicians...."". So far only one person has pointed it out,  others don't react to it. But it keeps happening. Or sometimes I'll want to say one word but in the last splitsecond my brains decides to use another synonym. I'd want to say shit but my brain decides on more a more polite ""damn"" instead and I end up almost saying a mix of it: shamn.

Has anyone else experienced this? :( I'd rather not take meds again though, because I felt like they made my speech slower in general..."

Primary Complaint: Brain fog, depression, slow thinking, disconnection, etc.

I just always feel like my brain is slow. It just feels blank when I try to use it for anything such as talking with people, talking to myself in my head, going through a problem and trying to find a solution for it, making decisions, etc. Even when I'm just by myself at home and not around people and experiencing depression and anxiety my brain feels slow. This makes me wonder how much of this is even due to depression. But maybe I have it so often and for so long the symptoms just continue. There's a lot of feelings I have and sometimes even ideas, but I can never figure out a way express/articulate it like everyone else around me. It's like the words just don't come to me. It's like the words are there but there is a fog which I can't see through. 

I also struggle with feeling disconnected from the physical world every day. Some moments are more noticeable than others, but I feel its always there. It just feels almost like I'm just watching a movie of my life, or even of someone else's life. Like there is a screen or filter between me and the objective reality around me in which I'm forced to live in and interact with. When people are having conversations around me, it just feels like I'm listening to it through some sort of filter, like listening to people talk in a podcast through a computer, or in a movie through a tv screen. My mind just feels removed from the world around. I feel like a zombie or robot living with no real purpose at all. Just moving in an automaticity and clockwork way. 

I feel depressed almost everyday. I'll wake up feeling okay or happy. Be depressed on the way to work. Feel even more depression accompanied with anxiety while working. Then finally feel relieved when coming back home from work. The cycle just repeats. Life feels meaningless like this tbh. If anyone's experienced anything similar please offer some help"

Anxiety,succesfully learning to live with my anxiety and depression (and you can too),"(skip to the bottom for the main points/advice and PLEASE try them, they are so easy to implement but make such a huge difference its baffling)

okay, so for me, suffering with super bad anxiety and depression, i was put on 50mg of sertraline whilst i waited for therapy (still waiting as time is 8-10 month on average). first couple weeks after the negative side effects dissapeared, i was on a massive massive high and basically cured. looking back in hindsight, it was probably mania. i kept thinking to myself, is this how life is supposed to be? it was flawless. then that feeling went away, and my anxiety slowly creeped up on me. depression had dissipated though and i was able to do things that i wasn't before. i could get out of bed in the morning, start going places and stop constantly dreading life and debating its point. then my depression came back after a few weeks, so i upped my dose to 100. same thing happened and i had a slightly manic couple of days, which i was so happy about, but when they passed, i became unhappy. i now realise that i became unhappy because dealing with addiction problems, i constantly craved the manic state, and the high. when i realised this and took a step back, knowing that it was unnatural and unrealistic to have every day, i found a bit more comfort in life. just like when i had my lower dose, my anxiety was still there, but because my depression was lifted, i was able to do things and make the effort to better myself. basically, sertraline took away my depression enough that i was able to help myself create healthy habits and do things that i was unable to before, which means that i can now look after myself. i think it's super important to realise for me at least, depression is a cycle = feeling unmotivated and not doing anything-&gt;depressed-&gt;feeling unmotivated and not doing anything etc etc. this is why i am grateful i was able to temporarily break the cycle. now i know that i no longer need to chase this fabricated high, and that i can create my own happiness. although it is not as intense and it never will be, that is okay, because now the negatives are not as intense too, and i no longer will have to go through not moving from bed for days, or not showering for even longer. it's about balance. i am now taking myself off of them because i feel like i am now in control of my own brain and life. whilst i initally felt that the sertraline was not working anymore, i now realise it has in fact worked perfectly. so this is my message to everyone to stick it out, and to not expect it to create instant happiness magically for you, but to instead put in the work and let it help and assist you in doing it yourself.

other things that very very much helped me:

\- the highly sensitive person by Elaine Aron = realising a lot of my anxiety was just overstimulation; i highly highly reccomend reading this

\- cutting out caffeine (mostly) or at least definitely not after 12pm or one cup a day (VERY very IMPORTANT)

\- cutting down time on overly stimulating apps like tiktok and replacing with stiller things like reading

\- when panicking/overstimulated, writing down my thoughts instead of just letting them spiral in my head

\- spending more time in nature and stillness

\- reducing alcohol and drugs (isn't as enjoyable on sertraline anyway)

\- thinking of myself from another person's perspective and giving them (me) advice and helping

\- gratitude, cliche but it actually works

\- looking inwards at the connection between anxiety and depression, and how one leads to another (for me anxiety leads to overthinking which leads to depression)

\- eating more whole foods and not junk crap (still working on this one)

\- excersise = tiring out my mind reduced the anxiety and energy that was put into negative thoughts

\- asking others for advice from their point of view, as my mind is very black and white and i cannot see my actions from another perspective

\- remembering when i have a bad time that it will pass and it isn't permanent; this is where gratitude comes into play as instead of thinking to myself that everything is bad and it will never get any better, reminding myself of all the good things that exist and that will return once this phase has passed

\- introspection in general

remember to never give up! it's hard, but it's totally worth it, and it is a lot easier than you think! i promise!"
Anxiety,Feel like I don’t even know my own body anymore,"So I’ve been having tightness in my chest for about 24 hrs now and my anxiety is telling me that if we don’t run to the ER we are going to die. I went to the doctor and he was like wellll to be safe here’s a referral to a cardiologist and I call and I have to wait 6months. Which made my anxiety worse bc I’m like so basically if I have a heart problem I spend 5000$ at a hospital or just like die- great. 

But the most frustrating thing of all is Idk if this tightness is more or not! Is it a cold? Mucus draining? Allergies? Because I slept weird? Because I’m stressed? Muscle strain? It’s like my own body is an enemy to me and I don’t even know what is normal and what is a real threat anymore. Like people say listen to your body or my doctor- if it feels worse go to the ER- I DONT KNOW! 

Like I know it’s not anxiety because it’s constant. It’s not a heart attack either bc it’s been over 24 hrs. But everything else- idk. Heart infection? Pericardial effusion? And all these things they’re like “you can’t tell on your own so go to the doctor or ER”

Im like Idk what you want me to do because I don’t know what is a risk and what isn’t! Like I’m scared maybe I’m noticing something early before it gets bad and now is the time to intervene but then I don’t know if it’s actually something bad or not.

I wish I could just put another person in my body and be like “yo on a scale of 1-10 how bad or concerning does this feel” bc I just don’t know anymore. 

Im scared and exhausted and sick to my stomach and convinced I’m dying and I’m not going to get help in time. 

I just feel like I’m a stranger in my own body and I know nothing and I just wanna cry."
Anxiety,Worried for the women of America.,"I'm in Australia and I would feel devastated if my rights were stripped from me in this very personal way. I am so sorry.

Anxiety,How to deal with racing thoughts?,"When I get anxious, my worst symptom is racing thoughts. I cannot stop them and they consume all my energy. I cannot even sleep! 
I tried mediation, I am able to stop them for a few minutes but then they are back again. 
Do you have any advice?"
Anxiety,worst day in a while,"my anxiety today is probably the worst its been in a couple months (triggered by a couple of things) but im proud of myself cause i still managed to wake up early, get ready, give a presentation with a group for uni, have a job interview in which i presented a case study and i think they both went well. 

my mind now feels mentally exhausted and im physically tired but im proud of myself tbh"
Anxiety,Is anyone scared of making phone calls ?,"So I hate speaking on the phone , making phone calls , accepting phone calls which has led me to lose a lot of friends (which I get because I can be really annoying and we need phones in this current day and age) I am ok with that. 

But  what I'm not okay with is when I wake up late for work and can't seem to make a phone call to let them know I'm gonna be late. So I end up not going in. It's 1.20 pm , I haven't gone into work and no one knows why as I won't contact them. 
I know soon enough, I'll be fired for this but I can't seem to change it.

Anyone else have difficulty with being late and not calling in?"
Anxiety,medication experiences?,"Hi. I was curious to hear others' experience of starting medication for anxiety. Ive been anxious since before I entered years high school (I'm 25 - so for over 10 years its been severe now). I'm about to finish a graduate certificate program in August and I'll need to find a job by October, so I'm interested in trying anxiety medication because my anxiety has reached life-impacting levels since the pandemic and I have a hard time even leaving my house alone to run errands. At this point I feel medication is essential for my wellbeing and ability to thrive. 

How did you start the conversation with your doctor? Did you try alternative medications and options? What's been successful for you? 

Thanks in advance."
Anxiety,How to calm anxiety before important event,"More specifically, a driving test. I have failed my driving test about 3 times now and the more i fail, the more anxious i get. 

Im currently not on any medication and i have also just started therapy. 

I’m just wondering if anyone have any advise on how to calm nerves and reduce brain fog before important events as i cant effort to fail anymore."
Anxiety,Resources about anxiety meds?,"My GP has recommended I take citalopram for anxiety. They want me to think about it for a bit and since I’m 18 they want to wait until I’m at home with my mum in case of side effects in the first few weeks. Now I’m starting to convince myself out of it!

I can’t take beta-blockers and given the waiting lists it’ll probably be next year before I can get to therapy. I need help but the idea of taking antidepressants does feel a little daunting, especially given all the anecdotes on here.

I’m cautious of any anecdotes or advice given on Reddit but does anyone have any resources they could share? I’m feeling a little lost at the moment."
Anxiety,overcoming my fear of bad results,"hi everyone! I am about to book one or all of these three tests: mri/CT/xray (not sure how they work in my case) as I am scared I have a tumour/cancer in my spine or brain. im only 22 and im scared as ive had a two week long on and off headache, back pain after sleeping, and dizziness and lightheaded sensations after getting up from lying down when tanning in the sun. my neck and jaw felt very stiff and sore for a week as well. really nervous to book these as i really don’t want to hear that’s something is wrong but it’s the best thing to do. wish me luck. :("

Anxiety,Inexplicable anxiety,"Lately my anxiety is through the roof again! It completely paralyses me. At work I often seem to be frozen. And at home I can't relax.

The thing is, I can't identify any cause. I have so much to be thankful about. My work, my private life, wife, daughter, house, etc... It's all going so well. I don't drink any alcohol. Don't smoke. My health is fine and I don't take any medications that could cause it. I work out a lot, because it seems to be the only thing that calms me right now. I literally can't think of anything that I might be (subconsciously) worrying about. 

I even thought that it may be something medical, so I went to my GP. They did some blood tests, which all came out normal. 

This anxious feeling has been constantly present months now. It came and went before a few years back, and I'm still oblivious to what caused that too. I also don't know what I did to make it go away. 

It's like I'm in this chronic state of fight or flight. A constant feeling of impending doom. My heart is racing all day, as if I'm watching a horror movie. And I'm not interested in any of my hobbies.

Any tips? How do I handle this? I know quick fixes are not encouraged, but I could really use one. Even if it is just to be able to think straight again and enable me to search for a more long term solution."

Anxiety,[Share your story with me]: I am so tired that people don’t understand.,"I am tired of living in a world, especially a nation (Like the effing United States), where I am constantly faced with the most inhumane, disrespectful, un-empathetic (not even a word I think) people that never understand let alone try to understand.

I am tired of being a woman with rights getting stripped and knowing that my government doesn’t give a shit about women, and that so many men are fucking predators to women.

I am tired of being chronically ill/disabled where people don’t understand how difficult it is to do certain things or have even a part time job, or how shitty medical care gets the moment you are chronically ill. I am tired of how difficult it would even be to get on disability, and that even if I did, the tiny amount of money I am likely to get wouldn’t help me at all.

I am tired of being misunderstood as someone that is on the spectrum as an aromantic and asexual, and how people don’t seem to understand what “I don’t want to date people” means, or any other boundaries or lack of interests in certain things.

I am tired of having a mental illness that also makes things difficult to function or do certain things, and people’s advice is total shit.

I am tired and so stressed and overwhelmed, and I feel like it didn’t really hit me until now.

Anxiety,Extreme anxiety after collapsing in public.,"A few weeks ago I was on a train to work. Completely ordinary day and a journey I’ve made before. I walked 20 minutes to the station and was happy that the train was running a bit early so I would get to walk earlier. 

I stood on the train for 5 minutes (this is typical for the first half of the journey and as people get off you get a seat) and suddenly had a rush of nausea - nothing unusual but just felt sick. I thought I’d get off at the next stop but it passed in a minute or so, so I decided to take a seat that had become available and just carry on the journey. 

I remember sitting down looking out the window and then woke up in the recovery position on the train floor with about 10 people standing over me. I panicked and thought I’d fell so I asked a man to help me off. He explained that I’d lost consciousness for about 5 minutes and the train was being stopped and everyone was getting off. I then vomited into a bag someone gave me and had to take my shoes and socks off as I was sweating profusely. 

An ambulance then arrived and I was told I was at risk of my heart stopping as my pulse was too slow. I was genuinely feeling like I would die, I just couldn’t get enough breath in. I passed out again in the ambulance and the next thing I knew I was in A&amp;E with about 5 staff standing over me tipping the trolley I was in and hooking me up to various machines. Then I heard the nurse say “we’re taking you to resus don’t panic”. 

I just kept thinking “youre dying” and “your heart is going to stop”. I was genuinely so scared. 

After 6 hours I was deemed okay and left hospital. I was just wanting to get home so my family picked me up. I’ve been at my parents house since, dizzy and terrified of passing out again. I won’t go anywhere on my own. I’ve managed short walks but always with my parents. 

I don’t think anyone realised how frightening it was :( I’m 28 and just confined to my parents house. 

It’s horrible to think that life can so easily be compromised on your average day."
Anxiety,"I just ate a moldy crumpet, will I be okay?","So I have a huge fear of being sick/just being unwell in general and I want to know if I will be okay after just eating a crumpet that I found had a bit of mold on the inside. The crumpet didn't taste bad but I noticed the green colour when i took a bite out of it. I'm unsure if the rest of the crumpet was moldy or if it was just that bit but either way I'm freaking out. My parents keep telling me it's fine but my anxiety hasn't calmed down at all. It wasn't past it's best before date but it was still moldy, anyone know if it's okay to eat?

Anxiety,Intimacy,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years. We’re moving in together, very happy couple, no issues in the slightest.

However, both of us are adamant that we don’t want biological children. I’m a teacher, and not only does the idea of child birth terrify me but I know how many kids out there deserve a foster home that I can one day adopt. Adoption and fostering is the route we both want to go, it’s perfect for both of us.

Naturally, neither one of us wants kids yet - but that doesn’t mean we’re not sexually intimate with each other. He uses condoms every time. I’m on birth control. He’s talked about getting a vasectomy, etc.

…But now that Roe V Wade has happened, I’m afraid to be intimate with him. No matter how many precautions we take, the small part of my mind is worried about that what if situation. That if all the stars align perfectly… what if?

I almost feel as though I can’t be intimate with him again until he gets a vasectomy, which I’m sure he’s willing to do without a doubt. But… I don’t know when that would happen.

I’ve always been comforted by that small thought of IF something happened, god forbid, I could get an abortion. But now…

Sigh. Anxiety sucks, but a small part of me wonders now if this is warranted…"
Anxiety,Stuck in a rut,"Ive always struggled with social anxiety and GAD as long as I can remember. Right before the pandemic I was going thru a break up with someone I was really in love with. I developed strong relationship OCD and started having panic attacks at work constantly. I felt miserable so I finally made an appointment with a psychiatrist to get on some meds. He put me on Prozac and it somehow made everything even worse. I could barely function and my intrusive thoughts were worse than ever before. He kept telling me to wait it out till the medicine took full effect. But after 8 weeks I had to go stay with my mom for a bit and wean off because it was to the point where I couldn't eat and was starting to lose a lot of weight. Right after this the pandemic started and my roommate/best friend got into a new relationship and basically moved out immediately. I felt so alone and isolated, signed up for an online therapy and self medicated constantly with weed. The therapy helped a bit but not as much as I had hoped so I switched therapists a few times. I started getting depressed because even though I was doing the exposures there was something inside that still felt miserable and I was still having a lot of panic attacks. I really like my current therapist and I see her weekly and have been doing the exposures that she assigns. There are still times tho when I feel horribly depressed and anxious and can barely even get out of bed. I'm so scared to try meds again because of how it went the first time but it feels like I'm trapped in this cycle and even with the therapy I don't see any way out. I haven't given up completely but I don't really know what else to do.."

Anxiety,Anyone else thinking of killing themselves?,"
I’m 27. I have never had an actual relationship. I used to go on dates when I was 19-20, but I got very depressed and stopped doing much. I mostly just stayed inside and smoked weed.

I’m 27 now and I’ve finished college. I have a pretty high paying job, around 190k a year. I have basically no close friends, just one or two guys I see once or twice a year. And I have no dating prospects. I went on a few online and in person dates and they have not gone well at all. I’ve felt basically zero connection and they didn’t really seem to like me either.

I’ve been wanting to kill myself for a few years. Life seems very painful and pointless. Not having friends or any real chance at a relationship are the hardest parts but it’s all hard. My dog is dying. My grandma is dying. Once they’re gone, I’m sticking a bullet in my brain.

Yes I go to therapy. I’ve been going for months, it doesn’t help. I’m not willing to take antidepressants as they can increase suicidal thoughts. I don’t have any hobbies but not for lack of trying, I can’t become interested or make friends at any of the ones I’ve tried.

I’m going to apply for a handgun permit tomorrow."
Anxiety,Should I be anxious ?,"There’s a new instagram feature where there’s a small feature that if you tap it like pops up with loads of emojis, anyway this girl my boyfriend follows posted a selfie on her instagram story with the reaction tab and he accidentally pressed it and it sent 😍 he messaged me straight away like I’m sorry this is so embarrassing for me etc. and he messaged saying it was an accident and said he can unfollow/block her but I just feel anxious that it wasn’t an accident. I’ve seen the thing and it does seem very easy to accidentally press when scrolling through instagram stories."
Anxiety,fear of other mental illnesses,"Okay trying again but making a more clear post. 
I would like to preface this by stating that Thirteen psychs and therapist have said I do not have anything psychotic or delusional(not to mention all the er visits that have also said no)

I do not have a family history of anything delusional or psychotic. My biological mom does have bipolar but I have been ruled out for that as well as major depressive disorder and again anything psychotic. 

However I can't shake the feeling that something is being missed or that something else is wrong with me. 

I'm pregnant for the first time ever I'm 25 weeks along and before I knew I was pregnant went off my effexor (because it wasn't helping me) and smoked pot for the first time for maybe about ten days. 

I stopped immediately after having a panic attack where I experienced dpdr. (Everything felt fake time slowed down I felt like I was dreaming even wondered if I was hallucinating everything around me. but consciously still knew I was fine and that none of that was true) 

I was fine the next day but the day after that my ocd started focusing on harm thoughts. I've had a long history of ocd, as a kid I was worried with my own mortality and worried and obsessed about natural disasters like tornados killing me and my mom, I've had intrusive thoughts about harming my cat which I have since worked through and never wanted to act on. I have had relationship ocd where I worried if my partner was cheating on me and or if he really loved me. I have had perfection ocd where I worried if my boss liked me and the job I was doing. But I never was aware what I was struggling with was ocd  (because of common pop culture representation) i only ever thought it was anxiety 

The thoughts I began to have were ""what if I stabbed my husband?"" Or ""what if I choked my mom?"" Or ""what if im having a psychotic break and do something I don't mean to do?"" (Because I started researching about psychosis and delusions and Scizophrenia, big mistake) 

I eventually went to the er and they diagnosed me with ocd and sent me home. 

I worked through the ocd but then the derealization came back. Nothing felt real/felt like I was in a dream/ I started worrying about existinal thoughts (existinal ocd) 'where I wondered how reality worked ?"" ""What If I was dreaming my whole life?"" ""What if the world was a simulation?"" I worried so much I went back to the er and they again sent me home saying it was just my ocd and gad and dpdr. I also found out I was a month pregnant at this time. 


I then started compulsively researching Scizophrenia/ delusional disorder/ psychosis because the dpdr and existinal ocd made me feel like I was crazy or suffering from something worse. 

So then my themes switched to fear of having a psychosis disorder (any of them all of them I was really scared.) It first started as being hyper focused on sounds worried I could be hallucinating. Eventually that went away and I started worrying about common delusions people with psychotic disorders may have. I didn't even know these were a thing until I looked them up. (Thanks ocd) 

They freaked me out so much that people could think that way that my ocd intrusive thoughts started mimicking them in a way. ""What if your mom/husband poisioned your food?"" 
""What if someone was out to get you?"" ""What if your hallucinating everything and you don't know?"" Etc. 
I never beleived any of these thoughts because I knew they were extremely irrational however because of my fears of becoming psychotic and not being able to care for my baby on the way and be a good wife to my husband (who is my biggest support and best friend aside from my mom ) they made me so anxious I worried that if I thought them I must beleive them (even though again I knew deep down I didn't and that they only appeared after reading about them) 

Anyway that brings us to now. I have in the last month switched over to a new psych and therapist after working with my old ones for a year because my old ones made things worse. 

My old therapist fed the ocd sooooo much and never taught me the proper way to deal with it (what I now know is erp) and my old psychiatrist would put me on multiple meds at a time and take me off of them with in two to three weeks if I wasn't (in his words) ""better"" by then. 

I tried lexapro/trazadone/buspar(made dpdr worse)

Amd lastly a low dose (50mg) of seroquel for ""sleep and anxiety"" 

Seroquel made my dpdr (depersonalization and derealization) so bad that people like my husband and mom and even cat at times looked unfamiliar and felt like strangers al my memories with these people and of my life felt distant or like thwy happened to someone else. I still knew who they were but everything felt off. Even my own home felt and looked odd to me. 


I was officially convinced I was psychotic after experiencing this because no one on my old team explained to me that what I was going through in these moments of ""unreality"" was a anxiety/stress trauma response called dpdr. 

So as any compulsive person does I took to reddit and Google to research why my loved ones felt like stranger to me (and at times looked strange) I of course found plenty of dpdr related articles. But the one that stuck out to me was a article about caogras delusion. 

Capgras is a delusion typically found in patients with demntia/lewy body/ alzihmers(I know I spelt it wrong) and of course my biggest fear paranoid Scizophrenia. It is a delusion where people have the belief that a loved one has been replaced with usually one of the following 
A clone
A doppelganger 
A imposter 
A alien or monster 
Or a robot. 

Now at first I was like ""Okay that's obviously not me because I don't beleive in clones or doppelganger or imposters aliens or robots "" but then the ocd took over and my ocd intrusive thoughts began mimicking this delusions (as it has done with other delusions in the past) 

""What if your husband isn't your husband?"" 
""What if he's been replaced?"" 
""What if he Is a alien?"" 
""How do people eve exist?""

I never even knew these were thoughts a person could have until I read about it and now I wish I hadn't. I then started seeing my new psychiatrist and therapist. My new psychiatrist got me off the seroquel and put me on zoloft I am now up to 200mg of zoloft and it seems to be helping for the most part (though I don't think it's fully in my system yet) she said I'm not psychotic and that this is just a mixture of being on the wrong medication plus hormones from being pregnant plus dpdr/anxiety/and ocd. 

My new therapist said the same and that all of my thoughts and anxieties were normal for ocd with the fear of Scizophrenia and or a existinal theme and that I wasn't delusional or psychotic in the slightest and that we would start the proper therapy (erp) to help with this. 

My dpdr has calmed down quite a bit I don't have it every day like I did on seroquel. I still have moments of it but I'm mostly able to sit with it and let it past. But the thought of ""What if my husband has been replaced?"" Has been coming and going and causing me distress since June 6th. Some days I am able to be like ""wtf that's not possible its just the dpdr and ocd"" and other days like yesterday I'm in tears and fully convinced I'm delusional and that I may beleive it (even though again deep down I know I dont) 

I am hustle worried one day I will fully beleive this and hurt him. 😢  and I don't want that to happen. I am also worried that if this isn't undercontrol soon I will be a terrible mom to my baby and wife to my husband. 

Espically if I do become delusional. 

I guess what I'm looking for here is insight. 

Should I trust my doctors and the Thirteen other providers that told me it's just ocd dpdr anxiety and hormones 

Or is it something worse going unseen or something starting to develop?  

I know this is reassurance seeking but I'm just so worried and in the early stages of therapy and really trying to beat the ocd. I also feel like I'm the only possible person to experience this thought. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? 

Please help."
Anxiety,Interrogator in my head.,"Any time I make a choice or decision in my head there’s this “voice” that interrogates me and makes me second guess my thoughts. My brain asks myself “why” and I become defensive against…myself? I don’t understand it. I’m an even keeled person so it’s not going to change me for the worse, it’s just frustrating. Does anyone else have this?"
Anxiety,Very anxious and need to talk to someone. I got severe burns all over my body and I’m sitting at the hospital now waiting to get bandages changed. Very tired and just not feeling to well. Anxiety is through the roof right now and need someone to talk to. Help take my mind off things,
Anxiety,I need some help..,"Hey so it’s a bit on the longer end but I really need help so if you can listen and offer some insight or even just tell me your experience. So I have been unwell for a long time now, after developing Covid at the end of April and then two weeks later coming down with another respiratory infection I’ve never fully seemed to recover back to good health. Cough has lingered on for over a month, along with bad shortness of breath, sometimes it’s so bad I really think I’m gonna die. I’ve been to doctors, they didn’t even really examine me one of them literally just prescribed anotibiotics automatically then practically me gestured for me to leave and another said it’s post viral cough likely🤦‍♀️ they all saying different things and no one even bothers to take a chest x ray or anything, even when I went to the ER in hopes to get one. My parents refuse to hear of my “crazy shit” anymore, they don’t even take my complaints seriously anymore and sometimes I feel my life is worth nothing in anyone else’s eyes but mine. My mum even said it once I had an emergency who do I think would really take me seriously anymore? I’m just a number to the whole system and even if I died, life would go on and  everyone would forget about me and my pointless and avoidable physical suffering. My parents might miss me for a little but they’d eventually realise it’s much easier without me and actually heave a sigh of relief: I’m a massive burden on them. The world wouldn’t even feel my absence. I don’t have many friends, and my family doesn’t like me much. And why would they? Who likes someone who’s always suffering and letting them know she isn’t well?

Now, the thing is, I’ve had this shortness of breath and cough intermittently for over a month with wheezing occasionally but yesterday evening I had one out of two pretty bad coughing fits I nearly spat my lungs out. After it eventually subsided, really bad shortness of breath and wheezing remained and it actually is still here and has been constantly here for over 24 hours now. My mum has asthma she’s had it since she was 17 she’s 45 now but since she got diagnosed with it years it’s pretty much under control for her. She suggested for me to use a rescue inhaler last night which I eventually reluctantly did because I’m also on Escitalopram and I’ve heard from multiple places that taking Ventolin with Escitalopram can cause a dangerous even lethal heart arrhythmia. I took two puffs cause she scared me, saying it could be an asthma attack and what if I get unwell at night. The wheezing somewhat subsided but came back in about 30 mins, coughing somewhat subsided but it’s now been over 24 hours and I’ve been feeling breathless the whole day. I know while lips and fingers aren’t blue the problem isn’t that bad but I’m just terrified I’ve got undiagnosed asthma triggered by the infections I’ve had this past month and knowing the doctors around here my chances of getting treated for it, let alone diagnosed.. are pretty slim? I’ve heard of people my age dying of asthma attacks that became severe pretty quickly and this way of suffocating that I’ve already been feeling, just really scares me. Shortness of breath is always there, sometimes less but almost always there.

I’ve suspected I could have asthma for a while, but now it seems pretty clear it’s probably got triggered. The thing is it’s been untreated, and it feels really dangerous. Being short of breath and constant chest tightness all day is also terrifying. I got a spirometry once years ago but I wasn’t symptomatic at that very time of the test so it didn’t show any abnormalities. It’s now the evening again and my symptoms always feel worse in the evening for some reason. I have an appointment booked with a GP for tomorrow but I don’t really have any hopes up to even get a referral for any kind of test.

My mother says she’s way too tired and can’t deal with this. She always gets irritated when I talk to her about my symptoms. I’ve had death anxiety for a while now but this asthma business is really making it worse. I’m also afraid my family might cremate me if I die and i really don’t want that, I’ve made it clear I want to be buried because one way I try to cope with my death anxiety is to just pretend death is like a sleep. One way I’ve been trying to cope with this immense fear of dying is that I’ve been trying to think of death as more of something positive than negative, as a journey instead of an end. Dying sucks, especially when it happens young and avoidable but I’ve been telling myself that it’s likely only a couple of very bad minutes or hours of physical and mental suffering and terror, and then it’s all over and it’s probably nothing but peace after that. That death is okay, it’s natural, it happens to millions of others at the same time as it will occur to me and I won’t be crossing the great divide alone. Even if it seems that way.
That if I’ll ever have to be suffocating because my pleas for help are overlooked, then I’ll just close my eyes and process the agony and try to embrace dying as a transition to peace, instead of thinking about my lost life.
That when death comes, it means my body is in need of rest and that it’s fought and fought ferociously to keep me alive but it can’t be stretched beyond its limits forever.

Yet, when shortness of breath gets this bad, and I get a coughing attack, unspeakable terror washes over me and every cell of my body wants to cling to life. It’s not time yet, I’m only 23. Please lord don’t let me die yet, give me another chance! I have so many dreams and aspirations and such a hunger for life😔
How do you make peace with mortality? Regard it as a friend and not an enemy? How can you ever be okay with the possibility of dying so young, lonely, overlooked and neglected, and full of dreams?

Plus I’m also really scared what’s after death? Like what if it isn’t the peace I’d hope it is?"
Anxiety,Bad health anxiety rn,I did a lab test like over a week ago. But i ate two hot pockets and some snacks before. I didn’t know i was suppose to fast all night. My doc messaged and said that my my cholesterol and blood sugar is elevated. And my vitamin D levels are too high (I am going to stop taking the sublingual drops). I am a bit anxious rn about all of this. Thinking I’m gonna die
Anxiety,I feel like every interview I do goes terribly,"I mean I've had jobs before and I've even landed a research position so evidently that's not 100% true, but it feels like it. No matter how much I prepare my mind always goes blank and I stumble over my words and it's just a mess. Interviews are definitely the least accurate representation of who I am as a person and an employee which is so frustrating. This is just a minimum wage college job too and I felt like I was interviewing for some major company with the questions they asked me."

Anxiety,My first benzo prescription,"Hi everyone

For the past 4 days my anxiety has been through the roof (haven't had a moment where I'm calm) so I went to see my psychologist + doctor today. They prescribed me 0.5 mg of xanax which I have to take whenever I crave some mental rest. 

For some reason I've been very anxious to take it though (ironic i know). I once took 3 xanax bars in college (6mg total) and didn't really notice much so it's not that I'm scared about the dosage or anything.

How would y'all go about this situation? I feel so weird for being anxious about taking a drug  that's supposed to help with my anxiety..."

Anxiety,Anxiety causing me to stop exercise (running) early,"Hi guys,

Had anxiety, particularly health related the past month. A few unfortunate family matters this year including my Dad being diagnosed with terminal cancer, and bam, here it is. Doc checked me over and my pains are stress-related, and trying to coach my brain to understand that. Not working all the time though, particularly when I go running. Am trying to keep the exercise up, I know it's important to help me  through this (and just generally helpful) but I get 2km into a run and I feel like my heart rate goes through the roof, I feel shaky and I stop running and walk home. Crazy eh, given the point of exercise is to get the heart rate up, but my mind joins my heart rate in racing and I get scared and stop.

Anyone else have this issue, and any tips on what to do. I will keep trying for sure, just super frustrating and upsetting."
Anxiety,Anxiety and de ja vu,"Hello i am 20F, don’t do drugs or drink and not on any medications. Okay so, this is my first time posting anything on reddit and my mind is also all over the place so i’m sorry if this whole thing is a mess. Its been a month now but i recently relapsed into really bad anxiety and depression. Let me first explain my first experience with anxiety and depression. 
This was in May of 2019 where i experienced extreme de ja vu throughout the ENTIRE day. Before this all happened i was already dealing with the normal feelings of depression and anxiety, and then for some reason on my brothers graduation day, May 20th 2019, i was experiencing very intense de ja vu and i felt like i had already seen everything that was happening. I felt like i had died and i was in hell. Before it all happened i did have smaller experiences of de ja vu leading up to the graduation. Back then i was on an antidepressant called Zoloft but i stopped taking it maybe about a year and a half or so ago. I did also smoke weed back then. A little side story was (this was before my brothers graduation) one time i was high asf in class and i experienced the same feeling as i did at my brothers graduation but it did not last as long. I felt like my teacher and everyone in the class was doing the same thing and i felt like i was in a loop and it was really scary. Now i don’t know if that traumatized me and caused me to experience the intense all day de ja vu on my brothers graduation. Also my grandpa (who raised me) died july 2019 and it put me in a severe depressive state and gave me death anxiety, but no de ja vu. ANYWAYS. Fast forwarding to the present time. I am now extremely terrified of taking any type of medication or doing any type of drugs, which i guess is good in some ways but also not because i am so anxious. I cant even take regular medicine for like a cold and have never drank any alcohol because i’m too scared of losing control. 
But the whole reason of why i am posting this is because i went for a whole year maybe a little longer without being on any antidepressants and not experiencing any de ja vu and i was living life perfectly fine. Then out of nowhere on May 28th i had a really bad panic attack. First i thought it was just a normal panic attack but then i kept waking up every morning feeling overly anxious and like shit. At first there was no de ja vu and i was just anxious about silly stuff and over reacting. Then i started to get anxiety about going crazy, my death anxiety came back, and now de ja vu. At first i was like “hey at least theres no de ja vu” and then a couple weeks in i start getting these like feelings of familiarity. Its definitely not as intense as my brothers graduation day. For example something will happen and later on in the day ill look back at that memory and it will feel really familiar and it kind of freaks me out. I don’t have like full episodes of de ja vu just sometimes in the moment or when i look back at it , it feels familiar. I don’t know if this is happening because i’m really stressed out, or if i’m just making a big deal out of it and just making the feeling up. I don’t know what to think. If anyone has ever experienced anything like this please let me know. Or if anyone has any useful advice to share, please do."

Anxiety,Do I have anxiety or something worse?,"(20M) I had covid around the end of may and since have been 24 days covid negative. I felt so much panic during my isolation even though I had such mild symptoms only stuffy nose, sweating, and a dry cough. I would feel like I was having a damn panic attack. After I tested negative I felt amazing until, I still had a lingering on and off again cough but I felt pretty good once I went back to work I had little to no panic symptoms. Last Tuesday I woke up fine with no I’ll feelings but once I had breakfast I heard a slight wheeze when I coughed and my minds lost it. I have shortness of breath to the point where I am constantly taking deep breaths and I still feel like I’m not getting enough oxygen. I keep using my pulse oxygen meter and I’m always between 95-100%. I have barely even have a cough anymore but I can’t stop thinking that I’m going to die from bronchitis or some heart attack. Last week I went to urgent care and my chest x ray came back as normal. I feel like I’m making everyone around me go crazy over how much I’m perseverating over all of this. I’ll feel normal but then BOOM, I feel these thoughts and suddenly I’m short of breath and it sucks so much. I’ll have some chest soreness sometimes too. I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety before nor have I ever felt this way. Is this normal anxiety symptoms or should I be worried? Does anyone know what this is?"
Anxiety,I notice I have no anxiety when grieving . but idk what's worse,This post really isn't useful considering it's double edge sword but I do find it interesting while I grieve my anxiety is gone. My chest isn't tight ... I feel like I can breath again....  There's got to be some science behind it but maybe grieving will be a anxiety reset..... One could only hope .
Anxiety,?????,The mods said I was a troll and they keep deleting my posts of anxieties that come up WTF
Anxiety,Is this anxiety related dissociation or just my mind blanking out?,"

This morning shortly after waking up I felt something in my body was just off. I don’t have much memory of what I did this morning though. I know I got up, got ready for work, and checked my phone but I can’t remember any of the details or picture myself doing that this morning. I felt spaced out and like I was just a head being carried by a body that wasn’t my own, going through the motions. My hearing has been sharper today too. I’m home on my lunch break now and while being at work and doing things helped a bit I still feel out of it and like I’m devoid of emotion. On the bright side all the things that have been stressing me out recently haven’t been today. I almost feel zen. My head sounds like a low buzz right now. I’ve never been able to pinpoint what this feeling is but it’s been happening a bit more frequently. For me it’s kind of like the feeling you get when you walk out of a movie theatre and have to adjust to the real world sights and sounds. I don’t want to just assume this is dissociation because Ive had these feelings before and always assumed I was just zoning out or a side effect of my benzo meds. What could this be and should I be concerned? Thanks for anyone who reads this."
Anxiety,Wondering if this is more than anxiety,These symptoms appeared suddenly a few years ago. I remember going to the ER with anxiety that I couldn't get under control. They ran some tests and everything was fine. The anxiety went on for awhile before I started thinking maybe it's time to get a mental health assessment. They mentioned stress and sent me home. Then these voices started and I panicked. It only happens when I'm about asleep. I still deal with this. I went to a Psych Center and admitted myself thinking that I was having more than anxiety going on. I was sent home with referrals to counseling and was told the voices around sleep are normal. For months I thought I was losing my mind. I'm way older than when things like that start. I'm not on drugs or anything like that. I get intrusive thoughts that cause panic. Seriously what's going on here?
Anxiety,Fear of schizophrenia,I'm tired of worrying and getting anxiety attacks about this.
Anxiety,No side effects on Lexapro?,"I started taking Lexapro a few days ago, today is Day 4. I am only taking 5 mg a day. I have yet to notice any side effects and am really hoping I don’t have any at all *knock on wood*. I am leaving on a cruise on July 2nd so I really don’t want to experience any while on the cruise. Is this because I’m on a low dose? Anyone else on 5 mg experience the same? Mg sister is also on 5 mg and she said she only got dizzy for the first week."
Anxiety,Getting off of SSRIs,"*disclaimer* not looking for medical advice but more stories, thoughts, guidance, etc…

I’ve been on a low dose SSRI for several years for my anxiety and I don’t necessarily feel like it’s doing anything but I’m nervous to get off of something I’ve been on for so long and how dependent my body has become on it. It’s honestly giving me more anxiety. Has anyone even taken something for a while and been able to successful stop?"
Anxiety,First panic attack from smoking weed?,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask about this but I was hoping for some advice.

So two nights ago I ended up taking two hits from my roommate's boyfriend's joint. I never smoke and he does it daily so I'm pretty sure he had something with a lot of THC, which I know can be bad for someone with anxiety (I'm an anxious person but not diagnosed, I do have ADHD though). Anyways, I started to get really quiet and nervous so I went to my room, which was when I think the panic attack set in. It was a really scary experience and I was super anxious + paranoid and had auditory hallucinations. My heart was pounding and I felt like I was losing control/gonna die. 

There was a bunch of other stuff that happened but I won't go too much into it, I think it lasted around 20-30 minutes. I did a lot of research the next day and I'm pretty sure it was a panic attack? Not entirely sure but I was wondering what I should do moving forward. I'm definitely not touching weed or any other drugs again. Should I see a therapist or should I wait until/if it happens again to get help?"
Anxiety,"Relationship anxiety and distrust, anyone dealt with this?","I've been through a lot of volatile relationships and had a stormy youth, but now I'm finally in an era of peace and love and support and my anxiety has been wilder than ever. In my last house, I had conflict with someone who made me feel like it was all my fault and that I was an awful friend/housemate and it really shook my confidence. So now, I keep checking in with my partner. He's the first one I've properly lived with, and it's been a year now. It's been very peaceful and cozy. He says I make the house feel like a home. But somehow I can't keep shaking the feeling that I'm bad for him. 

I cry a lot and have panic attacks more regularly than I did for the couple of years before. Sometimes my anxiety comes as irritation and grumpiness. Most of the time I try to keep it contained but the other day I was too grumpy to play along with a joke and dismissed it too quickly. He got sad and apologised for pushing me and then I felt bad for making him feel bad - really felt like kicking a puppy! I explained I was just anxious about other things and that he had nothing to apologise for and that seemed okay but. I don't know. The persistent feeling that small moments like that might ruin the connection long-term or hurt him with my own damage continues to linger, however irrational it might be. Feels like I've forgotten how to vett irrational thoughts the way I used to.

Does anyone else get anxious living with a long term partner in a safe home? Or distrust reassurances, even though you have every reason and incentive to believe them that things really are okay? 

What helps you reconnect with trust and a sense of belief in yourself and others?"
Anxiety,My health anxiety is out of control,"Hello I hope I'm not bothering anyone here. I just want reassurance or advice, if someone else went through something like this.
 I'm feeling like I'm gonna die pretty soon, I have way too many symptoms.
My throat hurts sometimes, sometimes I feel I have something stuck there, and my voice gets weak 
Sometimes I spit out blood coming from the throat. (Might be irritated)
My gut is messed up. Hurts every day, comes and goes, but specially after eating it hurts and I feel nauseous. (I haven't thrown up even once, and my stool looks normal, no blood)
I have no energy at all these days, I feel like I'm shutting down. (It's too hot outside, and I haven't been sleeping well)
There's a mole on my armpit that I've had for years and it's always had a weird shape, but now I'm noticing some weird colors on it, like kinda pale at some parts. Never got itchy or hurt. Never got it checked out either.
I'm freaking out so bad. I feel like I have all kinds of cancer/tumors.

To make it worse, I currently don't have access to medical insurance and can't afford much. 
Been living under tremendous amounts of stress for the past year. Please help me. I'm desperate"
Anxiety,Anyone ever get warm sensations on your skin?," FYI, 41 male, I take 30mg Prozac(18 months), 200mg Wellbutrin(1 year ago), and 10mg Buspar(6 months ago) daily

For the past few months ive had this burning sensation come and go randomly on my left leg around my knee and calf. Not so much a tingling, more of the feeling as if you put IcyHot on it. Again, it comes and goes. Ive tried to notice a pattern of when i notice it and i know it happens more when im in a panic/anxiety situation.

I workout daily and am in very good shape. I will add I got shingles in my other leg around my right foot 18 months ago and still have nerve pain. Not sure if the two are connected."
Anxiety,I'm panicking about my dad's health,"My dad is alone right now while my mom visits family in the Philippines. My sister and I live across the country from him and none of us have heard from him since yesterday (usually he replies to calls/texts within 5-30 mins). 

Last my mom heard, he's been having headaches and has been sent to get a CT scan in another city. He's been prescribed steroids and he offhandedly mentioned something about a tumor but my mom doesn't know if he was joking or not... 

It's very very unusual for him not to communicate with any of us and I'm very anxious that something bad has happened."
Anxiety,Friend Anxiety,"I am not sure when it started, but I have major anxiety around my friends. I have been working on my sobriety on and off for about 2 years, and am sure this has something to do with it. BUT. I struggle socializing with my friends.. like we can have so much fun but I don't know what to talk about. People will crack jokes and i'll be so focused on acting normal and knowing how to respond that I can't even reply or reply awkwardly. People have always said i am 'awkward' but silences now stress me out. I find comfort topics and feel like i go to those every time when I talk to friends.. I am rambling but I have no idea what to do and how to relax.

side note: I'm on lexapro and have been for about a year."
Anxiety,People keep bullying me online,"I made some posts asking random questions and I get people basically saying “haha whiny bitch! Your feelings don’t matter and you’re just complaining!”

WTF?"
Anxiety,Went out last night and feel horrible,"So I went out with some work colleagues yesterday after work and one drink turned into many and we ended up staying out for a long time. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and often I’ll need a few drinks before I end up getting involved in conversations etc

I know I chatted a lot of utter nonsense whilst I was drunk and there’s a few holes in my memory and I just feel horrible, I feel like I’ve made a complete idiot of myself even though I know everyone else was drunk as well I can’t help feeling like everyone hates me and I’ve said something stupid.

This is one of the worst my anxiety’s ever ever been I just needed to vent somewhere but anyone with any tips on how to cool the anxiety down would help me a lot."
Anxiety,I am in the best mental space I have ever been in and I’m so surprised bc a year ago I couldn’t leave my house,"let me start this off by I AM SO GRATEFUL. Like mentally I have truly never been this better. 2 months ago I was edging calling a  hotline, and a year before that I was dealing with severe paranoia and anxiety and dealing with a domestic abuse household. (Plus many other things that are equally traumatizing). I would like to think that I slowly made myself get mentally healthier and that this wasn’t overnight.  And I mean I have a good understanding of temporary happiness, where your happiness is a symptom of good things happening to you. But this is different because something arguably bad happened to me, and I was able to express my emotions and move on from the situation and not let it fester and overthink the situation. I started working out earlier this month, and it wasn’t to fulfill body image issues I just like the way I feel after.(It also gives me a strong sense of self discipline that I enjoy) 
i am so happy I was able to work through my problems. I have dealt with a fair amount of adversity and when that happens you have such a narrow view on what happiness really is.
I hope this helps someone, I remember I would turn to Reddit whenever i felt like the stress and anxiety would never end"
Anxiety,Existential crisis,"It seems I’m having an existential crisis. What meaning does life have, does god exist, if god does exist why did he create us who created him, is heaven really what I want. Once we die is our free will taken if we do get into heaven will I truly be happy. If he’ll exist that’s not what I would want either. If reincarnation is it will I just endlessly live life never remembering the one before but if that’s the case then is living really special at all. If that’s the case there will never be an answer at the end of what life is. Even if I found the answer what could I do with it. If there is nothing at the end what was the point will I feel the eternal nothingness will my consciousness never exist? I’m not worried I’ll be forgotten but I’m scared I will never be able to experience life no matter how it comes. I know trying to find the answer behind creation is impossible, but just thinking about it continually how life came to be I can’t seem to get it out of my head. Of course I’ve always come to the conclusion that I can’t control it so whatever feels right has to be right and all I can do is live. Which worked for some time but recently my worries have only grown. Possibly because of my own personal failures in life. Did poorly in school 1 year of college and haven’t continued since I stopped, in and out of jobs, I feel like I do poorly in my relationships and then I think the solution is simply to change or find my passion and work toward it. But I resign myself and just continue to ponder and slowly but surely change. I’m 21 soon to be 22 and I guess I just want to know peoples thoughts about this."
Anxiety,Zoloft 25 mg,"I recently started Zoloft 25mg. I have terrible panic attacks and I’m extremely afraid of medication so the one thing that should help me also scares me so my doctor said I can start with 12.5 and work my way up. It’s day 4 and I took a little more than 12.5 and my anxiety is through the roof. I know this is a side effect, I’ve been reading so many other posts about this very thing from other people experiencing it but I just need to hear more success stories. It’s so hard to keep taking it knowing I’m basically throwing myself into a fire of panic just in hopes that in a few weeks I will be a normal functioning less anxious person. I will keep taking it but I’m just so exhausted of fighting these anxiety/panic attacks. This is my first time taking medicine and I do feel better for the most part, I wasn’t really feeling any side effects until today with the worst of all-increased anxiety. Please just reply with how long it took for your anxiety to lessen and just overall support. I’m asking for support in this post."
Anxiety,I feel dumb and silly… :(,"I have an issue I been smoking a ton of weed and well… it’s been helping except when I get way way too high…. 


Looks like 20 days ago from my post history i got anxious leaving my bag in a car for like 20m and I got anxious it was possible someone messed with my weed somehow.

I’m on Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines medication. They are only temporary and it’s frustrating. When the panic attack me, I cannot deal with this immense amount of fear and I am so done with this.
I attempted suicide 2 years ago and haven’t thought about it since then. 
I cannot stand this I am not even a Reddit user. I’m a new Canadian immigrant and most of my friends are in South Korea. I barely have friends here. I cannot live with this anymore"
Anxiety,How do you manage??,"Hey everyone 👋 hope everyone’s well and keeping safe. I’ve been struggling with my anxiety for all my adolescent years and early adult life ( only 21 ). Been diagnosed with GAD; worrying that I was gonna die in my sleep, panic attacks every day with severe chest pain which always resulted me convincing myself I was having a heart attack;  I couldn’t function as a human being.  

Been put on the medication escltalopram and things have been a lot more calmer; no panic attacks; no obsessive thoughts as such, can breath again without feeling like I was being suffocated. 

But even though I’m a lot better I still have my bad days; I feel like everything’s crashing around me; I’m going to lose everything etc does anyone have these sorts of days if so how do you manage? I’ve tried meditation, yoga, relaxing music but my mind won’t be quiet. It goes a 100 miles per hour. 


Please be kind I’m a sensitive soul 😂"
Anxiety,Should I take SSRI?,"Hello, I’m 25 years old male European. My doctor said yesterday that I have anxiety neurosis and hypochondria, I feel pain in my right stomach side, under the rib, sometimes lower, sometimes on the back but always on the right side. I thought it could something serious, googled symptoms (from cancer to cancer, if not this one, than maybe another one), had anxiety attacks (scared of death), had endoscopy, morphology, liver and pancreas blood tests, on Monday I’ll have ultrasound of my stomach (had one 9 months ago that didn’t show anything to worry about), but he pain is there and I focus only on this pain. I’m nervous and explosive. I could try to use some herbal medicine and change my mind now that I know I have this”mental disorder”. Are the SSRI safe and worth it? How long must someone use them after curing the problem? I have inflamed lower throat where it connects to the esophagus - doc told me it’s reflux (but I read that neurosis and anxiety can also cause reflux like symptoms). Thanks in advance."
Anxiety,My Heart beats and it beats and it just keeps increasing,"Whenever I get anxious and it's like a loop , meditation and all never works at that point of time and it hurts more when there's no one to listen too or I can share with .

Everything is great, genuinely, I feel that I’m living my best life, doing a job I love and things are where I want them to be. So why do I wake up at 3am panicking about work?

I think about things that don’t even exist…non-problems that my brain merrily turns into problems that then makes my breathing short and gives me that cold water feeling down my back…at 3am…when I can’t do anything about it. 
It then means that I don’t sleep properly, and then when I wake up and think about my day ahead I feel worried and tired and breathless. 
I get to work, everything is fine. Problems are easily solvable, nobody is putting excess pressure on me or expecting me to produce a miracle. So why the anxiety? Ask my brain."
Anxiety,Can yout period make your anxiety/ocd stronger?,
Anxiety,i don't even know who i am,"long rant incoming, im sorry. basically i hate myself, i hate everything about myself. i've been shamed and sheltered from doing simple things growing up that now i'm afraid of everything and everyone. i just had very little guidance growing up and i feel like its coming to beat my ass now. i sound like an idiot when i talk to people or do anything, i feel so inept. Im so hyperaware of how awkward i am and i hate it. Im constantly thinking about how others percieve me. It seems like some people like me and being friends with me so i guess i dont have it that bad. But i get so nervous and scared around my OWN friends. I have no confidence and my trust in others is so bad. All i can think about is negative. Maybe because i feel so dishonest myself, i expect dishonesty and distrust from others as well. I have no idea what my personality really is. I feel so fake. Im so hateful, bitter, judgemental, which i try my best to hide. and im a giant fucking pussy. i wish everyone would just forget about me. It sucks because i hate being lonely and i crave friendship but i just feel too stupid and scared to be my ""true self"". I dont even know what my ""true self"" is.. i think my true self is just ""scared"". this was long and probably makes no sense, im sorry"

Anxiety,Still struggle with heart health anxiety after multiple tests.,"I’ve gotten 5 ecg’s,multiple blood tests,echocardiogram and excercise stress test done. All came out good and they tell me I have a healthy heart. Yesterday they measured my blood pressure and it was very high with a heart beat of only 49 which made me go in a panick attack ( I do take bisoprolol to keep my blood pressure low and maybe it has something to do with that on top of stress) . I just can’t lose the feeling my heart is about to give up on me at 26 years old. So scared of getting cardiac arrest while I got so many tests done that surely something would pop up if I had an underlying problem. My days are just filled with anxiety and I don’t see it getting better. Feeling tingling in my chest,contractions and a bruised feeling. Normally heartrate is from 60-75 but I’m just so very scared it consumes me and my life."

Anxiety,Any stories about getting back together after breaking up &amp; anxious partner doing counselling?,"Hi. My partner recently ended our long-term relationship at the height of anxiety (looked like he was panicking and was impulsive). He is not regretting it so far. Near-breakups happened several times in the past but this is our first break up. (Near-breakups started with having a break for a while because he wasn’t sure if I was the one or the relationship was the right one, but then he always came back feeling determined that I was the one, he loved me so much, and it was anxiety that was doing terrible things.)

He had several counselling sessions before, even though he claimed them to be useless. But this time, he is motivated to go counselling to sort things out by himself. He says “this is my problem”.

He doesn’t know if we eventually get back together and doesn’t want to give me false hope, but he “cares a lot about” me and told me to contact him anytime if I want. He appreciates my support and understanding of him.

I know things are different from one couple to another and nobody can say for sure what happens next to us, but is he likely to come back? I guess I want to hear good stories about how counselling made your mind clear about the importance of your relationship and made you see that your relationship is worth pursuing."
Anxiety,I was going so good without having anxiety over anything….,"But once I see this white thing in my cut on my finger in the shower, I immediately thought ‘shit it’s pus... it’s probably infected… I probably have sepsis’.

Now I feel sick to my gut and I feel anxious that I do have sepsis. If anything, the white thing was probably a little bit of soap, as there is no pus now. Plus I cut my finger on like… tuesday so that was a few days ago now, so I assume pus would’ve come up then? The cut is not hot to touch (or around it) so I assume I’m fine?

I shouldn’t have googled… I’m so anxious now. I haven’t worried about my health in months :("
Anxiety,Are SSRIs worth it if it causes you insomnia,"I can’t get past the first few days of taking SSRIs (citalopram) due to the insomnia it causes. My mind races and I genuinely don’t sleep.

Anxiety,i’m crying on the train,"I’m listening to “the scientist” by coldplay. “No one ever said it would be this hard.” I burst into tears immediately.

I was the whole time wondering if i’d live like that for the rest of my life. There would always be racing thoughts in my uncontrollable mind."
Anxiety,Was doing well with depression but an opponent in an online game really messed me up,"I was playing a really popular online FPS (not giving it away because I want extra anonymity and it doesn't matter anyway) and I was playing pretty okay: not my best nor my worst. I got some kills in and two of them were of one player.

Later they finally got a kill on me when I approached two enemies alone. I was like ""whatever"" because I admittedly walked into that, it was 2v1, and I knew that I wasn't playing at my best that game. But then the one player proceeded to teabag me for a relative while (a solid 5 seconds). Not even their other teammate joined in.

I've only been teabagged a handful of times over my collective 3 years of playing the game-mostly bc I play console-and it's only ever gotten me annoyed at most. But for some reason, it was different this time.

It genuinely hurt me because I literally did not do *anything* to the player and it was so fast and aggressive, as if they really wanted to insult me. Plus, it was a sneaky kill and I didn't even see them, so not necessarily something to gloat about.

After watching a replay of our match, it may have seemed like I was targeting them because only *I* ever killed then, but even then I only killed them twice (they hid from my team for most of the game). I killed their teammates almost an equal amount of times. They did not act like this to anyone else and if anything, they would always go to damage ME whenever they had a choice. I just felt so targeted.

I did get my revenge, but I had to go a little out of my way to do it. When I did kill them they typed (basically) ""what a good job helping your team"" Later, both our teams were attacking each other equally and they got a kill off me because of it and then they teabagged me AGAIN even though I literally was not even paying attention to them nor attacking them. Like, why so agro? They had a personal vendetta against me or something.

On the game's subreddit it seems to be split 60/40 between people who think teabagging is just a light-hearted joke/a strategy to deliberately tilt opponents or just straight-up BM respectively. So it feels like I'm being too sensitive about it and I should just shut up because ""it's just pixels and how can pixels be offensive?""

I know this is a very small incident, but it really did affect me a lot and I don't even know why. I've never been the target of a chat insult before, so I guess the criticism just freaked me out (combined with their behavior toward me in-game). It ruined the rest of my night. I honestly forgot about my good games afterward until writing this now. I haven't gotten depressed for a little bit. Why did this have to bring it back?
So, am I being too sensitive? How do I just let this kind of stuff go?"
Anxiety,Is it normal to not do anything on day offs?,"I work currently (internship). So i am pretty much occupied in the week. On weekends i don’t have much to do currently. So i stay at home, watch things i like, go out for walks, read books (tbh i need to read more, during college my capability to read books decreased for some reason), clean and vibe alone. Is that weird? My colleagues who are older than me always got a lot to do on weekends. Now i feel weird about that. 

Would you consider what i described as bizarre? I don’t like hanging out with people as that exhausts the shit out of me. I live in a village type of area so there isn’t much to do."
Anxiety,"Advise on undiagnosed ""loud sound"" anxiety.","On a trip with the family in New Orleans. During the day its fine. People walking to work. People being tourists normal. But I knew I was sensitive to competing voices/music/sound (i didnt have this as a child or in my early 20s- new thing). Didn't want to be a ""bummer"" night one as we walked Bourbon St (rows of bars and noise), but I did end up leaving early - Saying I was tired. The other night we went to Arnaulds (sp?) Very nice restaurant closed in with a lot of people in the limited space, very loud and many conversations, and staff coming up behind to give you plates or ask how your doing (startling me many times). 

I left the building once to get air and quiet. Second time out was when I thought I could brave it out but reached the point of heavier breathing and crying so family noticed. I managed to stick around until dessert (a fancy fire show - didn't want to be a bummer) and when I finally left, it was much the same of breathing and crying. 

To explain it the loud competing sounds I dislike. Too much to focus on. Too Loud. 

My friend with a different anxiety says her therapist recommends ice in the palm. Grounds you. Any other ideas or coping mechanisms? At least until I can make it home and talk to someone. (Didn't realize how bad it was.)"

Anxiety,Should I switch therapist?,"As the title suggests, but some background info on my situation.

I've had a hard time finding a therapist for over 2 years with through my primary doctor and insurance. Everytime I told them I needed help I never got assigned to anyone. I would call multiple offices and never got a reply back. I felt very alone and desperate during this time without having anyone to talk to.

I was finally able to make appointments with a therapist through my school's sources and it went really well. She helped me organize my life. I didn't really know how to deal with my stress and anxiety and she showed me how to tackle my problems one step at a time. In a way, it felt like I was being coached for a sport. She set-up a plan of for me to follow and it was very straightforward. Every week we would set a goal and I was suppose to reach it. If I didn't we would go over what went wrong and how I we could ""win"" the next time. We started with first figuring out my triggers, followed by figuring out how to ease stressful situations, then by learning how to avoid those triggers all together. 

It was very methodical. Everytime I felt lost, she would not only help through my problems, but also teach me how our minds work and why we respond the way we do. This teach and practice method of tackling stress/anxiety helped me a lot. 

The next step she was going to teach me is how to confront my fears and learn to live with them. She said it was the next BIG step, but I would have to continue this process with the next therapist, since I wouldn't be able to see her anymore.

When I graduated I was no longer able to be her patient anymore. She is only available through the school and I'm not a student anymore. She told me to explain to the next therapist what I had learned and gone through so that my next therapist could pick off where I left off. She explained to me that each therapist is different and that I should be open to new ideas. I was okay with all of this, provided I would be able to go on to the next step which is facing my fears that cause me stress a.d anxiety. 

I wanted to continue to progress and learn how to manage my anxiety. Just like how an athlete continues to evolve their skills to better prepare themselves for a game. 

I was able to find a new therapist and on the first day I explained to her all of this. My new therapist thanked me for the explanation and said she could help me continue to progress. 

However, ever since I started seeing my new therapist (also a woman) she hasn't helped me progress. I'm back at square one where she keeps asking me how my week has been and how to recognize stress triggers. I don't have in person consultations with her and instead I have them over a video call. 

Often times she is distracted and won't be listening or interrupts me and then leaves the room for multiple periods of time. She talks for extended periods of time with no point to her story and I honestly don't feel like she's helping me in any aspect.

I guess it's nice to have someone listen to me when I've had a bad week. However, I've learned previously with the school counselor how to deal with anxiety so these talks don't really do anything for me. On the contrary I feel like they waste my time because I want to progress rather than stay in the same spot.

I've confronted her before about how she sometimes wastes time and she's apologized and then I'm able to get a bit of new teachings. But this keeps happening. I'm tired of having to remind her that she's being rude by constantly leaving and not listening. My thought is that why even bother asking me ""how I'm doing"" if she isn't going to be paying attention.

She seems nice enough, but Im not getting the help I need or want. Should I change therapist? Should I just keep trying to tell her that sometimes she comes off as being rude? I don't want to be without a therapist again for 2 years, but I don't feel like I'm going anywhere right now with my current therapist."
Anxiety,Anxious about weekend trip with new boyfriend,"This is really just a venting post. I'm going to a waterpark with a guy I've been seeing for 2 months and I'm kinda terrified. I've never gone on a trip with someone else, let one in a new relationship. I'm also nervous about how I look. I have lots of scars, cellulite, and acne. So. Much. Acne. And yes he has seen me naked and without makeup before, but usually at night when its darker so I feel more hidden. and right now I'm having and acne flare so it's even worse and there is no way to cover it up cause I'll be swimming, so I have to feel ugly in front of him and the entire park. I'm also just nervous but I'm not like madly into him, and I know itll just be a short term relationship, so I'm hoping this weekend doesnt make me totally hate him lol, I'm so in my head about this, I haven't slept tonight and there only 4 hours til we leave so I really wont be getting any sleep."

When I have constipation I try to increase fiber, but that doesn't seem to help?   Seems to be my anxiety and stress levels that cause more constipation.....

anyone find something that works for constipation since I cant' really relieve anxiety more......years of therapy and different meds etc....(no meds aren't the constipation cause I have had it before and after them).

applesauce seems to help and raisin nut bran ......but makes a mess of IBS etc.........and seems to worsen GAD and OCD symptoms #fun"

Anxiety,Weird anxiety involving blue clear skies,"I in recent years developed this weird anxiety when there are clear blue skies with no clouds. I feel like im super exposed and that im conscious of the millions of billions of miles of nothing above and around me and i start to feel paralyzed and scared and clutching myself. I imminently want to get to some structure or indoors when this happens. I almost get this sense like im staring into abyss and its staring back, or if im not looking at it but aware of it that its looking at me. Whenever its cloudy or a rainy day i feel none of this. It only occurs in open blue skies and especially when im in an open environment away from immediate structures or tree's. I try to remain calm and sort of have to on the outside and try to not let it show to those around me when it happens and often just use some excuse to get inside. Yet if its a heavily cloudy day i dont feel this way. I've tried to look it up online but to no avail. Has anyone else had or know this type of anxiety?"

Anxiety,I'm paranoid people are out to get me or hurt me... How do I stop these intrusive thoughts?,"I've been emotionally hurt in the past by people who have disappointed me and let me down. Basically friends who are two-faced or have hidden motives with me. I've felt so powerless and defenseless in those situations in the past because it's usually 5 or 6 of them against me. It's been tough to feel SAFE in my own apartment and even, my body. As a result , I noticed I've been avoiding meeting new people and giving older friends a chance. SO I went out with a friend the other day and the hangout was a bit weird. She wasn't being completely direct with me and even hit on me... kept asking if I liked her... and it just threw me through a whole loop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think much of it in the hangout and laughed it off as I was driving home....but then the next day the intrusive thoughts showed their ugly head. I started getting superrrrr anxious about her coming after me or her Ex (who never liked me in the past by the way) would come after me if she found out we hung out. And I just feel... afraid to even be in my own home. All this from one stupid hangout. How do I cope with these thoughts that I KNOW are absurd and unlikely? I don't want to resort to distancing myself from others again because that's not how I want to live my life. I don't wanna hide myself. Sometimes I feel like I dim my own light to let others shine just so that I can stay out of spotlight... if that even made sense. I'd appreciate any and all advice! thank you."
Anxiety,undescribable discomfort when drinking water and eating food. could be anxiety related.,"I always get this pretty painful and distracting discomfort whenever I drink water and when I sometimes eat, for example I'll feel:

Sharp pain on the right side of my back, pain when sometimes swallowing non-soft foods (I can almost feel it going down my chest) same thing happens with water, discomfort around my stomach area, a knot feeling around my chest especially when I'm sitting or laying down, drinking water will also cause a brief moment of breathlessness (also causes shortness of breath when laying down), uncomfortable bloating, lots of belching during and after meals.

Anxiety,Anxiety attacks about work,"Almost everyday before work , I have so much anxiety, especially when it’s a full shift. My chest is tight, I feel very nauseous and I shit myself more than 5 times. Sometimes I have to leave my desk and cry, and I even self sabotage with work avoidance every now and then, but it’s honestly because I’m about to explode in those moments.

My job is not even that bad, my manager is supportive, and the benefits are the best I’ve ever had. I went part time for a year since last March &amp; it was still kind of stressful, but manageable. After a year part time, I’ve lost my benefits and had to go back to 40 hours as I need the insurance for therapy where my therapist is recommending I seek out a PCP also because we’re suspecting I likely have ADHD &amp; my therapist thinks I need medication to help with my executive dysfunction which makes my anxiety worse.

In the meantime I am drowning. I used over 40 hours to take off last month and am almost out of time my anxiety is skyrocketing. I don’t know what to do and am hanging on by a thread as I try and make it 2 weeks till my next therapy appointment and 1 month almost till I meet with a PCP. My therapist tells me take it 1 day at a time, but I have so little time in my day after work and that makes me feel so trapped and like an impending cloud of terror is always following. I need the job for insurance to get better, but I’m struggling so much to work the job. I feel like shit because this is all in my head but I’m physically sick everyday I have to work a full shift

How do you guys make it through each day? I don’t know if this was a rant or if I’m looking for help, but I feel so lost and overwhelmed having to mask at work when I’m struggling immensely mentally"
Anxiety,buspirone is a trip,"so,
started buspirone 5mg 2x a month ago. tried to to off it because I felt strange/more dissociated. only lasted a day or two because then I convinced myself that the wearing off was giving me dissociation as well, so I started it again. dissociated WORSE and couldn’t stay awake. I don’t even remember yesterday for the most part lmfao. feeling better this morning but SHAKY and like I can’t move off my couch. doctor won’t prescribe me anything besides hydroxyzine- I don’t want to SLEEP, I just want my thoughts to chill w/o me dissociating.

Anxiety,COVID anxiety,"Warning: gross things like vomit and illness are talked about.  
 
I'm having combined depression/anxiety around COVID. My anxiety usually spikes around things that have happened- like if I hadn't gotten sick for 2 weeks and coughed until I threw up ( and I'm boosted) I wouldn't be so anxious around work super spreaders, mask optional doctors offices, etc. ( theres also work- children coughing blood, kids so ill the parent was scared for their life) There's no seeming reason for my lack of immunity- my immune system just says "" nope we're being sick for weeks now"". I take vitamins, I try to exercise, but I fear I'll be sick for a month each year or worse when they give up worse  and we won't even have the pills to give anybody.

Like, when I think about my future now I end up thinking 'this is what I'm going to do... IF I make it back.' It's so annoying because I know all of those things are incredibly unlikely, but I can't get over the fact that they COULD happen. 

Any advice appreciated :)"

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.** 

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  


**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  


● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  


**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**"
Anxiety,Feel like I can't breathe on and off,"I've been having episode where I feel like I can't breathe right. I try to change position and I feel better. This episodes kept coming back , is this anxiety? I'm worried about it. I dealt with it in the past but it went away on its own now it's back"
Anxiety,Help - sounds make me overwhelmed with anxiety,"I don't even know where to start. When I was a kid I would start crying whenever there was live music. Loud sounds made me panic. 

I still hate loud sounds. Sometimes I have to ask my family to turn the radio volume down in car, and it annoys my siblings. When someone speaks loudly, it physically hurts my ears and makes me wince. I absolutely hate it when people speak over each other or over loud music or whatever. Then they'll catch me grimacing in discomfort and they think I hate their voice. This is why I don't want to tell anyone to stop talking so loud. 

Someone does the dishes loudly? Awful. Someone drops something on the floor? Horrible. The worst was when I lived in the middle of a renovation. I felt like I was about to explode.

Nowadays, even smaller sounds make me want to cry. Chewing or drinking loudly, cracking knucles or spines, yikes. I can't even count how many times I've had to hold myself from having a full breakdown bc of the noise around me. It's ridiculous, but sounds and noises are one of my worst anxiety triggers at the moment.

Is there any solution or even help for this? I'm seriously thinking about buying sound-proof wireless headphones :/"
Anxiety,[anxiety] (13 agender) feel out of place with my friends,"I have severe social anxiety and dont like hanging out with big groups of people. Last night I had a sleepover with my girlfriends, it was fun but I felt a little bit out of place. Today me and two other girls went to market street to just hang out and have fun. Me and my friends went into a clothing store and they started trying things on, I wanted to but then I just decided not to because i was worried about how i would look. Now we are going to get lunch and I want to be more open but dont really know how. I’ve asked my mom to get me a therapist so I can talk to someone but it hast happened yet. I am always close with my friends in school but dont really go with them outside for fear of them being judgy.
I just want to be able to actually hang out without being worried. Any recommendations on smoothening could do?"

Anxiety,I No Longer Find Comfort In Albert Camus,"Brief note: I should have chosen a less concerning username. Whatever.  


I am cognizant that the title and subject matter might not seem to have much to do with anxiety. Formerly, I found some comfort in Albert Camus' The Myth Of Sisyphus. At least, I found comfort in the summary that other people offered. That summary being that humans attempt to find meaning will inevitably fail, but that we will always, or must always, strive to seek new meaning, new purpose, whatever. I found comfort in the phrase \*il faut imaginer Sisyphe heureux\*. I found comfort until I actually read some of \*The Myth Of Sisyphus\*.  
Before I read some of the excerpts, I had been looking at Jordan B. Peterson's ideology (it's pure shit. He uses so many words to say so little that his philosophy in itself is a major driver of the decline in the value of meaning). The problem I ran into, feel free to eviscerate me, is that Camus is not much better. His words look pretty, but seem to be devoid of any actual substance. It's all fluff. The only philosopher from whom I still derive any comfort is Sartre. I read Existentialism Is A Humanism and I read Nausea. Anyways."

Anxiety,"Im having Globus Sensation like crazy and it only goes away when I drink alcohol, any similar stories?","About a month ago I came down with what I think was just a regular ol’ cold. Then I had about a week of complete relief and I thought I could get back to exercising (I’m an avid runner, 25-30 miles a week, sub 20 5k’s) so I consider myself healthy, I get blood work every year and I’m always in the clear save for a vit D deficiency. Anyway, after that week of relief I went to a show and woke up the next morning with the worst sore throat I’ve ever had. In particular, it felt like I was being stabbed in one specific location with a thumbtack whenever I drank cold liquids (food went down fine no issues).


Went to an ENT, they saw nothing and in the same day I got a call from my PC physician who told me I tested positive for strep. Too on antibiotics and the pain is gone. However, I did myself the misfortune I googling my symptoms and convinced myself I have esophageal cancer in the most upper part of my esophagus. So once the pain stopped I have the worst globus sensation now. Food goes down fine but immediately after I eat I feel like there’s a huge chunk stuck in my throat and like there’s a lump in there. Water doesn’t help. 

But whenever I have a couple of beers the whole thing goes away- what the fuck?"
Anxiety,Anxiety over new dog and transitions (please help!!),"Hi all! First time poster on the sub. My partner and I recently lost our previous dog, and it was a rough go having him. We adopted him when he was 15 (we were told he was 10) and he had kidney disease and arthritis pretty much the entire time we had him. He had to be hospitalized at one point, and only lived with us for 1.5 years, during which our entire lives pretty much revolved around getting him care, keeping weight on him, and trying to navigate regular old dog issues. 

My partner really benefits from having a pet, so I agreed to another, even though I didn't really want one. I did say no more seniors and relatively low maintenance (and no puppies!). We adopted a dog yesterday, and she's sweet and scared. I'm definitely anxious and struggling with the transition of our lifestyles (it'll be harder to do some of things we were doing in the in-between of having dogs, like staying out with friends longer than planned) as well as feeling really anxious that we're going to have another dog with a lot of medical needs. She's heartworm positive, so the rescue is paying for the treatment, but it will require 8 weeks of crate rest. She has itchy skin and fur patches, and we don't know if it's allergies or something else. She got spayed a few days ago and is now having vaginal discharge and struggling somewhat to pee. So we have to take her to the urgent care vet later today. We've only had her one day and already so many things are happening and I'm so stressed out. 

Plus she's sweet but stays close to us, and had to be bribed and almost pushed to go into her crate last night. She slept in it well, but I'm super nervous that she's gonna have separation anxiety, and my partner and I both work outside the home during the day. We won't know until Tuesday when we leave, but we are gonna try to trial little bits of time and see how she does.

It took me months to bond with our last dog, and I know it's going to take a long time for it to happen this time too, and it's just hard to be staring months of anxiety down. It's all just a lot and I'm trying to not show that I'm too anxious because my partner feels bad about me feeling bad, but I just feel so tired and exhausted already. 

Is there anything I can do to try to reframe my mindset a little or make the transition easier?"
Anxiety,Anyone else?,"Most of the time (well not most, it is something that I have confirmed switching my expectations on and off) is that I am the happier when I assume and admit that evrything is going to go to shit and death or sadness is the only certainty, as if any instance of happiness is appreciated and if it blows up in my face is no biggie because I had already set myself up for ""humbling"" from the get go.

When I try to be motivated and happy the rushing thoughts come in, my OCD flares up, my brain starts to get tense and I get ice picks... i dont know if you guys have any tips for rewiring this catasthropizing that my brain loves to pursue as a personal sport."
Anxiety,Smoking ouid makes me feel normal,"I feel the switch between how I normally am and how I am once whatever the ducks happening in my brain is temporarily fixed.

Everything about myself that I like is able to flow out of me because I’m not constantly second guessing everything. I feel like I’m an actual human. Im more creative, I understand myself better, I find conversations way easier, I even initiate conversations with strangers. 

I’ve made meaningful connections while high and the fact that it’s been so beneficial to me is unnerving. I say that because I know I’d be willing to sacrifice a lot for all the good it does me."

Anxiety,Dealing with possible hypochondria,"Hi. 

I'm in need of an advice. 

So, I suffer of generalized anxiety disorder, meaning I get anxious from all sort of normal stuff, but most often, it's of something that may but does not have to be abnormal... Meaning, my health.

Whenever I feel ""odd"" and not 100%, I worry -- Is something wrong with me? Should I go see my GP? If yes, what am I gonna tell them? ""Hey doc, something may or may not be okay with me, can you give me a whole look over, like, complete, skeletal, muscular, neural, immunological, nutritional, mental and other checkups?""

Sadly, most of these less than specific issues usually result in ""Well, we can't tell for certain, but we'll take a few fluid samples, an ECG and maybe an EEG and if everything's okay... Tough luck""

I had one scare when my heart was skipping a beat several times a day, so I got a mobile ECG device, managed to record it, showed it to my doc and was told that hey - that is nothing life threatening.

Since then, I've been calm about my heart, but now I'm all anxious about my brain. I don't have a history of like... Strokes in my family, but one never knows for sure, and getting an MRI anytime one feels ""off"" is not practical.

Is there a way anyone here learned to deal with these sorts of panics that something irreparable is going down and might cost them their life and/or health? I hate anxiety, and the only time I manage to calm down is when someone distracts me irl, and that isn't always an option."

Anxiety,Simple game about anxiety that I wanted to share,"I wanted to share this because I found it a little while back and it helped change my perspective on my anxiety a bit

It's called, Adventures with Anxiety: [https://ncase.me/anxiety/](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)

I'll add a trigger warning here just in case: it touches on self medicating with alcohol and it brings up common anxiety fears. That being said, its still pretty tame overall.

You don't need to pay anything to play, it's just a browser game and its pretty short but I found it insightful and it made me see my anxiety differently. So now instead of always feeling scared of it and hating it, I can sometimes take a step back and understand that ultimately its just trying to keep me safe and warn me of things, even if it is misguided and overdramatic. I hope those of you that play it get something positive out of it like me :&gt;"
Anxiety,What to do about a bee/wasp phobia?,"I have a really bad bee/wasp phobia. For years, every time the nice weather comes around, it makes me afraid to go outside. Even just letting the dogs out into the yard becomes a trial. And if I think I hear a buzz or something that could sound like a bee, even if I'm inside my own house, I go into defense mode and do things like put my head down or put my hand on my head. If I'm outside, especially if I'm alone, it's just a constant danger zone. And every year it just keeps getting worse. I've tried CBT, I've tried exposure therapy and neither worked in the slightest. Currently trying hypnotherapy (as in, I saw a hypnotherapist and I now have a recording I'm supposed to listen to for three weeks), and if that doesn't work, shit, I dunno what I'm gonna do, even my therapist is out of ideas. Thought I'd ask here on reddit on the off chance that somebody has done something that has worked that I haven't thought of, cuse I'm really desperate at this point. I just want to be able to go outside and not feel constant fear, maybe even enjoy it a little. 

PS, I do have GAD, as well as ADHD, autism, and mild OCD, if any of that is relevant."
Anxiety,Chest pains,"Been having chest pains on both sides of my chest, I don't believe it's cardiac related as it hasn't spread anywhere, but it's been scaring the hell out of me. Just wanted to know if anyone else has ever felt something like this and how bad it got."
Anxiety,Anxiety medication,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety for over two years now. I go to therapy, but since there are a lot of things happening in my life, it doesn't really work. I have school, work and many other things that i have to prioritise over my mental health. I have lse very bad somatic symptoms such as dizzines, nausea (i tend to eat very little because of it), heart palpitations, chest pain, headache, I often feel weak and tired, numbing / weak hands etc. - there are many other that mostly come out during my attacks. I am wondering if medication would at least help with the somatic symptoms on top on therapy and if there are many side effects of it. :)"
Anxiety,can severe anxiety be helped naturally?,"my anxiety has gotten to the point where I have attacks just randomly, sitting at home, no triggers. I cannot drive a car anymore and I can’t even go into the grocery store without having minor attacks. has anyone with severe anxiety successfully lessened it naturally? I do have a prescription for medication but I’m hoping I could lessen the effects in a natural way."

Anxiety,Xanax and Alcohol?,"Alcohol and Xanax?

Anxiety,New fear unlocked,"My dad said he’d kick me out if I didn’t do as he told. I don’t think he meant it, just was trying to “motivate” me or something. It triggered me causing me to have a panic attack and I had to call beyond blue to calm down. First time I’ve ever done that and I can’t believe how much it helped. 

But what he said unlocked a new fear in me. What would I do if he kicked me out? And I’ve spent the last two hours thinking about what I would do. I fell asleep but now I can’t go back to sleep without thinking you wouldn’t have enough for rent. And then my brain counters back I’ve calculated this and I could probably survive off what I have for 2 months not including my pay check. And it’s just a back and forth. 

My psychologist said I can’t fixate on things like this but it’s so hard when it’s something concerning my stability. I feel like he’s shattered my trust in having a home, something that always grounded me even if he didn’t mean it. 

I looked into it and I know for a fact I would be ok. Might dent into my savings but I would make it out alright. I am just terrified of having the rug pull out from under me. I am trying to stop thinking these things knowing nothing good will come out of it but I think I fed into this idea too much."
Anxiety,Anticipatory Anxiety,"How do you cope/deal with anticipatory anxiety? I can handle it usually once I know what’s going on… and before someone begins. However… the middle, the unknown of waiting for an answer is debilitating for me.

- Waiting on medical test results 
- Waiting to hear back on something important 
- Waiting for a judgement or court decision 
- Waiting to find out if you got the job after an interview

Any strategies you use that work? 

TLDR: How do you handle anticipation ?"
Anxiety,Embracing Anxiety,"That’s it. I’m done letting anxiety run my life. Anxious about driving? Oh well, still driving. Anxious about my heart/health? Well I’m still breathing. Anxious when I first wake up? Good morning to you too anxiety. 

Instead of trying to fight off this anxiety I am going to welcome it and share space with it. I will talk to it and remind myself that meh, it’s just what I deal with on a daily basis, might as well make friends with it. 

I’m not giving up, I’m just choosing not to fight with it anymore. Anxious or not, I’m going to do whatever I want to do. If it wants to be with me every step of the way, fine. Nothing is going to stop me🤘"

Right now I feel to anxious to take it (I want to make clear I completely appreciate the irony of being too anxious to take anxiety medication). Please be totally honest, I want to take it I seriously need the help, my OCD is ruining my life and I cannot even function, if I do not take this I will also be letting everyone down as I have been trying to get any medication for a long time.

Anxiety,Being alone makes my health anxiety worse,"I constantly worry about my health and I jump to conclusions when symptoms appear. Yesterday I was having a very normal day and I suddenly developed sharp chest/back pain and pain while breathing. I spent some time trying to figure out what was going on and nothing seemed to help. This pain came out of nowhere and I don't think it was anxiety induced. I ended up going to the hospital for the first time in over ten years because I've never experienced chest pain like that and was worried about my heart.

All of the tests and scans came back negative (good news) but my blood pressure was through the roof, most likely due to the anxiety and stress of being in a hospital. I was there all night and all I could think about was how difficult it is as someone with anxiety to deal with health issues when there's no one to talk me down or reassure me that things are fine when I'm jumping to the worst case scenario for every little thing.

I feel embarrassed that I wasted the hospital's time and resources for a mystery medical episode that ended with no conclusive results. Although I now feel more reassured about my health, I'm currently stressing out over the astronomical hospital bill I'm going to receive soon."
Anxiety,Brain fog for months straight,"Hi everyone, 

I am a young adult who has suffered from social anxiety, health anxiety, GAD, and ADHD my entire life. Recently I have been experiencing severe brain fog for months straight. To be honest, it kind of feels like I'm stoned at all times - but this definitely isn't the case, as I gave up smoking marijuana months ago, in an attempt to help reduce this feeling. I feel so much pressure in my eyes at all times, and I am spacey, forgetful, and constantly tired. This began about 3 months ago, and has hardly improved since. 

I am both medicated and in CBT. My therapist agrees that the root cause of this is almost definitely anxiety. Due to my health anxiety, I think I'm trapping myself in a cycle. The more I worry about it, the worse it gets, and I've been trapped in this headspace for months.  It is starting to take a toll on my daily life and is causing me extreme stress. 

Has anyone here experienced debilitating brain fog caused by their anxiety, and if so, what have you done to reduce the feeling and make peace with it?"
Anxiety,i’m too scared to see my boyfriend,isn’t it ironic. i love my boyfriend as much as someone my age can really “love” (16yo gay M) but i get extremely anxious when i want to see him and lately it’s been preventing me from seeing him all together although when i’m with him he helps me so much with my anxiety and depression and it feels so good to be with him and cuddle heaps. i just want the anxiety to go away so i can see him i just feel like i’m losing momentum.
Anxiety,Constant sense of dread,"TW: Uvalde

I have this feeling of constant dread. I do have General Anxiety Disorder, but it hasn't felt like this before. My car was repossessed on Monday. I mostly felt numb and started looking for a way to fix the issue. Then on Tuesday, the Uvalde shooting happened and I spent a couple of hours watching the news footage. That's when the dread started. I constantly feel like I'm going to get in trouble at work or fired, even though I'm doing a good job and have a good relationship with my manager. I went to some bad credit card dealerships today and didn't have any luck (I went in super pessimistic). I've also been really sick recently. I may have to start biking to work, which is 4 miles, but my asthma is severely uncontrolled and I'm pretty heavy, so I'm not sure I can do it. I'm dreading that too. Last night my sister messaged me that she wants to talk to me about a couple of things, which usually means she's staging some kind of intervention or wants to tell me that she can't hang out with me until my mental health and finances are better (so her own mental health isn't affected, but I still think it's cruel). I'm avoiding calling her. I do have a therapist, but I'm having trouble booking an appointment with him because my boss is only sending out my schedule one week at a time and he's booked further than that. I also have an anxiety medication (buspirone) that I've been out of. I was able to get more today and plan to immediately start taking it. I guess I'm looking for advice to get rid of this feeling. I know tricks for acute panic or anxiety, like deep breathing, identifying objects around me, etc, but this is lasting longer than that."
Anxiety,I almost always feel embarrassed after social interactions,"Ive been struggling with anxiety for about as long as i can remember but never really came to this sub reddit. I think today was the hardest I’ve ever felt this way in a long time. Today i had my first day at an acting class and for 3 hours we played games where we all introduced each other and all the classic theatre kid stuff. The point is, in the moments that i was in the spotlight during the games i feel like i just made a fool of myself. I was so anxious that I feel like I acted stupid or maybe my anxiety makes me overthink how I acted. I cant tell. Maybe both. I experienced this before sometimes even with family I’ve seen before. Today was especially rough. Just needed to vent to someone. Didn’t feel like talking to any friends yet. Thanks"

I will need another teeth done too for veneers, crowns and implants, root canals redone because of inflammations.  I wasnt able to have braces and chose this option and now I suffer from it. How do I deal with this and my other teeth problems. I know many people do veneers, or other extensive treatment on teeth because they didnt want braces or because they need it for other reasons. Why it affects me so much? I think of it all days for one year already. It seems I am obsessed. Maybe because my mother already had rotten teeth at my age (36) and I used to hear that all the time from my grandmother when I was little? I am on Lexapro 10mg but it doesnt help it. :("

- Feeling very cold suddenly for short amounts of time (not even a few seconds)
- Shakiness and instability 
- finding it a little harder to breath then usual but not to hard
- turning Extremely pale. Im not sure if this is true but my mum said I almost looked green.
- heavy heart beat
- Chest discomfort 

Okay I hope in not forgetting anything here but the main reason I asked this dumb question is because although I do have pretty bad social anxiety and ADHD at the time of the ‘panic attack’ I didn’t feel panicked…? 

Okay well I’m done now if you could help it would mean a lot to me, thanks!"
Anxiety,"I want to kill myself, someone please give me a reason not to.","(18 M) I can't take anything anymore. I can't sleep anymore, my legs are restless and my mind is racing and I want to cry, every single night. Learning to drive is fucking me over, it scares me so much and it feels like I'll never get used to it. My social anxiety is spiking too, and its keeping me from exercising in public because eventually someone is going to try to beat me and mug me and kill me. I've been in and out of therapy for years now and every few months I'm in it I'm mostly fine and when it's time to end therapy I devolve back into being completely fucked up within another few months AND ITS THE SAME NEVERENDING FUCKING CYLCE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I don't even have any friends to talk to and I never will because I'm an empty shell that can barely function in society, if at all.

I can't take it anymore, at this rate my life is going to keep being exhausting and futile, and if I could afford it I would buy a handgun and end my suffering here and now. I'm not improving anyone's quality of life anyway, so why the fuck should I keep wasting oxygen? The only thing holding me back is that nothing short of a firearm will guarantee success, and if I survive I'll be in even worse shape than before, with practically no chance to try again. So I'm asking, someone please try to convince me that somehow anything's going to get better, because I can't imagine it ever will. It feels like I'm trapped in Purgatory, and its slowly turning into Hell."
Anxiety,Paranoid about good friend,"I have made a good friend this year. She is lots of fun, really open and friendly and invites me to do things with her a couple of times a week.
But I keep being paranoid about the whole thing collapsing and that she doesn’t really like me, I read a lot into facial expressions and tone of voice in voice notes etc. She’s super patient with me discussing these anxieties but if I keep going she’ll get sick of it for sure, I’m going to get clingy. 

Need advice on stopping feeling this way, I don’t want to destroy this relationship. I sort of just need someone to listen to her voice note and tell me she’s actually being nice and not just pretending lol

I’m a guy and only really have a few close friends and she is particularly close. Before you ask we have had that chat and it’s staying platonic. I’ve had close platonic female friends before and one in particular from university days ended up ghosting  me off and on which really hurt and last year she killed herself. This could have something to do with it I don’t know."
Anxiety,i absolutely hate the fact that i have all this anxiety in my head,"I had to make this throwaway just so i could vent. I'm so tired, so very tired of myself. I can't keep a job for a year and the ones I get accepted in are ones that make little money and make my anxiety worse (didn't finish college cause my dad decided that my tuition is better off with his mistress. and where im from you need at least a bachelors to get a good enough job). Even the idea of applying to a job scares me. I've been getting by with freelance writing work. But I want to be better. I can't even buy myself a pair of decent shoes to replace my shitty ones. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the world owes me anything or that people should pity me. I just really hate that it's so hard for me to be ""normal"". This pandemic isn't helping either, my anxiety is at its worst as it has ever been. I feel like a loser. I want to be able to function like everyone else. I want to get a job I actually enjoy and want to go to, and not cry just because I'm afraid of interacting with people. I want my family to be proud of me. I'm tired of being scared. I just want to...live."
Anxiety,My anxiety,This is how bad my anxiety is. The other day I hit a deer and had to remove a piece of plastic from underneath my car that was bent. I didn’t touch the plastic or anything with my hand. And for some reason I think I somehow may have touched the plastic and got deer blood on me. Didn’t see any btw. And now I’m worried about rabies. This is my life and it’s lame.
Anxiety,Very scared,"So fucking scared I’m going to have a seizure any moment and have something wrong with my brain, fear won’t stop 😫😫😫😫"
Anxiety,Any tips/tricks on how to deal with anxiety specifically when you wake up in the middle of the night?,"A lot on my mind lately and it's bad enough during the day, but it seems 10x worse in the middle of the night.

I go to bed early with no problems, but I'll always wake up to pee and then every little stress in my life is amplified by 100 and I often am not able to fall back asleep. 

Anyone have any suggestions for dealing with this?"
Anxiety,Am I going to die or ever get through this?,"I just want to know if I’m the only one who get really bad chest pains when I’m anxious. Like someone is squeezing all the strength in my heart so much that I’m not able to breath properly. Does anyone else feel that way? Please let me know if I’m the only one. Because sometimes these pains feel unbearable, like I’m going to die."
Anxiety,My 11yo son has terrible separation anxiety - any advice?,"He is an intelligent and sensitive kid. He has always had many worries and is prone to anxiety (as his mom - me). I am doing much better and have been on medication for the last year or so. Therapy has helped me a lot. I feel balanced and calm. No anxiety. 

2-3 months ago he started getting worried about his sister when she's not home. She is 8yo. She is very extroverted and has many friends. She is constantly on playdates.   
We live in a safe country in a very small town, everyone knows each other. School is two minutes walk away. She can bike or walk to most of her friends on her own. She is very responsible, always does as we have agreed on, and comes home at the time I have told her. Basically, no reason for him to worry. 

He also panics if he cannot call me or if I don't respond to his texts immediately. He is afraid of me going out with friends and when my husband and I were on a date he was constantly afraid and texting me the whole time. 

His fears are centred around:  
Me or/and his dad getting in a car accident or disappearing  
His sister having an accident, getting kidnapped, getting lost, disappearing

His anxiety gives him panic attacks where his heart beats like crazy, he sweats, cries and he is adamant that his worst fears is true. It helps to do breathing and grounding exercises, but he still feels like he can't control his thoughts. 

We lost his cousin when she was 6yo and he was 7yo. She had a disease that required a liver transplant and the transplant didn't succeed. She was in the hospital for 100 days, unconscious, before she died. He does not see a connection to his anxiety, but I do... 

He is currently in therapy, but he is not willing to open up. He is reluctant to talk to the therapist and I feel like the more we try and talk about it the worse the anxiety is getting. 

How can I help him? I have had anxiety since my teens and yet I don't know how to help him. I just have no clue?"
Anxiety,I hate ignorance.,"What gives people the right, especially those that know you, and you generally get on with, the right to be ignorant? It really pisses me off. I cannot stand ignorance, maybe it’s an anxiety trait, I don’t know, but it’s something that causes me deep hurt and leaves me very hurt. I don’t know why I’m like that to be honest, but what I can say is if your busy, or you don’t want to talk to me, just fucking say that? It’s pretty simple instead of leaving someone on unread/read. It just shows how much of a garbage person you really fucking are."
Anxiety,anyone knows what to do?,"So 3 years ago I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and sudden depressive episodes that I didn't know the reason for. And then two months after I started profusely sweating in my palms, feet and armpits. And these symptoms are constant, almost never ending. I'm always in stress, worrying when I'm going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home. I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating. Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I can't stop this no matter how hard I try... I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while, I'm okay. Or when I get drunk but I can't be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it. These past three years I haven't been living most of the time, I've been surviving and trying to stay sane. Though there are good days when I'm almost totally fine, there are periods when I've even thought about ending my life. I'm not sure what happened to me, if it was trauma or not... I just know nothing is helping me at the moment and I just want to ask if anyone here could give me some advise.
Btw I'm seeing a clinical psychologist and we're trying to work on it by various kinds of meditation, relaxation, stress relief but nothing works long term. I'm starting to feel like I can't relate to anyone and that my issue is so strange I'm probably the only person on earth experiencing this and it's just fogging my brain. I'm getting hopeless here, this week it's especially bad. And I'm scared that this will go on forever."
Anxiety,How to ask,"I want to ask my doctor for xans or something that helps heavy wit anxiety but i don’t wanna seem like a drug addict, nothing feels real I jus wanna be ok.please help"
Anxiety,"Like how the fuck am I supposed to go back to the old academically motivated me, who had no clue about anxiety. Yesterday I took my German language exam prep class after not taking classes for maybe 6 months and I could not handle the anxiety. I couldn't not focus on a single word she said.","I was an A* student and my anxiety fucked me up. I really enjoyed studying but I literally can't even bring myself to get to the study table and open up my books. I feel like there's nothing left in me to try and motivate myself. I still have so much of education to complete and idk how am I even going to start with it.
I'm currently taking up german language and I'm at b1 level. I started my new classes yesterday and I could not understand even a single word because my ears were ringing and my eyes were burning. I couldn't even utter a proper sentence. 
During my a2 classes, the teacher was such a bully towards the student. Since then I hated having to go to classes because I always felt dumb even though I knew most of the things. Thanks to him, my fear has taken away all my ability to study and enjoy studying. 
I can still build up the courage to study by myself but that is never enough whilst studying language because if you don't have a continuous conversation in that language, you won't pick up the fluency.
Literally don't know what to do or how to feel."
Anxiety,hi ithink im having an anxiety attack can someone helpme,
Anxiety,late night anxiety?,"I get these bouts of late night increased anxiety moments and I can't sleep. It doesn't help that my brother and his girlfriend are in the next room either arguing or talking really loud.

It has gotten to the point where sometimes I stay up until 4am. I've been taking trazedone at night too! (Don't remember the dose rn)

Anything I could do to help me sleep and ignore my thoughts??"
Anxiety,Is it possible to have anxiety with compulsions but not ocd?,"I deal with my anxieties with compulsive behavior. I repeat phrases over and over again until I feel better. I have to do this about 20 times just to get through the day.

I sometimes have to count to myself or touch or check things to make sure they’re there. 

My anxieties are related to things beyond my control, like getting in a car crash or getting in some sort of altercation. 

I also have some bfrbs. 

But, I’ve been told several times I just have anxiety and not ocd. So, I guess my question is, when does anxiety with compulsions become ocd?"
Anxiety,I need someone to calm me down,"Okay this might sound stupid but i’m freaking out right now. I just saw a tweet saying that the sun could explode tomorrow, and I read all the consequences of this and i’m scared. Someone help me please"

Anxiety,Anxiety at work and change,"Does anybody experience anxiety with small change at work? When there’s a new team member or some change I too easily get thrown and start worrying about what might happen, whether I might get sacked etc even if it’s unreasonable. It’s a nagging guy feeling that’s difficult to shake even though I know it’s just my entier y response. Going through it atm."
Anxiety,Exercise and panic attacks,"Hey,

I can't exercise. If I do some HIIT or running I am getting bunch of symptoms like dizziness I can't concentrate I have anxiety and my mind is jumping all over I'm getting thoughts that I will die etc. How to relearn my stupid brain that exercises are not dangerous? I did all the checks doctors told me I am healthy and can exercise. Yesterday I was on cycling tour with my gf we did 20 miles and near our home I got micro panic attack and thoughts that my heart will stop. It's so annoyed. I see people in the part running I want to do the same. I did jogging 3 years ago 3 times per week 3.5 miles but once got panic attack and then stopped."
Anxiety,lying because I have bad anxiety today,So I woke up and immediately had a full blown panic attack idk why. And than have been having bad anxiety for the last 2 hours I am supposed to go to work in 2 hours but I really don't think I can bring myself to walk out the door..am i wrong for calling out sick? I genuinely don't feel good because anxiety is making me nauseous and I'm a nanny to a stay at home working family. I just don't think I want to move from bed I want to take a Hydroxyzine and relax but when I take those I get really sleepy. I can't watch kids like that..
Anxiety,I think I need to break up with my girlfriend and I can’t stop thinking about how much it will hurt her,"Basically the title. I’ve never broken up with an SO before but I have been broken up with and it absolutely devastated me. The idea of potentially sending someone who I truly do care about so much into a state of mind like that is almost too much for me to handle, but I have realized that continuing in this relationship causes me anxiety on a daily basis due to the fact that she has a habit of obsessing over negative things/occurrences in her life. 

As someone who’s dealt with anxiety for years now I obviously sympathize with her on a deep level, however prior to our relationship beginning about 6 months ago, I felt I had been steadily improving my mental health and was finally in a good enough place to be in a relationship with someone again. Now, though, because of the fact that I spend so much time with someone not in such a healthy state of mind, I feel myself reverting back into my old mental state. 

There are other factors at play here, too, influencing my reasons to believe that the break up is necessary. I just can’t handle the idea of hurting this person who I care about and want to help so badly. I’m so lost right now and I feel as if whatever choice I make I will regret. I’m going to see her around 5pm EST (11 hours from the time of this post), and while I sit here and know that I have to be honest with her that I simply don’t see it working out in the long run, I can’t say for sure that I’ll be able to pull the trigger when it gets down to it. Seeing her react the way I envision it going down is just not something I think I can ever be prepared for."

I know this isn't healthy or constructive and I have been trying my best to avoid this. I also have depression and wonder how much this plays a roll as well.

Anxiety,"How did you turn your life around, from having daily anxiety to becoming a high achieving individual free of anxiety?","If you are someone who had regularly daily anxiety for half a decade, whole decade or even longer and have been able to live a normal life without anxiety since, how did you do it?

What made the difference for you?"
Anxiety,Am I doing exposure wrong? Challenging myself for the sake of it,"I've been getting CBT and part of it is doing behavioural experiments where I test a negative thought about something, eg. I worry that I will be sick when I drive to the shops, so the test is to go out and drive to the shops. But im really struggling to know when to do these exposures.

Does it really help if I don't actually want or need to go? I think I struggle with secondary depression from my anxiety, so my actual desire to do things just isn't there. I don't *want* or *need* to go to the shops, so that just makes me less likely to do the exposure because there's no incentive. Its so hard to do an exposure when it feels like you're just doing something for the sake of it, if that makes any sense.  The only time I've got over stuff like this in the past is when I've had a spark of actual desire to do stuff, and that motivates me to get better and expose myself to scary situations. But at the moment it's like...trying to get better but with no momentum. Does anyone else get this or have any tips? Should I just do the exposures anyway?"
Anxiety,Experiencing anxiety in the stomach a whole day,"Sometimes I have a whole day of anxiety. This is where I get what I guess could be called butterflies on my stomach the whole day. In addition my stomach/chest feels tight and I experince rapid heart rate as well as shortness of breath on and off. Yet, the butterflies and tight stomach/chest stays. Sometimes, it will carry over the next day. This can occur when I wake up on the morning but can often begin just before I sleep. I hope to wake up feeling normal but that's often not the case. Sometimes it'll be gone by the following day whether jrs when I awake or later on.

When this happens it's very hard to handle. Breathing exercises, meditation or general distractions may bring temporary ease at the best. It seems the best I can do at the moment is sit and wait for it to end. It can get so bsd where I feel sick. 

I assume that it can be regarded as an attack once I get the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate: I don't tend to get any other symptoms when this happens (feeling of general anxiety all day),nor usually in a regular attack. Nonetheless, the two symptoms can get really bad and only seems to get worse.

I don't even recall having heavy stress. I recall having slight stress around work and sometimes around my future, for I've been at some time at a crossroad, stuck between two somwhat life-changing decisions. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be very much appreciated."
Anxiety,Can someone help?,"So to start of I have always been a anxious person, I have bad health anxiety. But I have never had a panic attack ever. So for a week I have had a lot of energy drinks, and fast food roughly 7 bang energy drinks throughout the week. So about 5 days ago I was at a local store with my friend when all of a sudden at checkout I feel so weird. I had derealization I figured. I rush a back home, listen to some music when I get such a weird feeling, the feeling that I was going to die. I walk around then I purposely fell on the couch when I had my first panic attack. I felt so exhausted and tired after that. For the past 5 days I have experienced shaking, fatigue, some derealization, intense heart rate when I even walk. The feeling I’m about to faint or get another panic attack if I walk, and some pain in my head. I am so unbelievably scared. I don’t know what to think. I just want to feel normal again. My mom says snap out of it, and my dad isn’t taking the matter too serious. Can someone tell me what is maybe going on? Do I have some type of brain tumor, or Parkinson’s disease? I have been drinking a lot of water the matter doesn’t help."
Anxiety,This is dumb,"My hair is too long and I want a haircut the problem is that I am freaking out about going to the fucking barber. It's so ridiculous it's just a fucking barber I know nothing bad is going to happen but I am still freaking out. First off I need to call them and make an appointment that in itself is already fucking terrible cause ya know calling somewhere is terrible enough and then I have never called a barber before. The last couple years my sister has been cutting my hair cause pandemic shit and all and before that my mom made the appointments so I have never called one before and I am stressing cause I don't know what the fuck to say. 

And then idk how to tell the barber what kinda haircut I want. I used to have long hair and that was easy just told them how much shorter to make it but now I need to know like what kinda fade I want and shit and how many millimetres my hair is supposed to be long on the sides and everything and I don't know any of that cause I just told my sister to do what she wants and she did and that was alright. 

And just it's all so dumb cause I just puked cause all this shit is stressing me so much and it's just a HAIRCUT. I hate myself so much. Why am I like this? I hate having anxiety other people just go and get a haircut and I have been wanting my hair cut for a fucking month now and it's bothering me so much and I just can't do it and I told myself I am gonna call today and I just can't manage it ffs. All I managed is make myself absolutely miserable over a fucking haircut, maybe I should just give myself a buzzcut and call it a day and never bother with a fucking barber again"

Anxiety,Buzzing/vibrating in leg for days,"Ive been buzzing/vibrating in my leg for days now, every second. Its not like twitching, feels like something under like a phone calling. Really annoying and it makes my anxiety just worse.

Like I don’t want to badmouth the person or speak ill will about them and id hope out of respect they wouldn’t do the same to me, but it makes me feel awkward when someone else mentions their name in my presence and it reminds me of our falling out.  Anyone been in those situations?"
Anxiety,Is there a point when Xanax stops working?,"I was diagnosed and medicated for a bit and then I felt like the the doctor wasn't a good fit for me so I stopped going for appointments or getting medicated. Its been months and things started getting bad again. I still have leftover medication,  Xanax, for emergencies. 

I haven't took one in quite a long time but I needed it today. It helped me sleep for a bit but the symptoms are starting again but it has only been 5 hours since I last took it. Usually it lasts me at least an entire night, gives me enough time to get in some physical exercise and breathing exercises to self regulate a little. 

I'm scared that the medicine might not be effective for me anymore. Does Xanax stop working after some point?

Ps, I don't drink, smoke, do other illegal drugs or consume any other medication except for my depression and anxiety."
Anxiety,Do I have anxiety?,"Before I start this, I know the best way to know is asking a doctor or a therapist but for personal reasons I can't really do that right now. 

With that being said, all my life I've been scared of doing new things, the first time i bought something at the store i could barely talk, the first time i went to highschool, the firt time i drove, the first time i moved out. Just doing these things would make me freeze almost as a kid, as i grow older its a lot easier to handle obviously. I've never thought about anxiety before at all because no one in my family really has it, or at least not to my knowledge.

It's only in recent years that I began to realise i might have anxiety, maybe not super high beause ive never had a panick attack (Well i have had 1 when i was really high but, I was really high soo, anyways. Now that I'm making friends and dating and talking more to people in general i'm starting to see why i've been this way all my life 

When I get a phone call, no matter who it is, the first few seconds when i know someone is calling, my heart skips a beat, I start sweating and then i get idk scared? It's hard to explain but hearing how others describe anxiety I think thats what it is 
I just get anxious 

Anyways, I posted this because I wanted to knoe if I was the only one like this? And if you guys think I might be anxious or something else or even just normal
I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course not, it's just that untill I see a professional I'd like to get an idea of what i might have before I see one 

You can also DM me if you want to talk about anything, Idk why you would but you can:)"

Anxiety,Is this paranoia or anxiety?,"

Hi everyone,

I have a constant fear (which sometimes peaks and it becomes unbearable) that people my find out secrets about me and ruin my life by telling them.

It never actually happened to me but I always think that WHAT IF and start feeling extremey anxious.

In my childhood my mom would very often search my room or my laptop to find things about me and attack me with them few days later and I know now that that is the root of it.

But really what I need to know is, do people actually do this? Like use something you told only to them to ruin relationships or make people lose their jobs? 

I'm mainly afraid of men doing this in moments of angerness cause I lived surrounded by them all my life and they seem so unpresictable...

Also, whenever I find courage to confess myself to someone that I (at the moment) trust I get immediate thoughts that maybe the information might leak through them to others that we'll surely cause me harm with it.

I try to help myself with breathing techniques and meditation but it doesn't really work on the long run as long as the thought is still there.

It's so draining and hard cause in my head every situation seems real and valid and feels like I don't even get intimacy in my own head!"
Anxiety,moving forward with anxiety,"So i graduated a few months back, been job hunting for all that time. Now i finally got a job offer i am so anxious instead of happy.

Anxiety,do I not like him or is it just my anxiety?,"I (18F) have been in a relationship for a short time, about a month, with a guy (18M) from my class. I see him everyday due to school but I've hung out with him only twice, and both times I felt very very anxious. When I think about him or the fact that I have to see him I start feeling uneasy, anxious, my heart rate increases and I begin to panic. It is my first relationship ever (and also his first relationship) and it had a rough start, due to some people interfering causing a misunderstanding. I suffer from anxiety, and I've been seeing a therapist for almost a year
I think we moved too fast: although we knew each other already, we started talking and creating a bond only recently and I feel like we were both 'pushed' into this relationship. 
Sometimes I think I agreed to this relationship only because he's the first guy who has ever shown interest in me, and he's the only male that I know and that I consider 'eligible'. When I think about the future I don't really see each other together. Sometimes I even think that I don't really like him and that I'm selling myself short by being with him, that I could have someone better (but it's probably my narcissistic part talking). 
What should I do? Should I end things with him? Should I see where it goes? Should I explain how I feel to him?

I constantly have to do something either draw,craft or be on and off my phone while “watching” a movie. I have to tho back minutes into the movie cause I am constantly zooming out.

Anxiety,Sertraline,"Hiya everyone - on day 2 of 25mg sertraline. I was put on it for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

* I do not want to go off these meds so please do not suggest that. Should I notice severe symptoms, yes, I will reach out to my doctor. This post is simply looking for tips people used to make the beginning stages aittle smoother *

1. I take mine at 7pm as my pharmacist recommended at night due to drowsiness. Night one I was drowsy with a little bit of anxiousness but overall was good. 2nd night, slightly drowsy but much more anxious and had a bit of a hard time getting to sleep. Any tips for this? 

2. Mornings seems a bit rough - feel quite jittery in the morning when I wake up and on edge. 

3.  Loss of appetite / very minimal nausea- I do notice that once I sit down and eat something though I feel a bit better, wondering if I should just force myself to eat something? Even if I'm not feeling hungry. 

So far, these are the only hiccups I'm having, please send any tips my way, greatly appreciate it!"
Anxiety,Anxiety and illness is ruining my life.,"Apologies for what might be a long read but I really need to vent somewhere and I’m hoping some of the things I write here will resonate with someone else. I am a 29 year old female and My anxiety began around 7 year ago when my second born child was around 1 years old. The first time I noticed it was a mild fluttering in my chest/throat that made me want to cough, about 3 weeks later I got first full blown panic attack, a few days later my second and then third, I was convinced I was dying these what I now know to be anxiety attacks manifested into feelings of a crushing headache, heart pounding, feeling like I was going to pass out and feeling like my vision was going to go. On one such episode I was rushed to hospital where they thought I had a bleed on the brain due to the severity of these attacks. I had to stay for 4 days and battery of tests later including scans and I was diagnosed with migraines and then later anxiety. 
It took me months to get on top of my symptoms but after a while they went away and life returned to normal, aside from the odd panic attack or weird fluttering in my throat life was good again. 
Fast forward to the past 18 months when symptoms of anxiety became severe again, panic attacks that made me so hot I wanted to throw off my clothes, constantly feeling unwell or like I was coming down with the flu. Nocturnal panic attacks that wake me covered in sweat and convinced I was having a heart attack. Heart palpitations multiple times a day. Neck pain and headaches all par for the course. Stomach symptoms, feeling dazed or like I’m going to pass out for no reason and tingling hands. Doctors ran a battery of yet again including ultrasounds, multiple rounds of blood work a colonoscopy for the stomach symptoms all absolutely fine I’m the picture of health apparently so why don’t I feel like it. Why am I constantly tired, fatigued feeling dazed and unwell at least 4 days out of 7? 
My doc tried me on some type of anxiety depression medication which I was allergic to and gave me serotonin syndrome that landed me in hospital. Probably one of the worse experiences of my life. 
At this point I’m feeling so hopeless and I’m convinced I’m either going crazy or that there is something seriously wrong with me. Can anxiety really be the cause of all those physically symptoms that feel so real? 

I have stopped socialising as much as I used to because the thought of this happening in public is so embarrassing not to mention that alcohol makes my anxiety so much worse. 

I am lucky that I am self employed so working a few days a week can afford me the income that I’d get working full time on the days I feel well. I’m also extremely privileged to have a supportive partner, children and family. 

I’m just so frustrated that the best years of my life are consumed by feeling so shit and weird. 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this thank you for reading x"
Anxiety,Quitting Lexapro,"Hi. I stopped taking Lexapro in January after being on it for about 10 years. Since then, I’ve been dealing with some weird problems that I think is related to me quitting.

My main problems have been tense neck, numbness/tension in my face and jaw, sometimes my face will feel hot and get red when drinking alcohol now, numbness in my left hand pinky and ring finger, cold feet, and vision problems and overall increased anxiety. I went to the eye doctor for floaters and she said that I do have them and that it’s normal.

I think my anxiety at this point is manifesting itself as health anxiety. I started off thinking I was having a heart attack. Then it was lymphoma or some type of cancer. Now it’s diabetes. I just had blood work done in January right before I quit and everything was apparently fine except for high cholesterol. 

Can anyone else like me that has quit Lexapro after taking it for a long time relate?  I’m wondering is my brain chemistry is still adjusting even after quitting over three months ago.  And by the way, I did taper for months ahead of quitting."
Anxiety,Heart palpitations when doing exams,"Hi everyone! So I started getting heart palpitations about a year or two ago and they really freak me out

However, I’ve concluded that they must be caused by anxiety because it happened to me today when I was doing a school exam! I know I’m not dying and it just makes me feel uncomfortable more then anything else but does anyone know how to stop them?

I’m a high achieving student and never got heart palpitations before when I’ve done other exams years ago, I think the anxiety’s only come on now

In addition to this I also get really hot a lot of the time

I know I’m not having a heart attack or anything because my dad has them too, so I think it’s genetic

One other thing to add is, I don’t actually feel anxious at all in my life, even going into the exam I feel calm and collective, it’s only once I start the exam my heart goes - but I don’t have the anxious feeling just the heart palpitations!

Any help on controlling my exam anxiety would be very much appreciated thank you!"
Anxiety,My anxiety is ruining my relationships,I feel like a misery to all my friends because of irritability and anxious antics. Sometimes the pain of my anxiety is all can talk about and it sucks that I don’t really have anyone who knows what it’s like. I just feel like a burden to my friends and family
Anxiety,Studying abroad and the sheer nervousness of the situation,"So if all goes according to plan, I'll be in a language school in another country. 

Admittedly, there's a part of me terrified. ""What if it's a bust"" ""what if the experience is terrible""

What doesn't help is that my family thinks everything is a scam. Some have never left our hometown because they think hotels, airplanes, etc are scams. 

Not sure how to process my feelings"
Anxiety,Do you use benzos?,"I use clonazepam 2mg daily for over a decade. I'm now using 3mg, and it's making me sleepy."
Anxiety,Being called “sweetie” or “hon” at work,"This happens a lot because I’m a receptionist and I try to keep my voice friendly. I don’t mind if it comes from coworkers (though it never does, they always call me by name). But when it comes from strangers it drives me up the wall. I’ll be anxiously seething for hours afterward. How do I defuse it, or do I just ignore it?"
Anxiety,I (F22) don’t feel safe in my car anymore. How do I either calm myself or convince my parents to buy me a new one?,"I am very fortunate and come from a financially stable family but we are by no means rich. I live at home with my amazing mom and dad who are very supportive of me. Two of our cars we purchased used with at least 70,000 miles on them and our other car we bought 15 years ago and has more than 150,000 miles on it. I drive a little Volkswagen Bug (discontinued😫). It’s a very cute car, it’s super easy to drive, and I get a lot of compliments on it so I love that. I am SO lucky that my parents provided this vehicle for me years ago when I started to drive. However, I recently started commuting on the freeway and if any of you live in Southern California you know that they are very busy and often dangerous. I am a good driver, but I have terrible anxiety and though I am getting it treated I just don’t want to drive this little car anymore because it feels like a tin can. Please don’t share any data regarding the safety of this car if you know anything about it because that will only trigger me. I would just like to focus on perhaps purchasing a new car for me that is bigger. My best friend’s mom is thinking of selling her Ford car which is really sleek, easy to drive, and higher off the ground and bulky which means for me that I would feel safe in it, and given that I’m going to be spending a lot more time on the freeway in the morning and afternoon (1 hr+) I would feel much more comfortable in a larger car. How do you think I should go about presenting this idea to my mom and dad?🫢

I want to emphasize that the kind of car does not matter to me, I’m not looking for something fancy at all. I just want something where I’m higher off the ground and feel safer if, God forbid, something were to hit my car.

Anxiety,Venting,"So I have FMLA with my job for days when I am feeling very anxious. I usually use them intermittently. After my last session with my therapist she recommended a 2 week leave.

I guess because I am so used to it, but I find myself feeling like I should work not for me but because I feel unproductive if I don’t.. 😖"

Anxiety,Help.,"I have had anxiety all my life so this whole experience is just a nightmare i relive constantly. I started experiencing nausea (as i have before but this time felt different) bc i was scared it was my gallbladder or pancreas. I went to urgent care and was there for 8 hours. To tell me i was anemic. 
Then i go to see my pcm the next day and shes like i dont think you have anemia. And she poked and prodded at my stomach and she was like i think you have gastritis, acid reflux (which ive had for a while as im 8 months postpartum and it never went away) and constipation. Anywho.

Anxiety,I hate oral presentations,"I'm in my first year of university in France, and in my English class I have to choose a video and explain it in 3 minutes. The first time I had to do this, she made half of the class talk at the same time and she came to listen to us, but for the second time I couldn't come to class so now I'll have to do it in front of everyone...

I can't even choose a video, for the first one I came across a video about the Mongol Derby, the longest horse race in the world, and it's a subject that was somewhat interesting, but now I can only find things about politics or war, and if it's something interesting it's too short, and the video has to come from BBC news or the likes, so I can't take a random video from youtube

I can't choose a subject, and I'll have to speak in front of so many people because I missed a class, I don't know what to do, even if I know I have no choice but to do it

I feel like I'll just mess it up..."
Anxiety,People aren’t kidding when they say it feels like a hole in your chest,"A very tight, dense black hole. Like it’s lodged in my sternum. Like a physical problem, like someone took a pen and lodged it in there and said “suffer”. It makes breathing hurt.

Anxiety,Anxiety when things are going well,When I started to implement healthy habits and my mood starts to lift I get a lot of anxiety and stress about things possibly getting worse again. The ironic thing is that because I get anxious about that outcome it usually happens because of the stress and anxiety.
Anxiety,Any advice for anxiety as it pertains to flight anxiety?,"Recently I traveled from Texas to California and took a plane since driving wouldn't be the most efficient option. My experience on the plane itself was terrifying, I was in the middle seat and I found myself not being able to look out the window and being scared to even turn my head. I was shaking a little bit, not too much where it was really noticeable to the people next to me but enough for me to feel really uneasy. The flight itself was a couple of hours and gotten a little bit better as time went on but it still wasn't anxiety free, I would say it was 6 out of 10 in intensity. Do you have any tips to help get rid of the fear/anxiety of flying?"
Anxiety,"Im not happy with the career i ""chose""","Until recently i realized that i usually don't tell others what i want just to not inconvenience them and that has really affected me in a lot of ways, years ago i wanted to study psychology but my parents persuaded me to choose something that pays better and i went to study engineering, after two semesters i got out because i couldn't with math and when choosing another 
 me into something else and this time it was dentistry.
Im now on the 8th semester (out of 10) but now i lost all motivation to study and most likely will fail a lot of subjects. I will get my degree because im too close to the end but i just wish i had the courage to speak up, if i did I would be happier and possibly already graduated.
By the way,my parents had the best intentions, they grew up really poor and want me to make a lot of money so i don't go through that, they are not controlling,they just worry a lot"
Anxiety,How to deal with anxiety when you didn’t have it before,"I’m 28 and recently started becoming much more anxious. I’d like to try to avoid it becoming a permanent part of my life. Any tips to help get back to normal?

Info: I’ve always been slightly anxious, but in the past couple weeks it has gotten much worse. Hearing abrupt noises has made me feel very uncomfortable, and if I do something slightly off, it makes me shut down. I’ve been trying to breathe and think everything is okay, but the physical anxiety lasts longer than it ever has before. It’s not constant, but it can happen suddenly for almost no reason."
Anxiety,Do my meds help or may they be the cause of me getting worse down the line?,"I take gabapentin 600mg, quetiapine 25mg, verapamil 40mg and amitriptyline 100mg daily. And they help, but sometimes I worry that they won’t help anymore and I’ll be worse off without them"
Anxiety,Anxiety Sleep drugs which don't give dementia?,"The strong links to dementia from Anticholinergic drugs but also benzos and z drugs makes me paranoid about even taking my 6 prescribed 5mg diazepam a month.

Is there any effective drugs for anxiety, panic and or sleep that doesn't have such Anticholinergic properties and wont cause me to have dementia by the time I'm 50?

Why can't nothing in life be so simple, diazepam makes shit easy to handle yet will give you dementia, great.

And if anyone says things like diet, exercise and therapy then they have no idea about mental health, these are some of the first things most people try and address."
Anxiety,Tips to bring down your heart rate,"While my mind isn’t anxious my body is. For the last 13 hours my resting heart rate is 90+ bpm. I woke up many times over night from crazy dreams and had a heart rate of 130 after one of them. My mind isn’t racing the way it does when I’m anxious, but my body is telling me that I am. 
I’ve tried
- deep/mindful breathing 
- distractions 
- and meditation 

Right now smoking weed isn’t an option, but I’m open to anything that can help me lower this. Thank you!"

Anxiety,I am not fond of this current version of me,"I am a 6'1 tall, decent looking guy. I've always been known for being the social guy. I used to play soccer for my university team and think I was moderately popular in my batch. 
But post lockdown, I've transformed into a completely different person. I feel so lonely, I don't even know where to start. I'm close to no one around me, if I disappear tomorrow, maybe no one will care. Even when I hangout with my friends, I am just physically present but not mentally. It's like, I've nothing to add to the conversation. 
I have developed a lot of insecurities. I haven't asked out anyone for a date in over a year and whenever I see a happy couple, the voices inside me kick in, telling me how lonely I am.
I just feel that people don't like me and I don't even know why. I just feel that I've given up on my social life even though I don't want to."

An anxiety attack is a sudden and intense episode of fear that triggers a set of physical reactions that can simulate a heart attack or generate a feeling of imminent death. Although they can be very frightening, they occur in the absence of real danger and without apparent cause. In most cases, there are only one or two episodes in a lifetime, namely in periods of greater stress. If they are repeated, causing a constant fear of a new attack, we are facing a pathological panic. Anxiety attacks are common, affecting more than a third of adults annually. However, women experience these episodes two to three times more often than men. Pathological panic is rarer and is diagnosed in less than 1% of the population, usually in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although they affect quality of life significantly, they can be treated effectively.

Stress is one of the main leading causes of health problems and depression affecting millions of people across the world globally. Meditation is a healthy way to rest your mind and body through breathing, controlling your frenetic routine and adopting calming habits. It teaches us to live in the present moment and appreciate everything we have now, leaving the past behind and the future for later. These video can help and facilitate meditation, relaxation through a series of images and sounds to help focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress."
Anxiety,Anyone else think of minor stuff that happened a long time ago and it bothers you all day,"Today I was cooking and I randomly thought of this time when I was a kid and by my grandparents with my cousins.  Their neighbors were redoing their fence so they said that we could play on their swing set.  

This kid from up the block came and asked me if he could play.  I pointed to the neighbor and said ""you have to ask"" so he went by the neighbor and apparently  said that I said he couldn't  play  with us, so the neighbor called me over and gave me a lecture about how I shouldn't tell people they can't play because it's his swing set.  

I never even told the other kid no, I said to ask. But I was always taught not to argue with adults so I got a lecture for something I didn't even do.  


For some reason I remembered this this morning and it's been bugging me since.  Even though it was probably 20 years ago."
Anxiety,A NATURAL supplement that has actually been working for my anxiety!,"Hi guysss, I’ve snuggled with anxiety for numerous years now and have tried sooooooooo many natural supplements you could name, but none of them ever worked for me. I have never taken any SRI’s, but was super close to wanting to try them once since my anxiety got so bad that it made me depressed as well. 

Anyways, I’m REALLY hoping this supplement works for you as well for your anxiety, I call them my magic pills and am sooo grateful!!! I still feel anxious at times, but the intensity is sooo minimal due to these pills, I can live a normal life— they are amazing! It’s called Sleep support plus by mind body green. I just wanted to spread the word and hope it helps others as well!!! 

I will say that this natural supplement is intended for sleep obviously— but for ME, it doesn’t help me with sleep AT ALLL even though that was the original season as to why I started taking them cuz I have a bad habit of sleeping late 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ But I was so impressed to see that it affected me positively in a different area with reducing my stress/anxiety levels instead!! One of the BIGGEST symptoms I have with anxiety is brain fog. I freaking used to feel it ALL the time — even if I slept 8 hours every night. I seriously no longer feel brain fog when I wake up &amp; I feel soooo refreshed!!! Please try these and let me know if they work for you!! I really really hope they do! 🙏🏻🙏🏻"

Anxiety,Anxiety before stuff (M26),"Hello all!

Anxiety,Anyone with mainly psychological social anxiety success with Propranolol?,"My anxiety is more psychological (thinking and worrying about what others might think about me, what I‘m going to say or said, if I look dumb, if people criticize me atm and so on, you all know it). It‘s mainly connected with thought patterns, negative thoughts and psychological anxiety. 

I also have physiological symptoms, but not very strong as others. For example I get very stiff and rigid, like I dont want to do a wrong move, which leads to tensions and convulsions sometimes. Sure faster heart beat and sometimes red face too. Also my mouth and face get tensed.

In my opinion not so pronounced or important but maybe these physiological symptoms I have are affecting me subconsciously and therefore they may be more important and crucial than I think.

What have been your experiences? Mostly it‘s said Propanolol is only for people with physiological anxiety. That‘s why my doc didn‘t even try it on me in the first place, even if I suggested it."

Anxiety,I wrote something 4 months ago and i am pretty sure it will be helpful to you!,"The Sour Island

I will meet you there; on the sour island.
Where the idea of what a happy life is; undefined.
Where the journey is more interesting then; the desired outcome.
Where for once, you let your jokes be truly your; and the songs that you sing; the dance moves that you make.
BUT only if the perfectionist in you; give a poem without literary devices a go.

Where the things you like are not associated with a certain gender or a age; where the world is all gray, beautiful &amp; equal. Abstract.
Where you GET to be a human being; instead of a coded robot.
Where you realize; life is not all about YOLO &amp; FOMO.
Where for once you let your dreams be truly yours; and realize every-other thing is a cool culture fantasy of others.
Where you would stop *quantifying &amp; qualifying life*, if only for once.

Where you stop seeking escapism everytime your glasses are on.
But only if you could rise above the reality; &amp; wake up spiritually.
Where you get to attach and then detach with certain loops of life; and be content with it; where you stop seeking a higher kick everytime.
For once you would realize what life is; rather than what it could have been.
Where you care more about how you percieve yourself; v/a how you are being perceived.

Where the power is in you;
No not in your body;
Not in your soul;
Not in your actions;
Not in your words.

Yes the poem is a bit scary;
The poem is abstract;
Undefined;
Theoretical.
But also heart-warming.
As the poem is about the perception of life and that thing ... ?
Will depend on how you percieve the lines.

 And I?  For once; let this poem be mine. And only mine."
Anxiety,Help me stop freaking out about tinnitus,[removed]
Anxiety,I get anxious being away from my partner,"I (26F) have anxiety every time my partner (25F) and I are separated.

It all started when my partner left for military basic training, for the first time ever I had an anxiety attack and went into a deep depression those entire 2 months. I completely lost myself, we were in a long distance relationship at the time but the complete separation scared me. I worried about her every day, I did everything under the sun to stay distracted but ended up reaching a point of deep depression. We have lived together for many years now but every time we separate we both deal with anxiety, when we say goodbye I always have a lump in my throat, I smile and try to hide it but once I get privacy I always cry. I keep myself extremely busy to try to pass time, I keep reciting the day she will be back in my head, I try to calm myself down but nothing works. I think this may stem from my parents separating and how I felt without my dad. She will be gone today and tmrw and won’t be very far at all, I think she’s completely fine but I’m struggling already. I have therapy Monday because overall I deal with anxiety. We spend a lot of time together because I work from home, she has few friends and I really don’t have any so I think that impacts my emotions as well. It is even to a point even when I am with family I still feel this emptiness and anxiety."
Anxiety,Diazepam Vs Temazepam,"My doctor prescribed me 8 x 10mg pills of Valium for panic attacks which is clearly not enough this is the letter I’m writing to my psychiatrist, what are your thoughts? Is there anything you would change?

And I think temazepam would be the right drug for me because of insomnia and anxiety and diazepam is ineffective for me 

-

Personally I think switching to temazepam would help more as Valium is causing side effects (headaches and nausea) and not helping at all

The dose (10mg) is not enough and I can’t feel it with my tolerance so I think the maximum dosage of temazepam 40-60mg would help my anxiety because I have a large tolerance to benzodiazepines (was taking 10-20mg of clonazepam for a while) and diazepam is causing me side effects and not effective in dealing with my anxiety. I think switching to temazepam 2-3 times a week would really help because I’ve had a very stressful time recently and that way I wouldn’t gain dependence

I haven’t take quetapitine yet due to worries with my recently diagnosed brugada syndrome in which certain antipsychotics are not good to take"
Anxiety,Does anyone else have a disabled family member?,"My mum is physically disabled, in pain daily, and I think that's been the main cause of my anxiety.

You always have to be on your toes around her because she's so sensitive to pain."
Anxiety,I don’t feel too good,"Lately, I feel awful. My hair is a perpetual mess that ignores products and has only one purpose in like that is to defy gravity. 

My face is full of acne marques, I have very pronounced dark circles. I look super exhausted.

I’ve gained weight and my stomach looks awful since my surgery. I have no idea wth they did to my belly button but it looks awful.

I’m so very anxious and stressed. Some other moments very depressed.

My whole body hurts, my stomachs hurts, my head hurts, my joints hurts. I feel super tired and weak. 

I can’t seem to fall asleep without mixing medication. 

I have so much on my plate right now… and nothing that I can’t do about it… I’ve did my part and now I can only wait for results. 

I feel like my body is completely out of whack. 

I’m scared to go back to work.

I wish something would progress and allow me to take better care of myself. I can’t go on like this. I don’t want to feel miserable like this 😢"
Anxiety,I am losing hope. (Vertigo),"Certain I've had it for about 2 years now, and I'm currently consulting Neurologist every month for the past year. Been giving me anti-anxiety meds, betahistine, antidepressants which help with the panic attacks, but the dizziness has been coming and going. I've consulted an ENT, got my blood chem, ECG, lung X-ray, ENT CT scan (I'm taking nasal sprays for rhinitis).

I've also tried going to a chiropractor which didn't really make a difference despite having cool crackly sounds. I don't even remember how many doctors I've been to, but I'm shooting my shot whether someone has experienced the same thing. It's been bothering my social life and career. I've lost some friends because of not being able to show up due to my constant dizziness. Is it stress from work? I'm a video editor and I don't really work like typical editors do. I work 9 hrs a day (or less) and that's about it.

Despite that I am very active. I skateboard everyday for 2 hrs. 

IDK why I'm posting here either, just shooting my shot if ever someone has the same story as I have.

Thank you"
Anxiety,First day of holiday and having a panic attack,"I just finished 18 hours of flying to Europe and vomited twice on the flight over, I’m not sure if this is because of anxiety or air sickness, but I have now been off the plane for 3 hours and I still feel nausea which is making me panic. I am travelling alone and I am regretting my decision because I feel like I’m going to die and I don’t know what to do. Can anyone give me any tips on how to overcome this ?"
Anxiety,My birthday yesterday 3/28,"Sorry this is just going to be a ramble and bunch of thoughts.

I couldn’t sleep so I was watching Netflix show, then I just started thinking about everyone who reached out and said happy birthday and those who didn’t. I thought about friends not in touch anymore. How we could have stayed in touch. Do i even have friends? Relationships broken. Then I just started crying, like did I enjoy my b-day? questioning my existence. feel like i havent cried in a while and it all came out. 

Also went to a funeral for the first time last week it just gave me such a weird feeling. Meeting someone for the first time in a decade and it’s at a funeral. Never seen him like that, in shambles cuz of his wife’s death. I kept thinking about her in the casket. how would i be seen when i die and wtf am i doing w my life rn. Will I find someone to build a family with. I want kids I want someone i want to spend my life with. i feel so lonely.

My grandma also fell and broke her hip so she had surgery two days ago. Thought about how i would feel if the surgery didnt go well. If it would even go well at all. The surgery did go well. But like now im thinking if she would recover quickly. Idek i hope she does and fully. 

I am such a fucking mess. Just needed to unload… and i didnt know where/who to go to"
Anxiety,"I don’t know whats going on with me, my life and my mind…","

Well, i am not expect that it’s gonna help me mentally, but this post probably could help me in emotional way, sometimes it’s feels so good to be heard out and have a side of support, and reddit could be a proper place where you can find it that, i think many can agree. The thing, why i am writting this, is because i just simply don’t know what’s going in my life and with my well-being. To me it seems that i have plenty symptoms of various disorders, recently i started to feel spaced out or zone out, i think people here know those terms very well, it’s something like that, when you’re watching at something, but actually u don’t, no object, just your mind take you up somewhere in the clouds, and just lose a touch with reality. This is not the end of the line guys, my self-estem below regular, if someone would say me something sensetive and touchy, i would not mind that, at all, seems i lost my natural feeling of angriness, but anyway i would react, but not because of the feeling, but because i know how i should to “act” when someone disrespect you, but no feelings only fake out, weird, it haven’t happened before, unless i do not remember of my poor memory, my memory also started going downhill ant it is give me a big anxiety. And anxiety always been a big part in my life, the last time when i felt calm and relaxed at the chilhood, from 14 i started suffering suicidal depression, and after one year it slipt away, and actually it doesn’t it’s just owergrown in anxiety disorder ant later on panic attacks i use to have them everyday day also for one year, so right i guess i a new stage, my mind just exausted and tired of everything what was happened from 14 until now i am 20 years old i suffer a long-term misery, at this point, my mind can't create correct sentences, the only thing i can really say when anyone asks me whats wrong is 'i don't know' i really don't know. in that state, i can't think of anything but i don't know. sentences, thinking, logic, it all just hurts my mind more. No energy, no thoughts or my thougts flowing very fastly that i can’t even catch them, none of them they aren’t processable. I think i still suffer depression and i also guess that i started to experience spiritual awakening, i started to see and sense the other people energy, still i can’t explain, but those people who are sleep and just care about the earthly material and all they care is money, they talk nonsense and they just robbering my vitality, i have no energy mentally and physically to perform any sort of task. When i am writting this my minds feels literally overlouded with something and i just don’t know how to put everything correctly in the words, because my problem seems much higher and bigger. At least im out of my comfort zone, i was overstayed in my house for 5 months, now i left not just my house but also the country, it is also possibly has some effect to me, i need time to adjust, but those 5 months didn’t added me any value, all that time i were pleasing myself with porn. How i feel now? Want to be alone, or just want to be understanded at least maybe because of that i want to feel alone, because i don’t know if somwehere is a right person. And in the all i wanted to say that this world sometimes feels unreal, i am looking at this world and honestly i just don’t believe it’s happening.  in general i don’t know who causing me this condition and i think thats all, i will apreciate any back comment."
Anxiety,pvc feeling as my heart been stopping been waking me up all night and it's 2:30am,Felt really tired no pvc issue that I noticed. Went to bed feeling tired as can be. Waking up randomly with a feeling as if my heart stopped and I couldn't take it anymore and it's 2:30am. Still waiting on my results from the holt monitor.
Anxiety,What does your therapy look like?,"I've been going to therapy for almost a year now and have seen two different people, but both experiences have been similar. I've gotten a lot of tips and tricks, really built up a toolkit, but it feels wrong in a way? Like the way I'm doing this is helping, but also not. It's kind of like ""Great, I can work on my anxiety, but we don't even know why I have anxiety.""

I know therapy isn't like what we see in movies. I also know you get out what you put in. I've expressed that there are things in my past I struggle with and need some help getting closure on, but it seems like all I'm getting out of it is ""We will try to fix this current problem and send you on your way."" I've tried to be upfront but I don't think we're getting into the meat of things. It's almost like I'm getting better so they don't want to pick off a scab to reveal a wound.

I hear about other people who go to therapy and talk about pretty much whatever. Like if something bad happened that week, they bring it up to get help working through it if needed. That sounds more beneficial to me to almost discuss things as they come up while working on the persistent issues. It makes me feel like I'm getting the wrong type of therapy maybe.

What happens (loosely of course) in your sessions?"
Anxiety,DAE have noise anxiety?,"I’ve been sensitive to sudden and loud noises since I’ve been a kid. Automatic toilets, hand dryers, vacuum cleaners, fireworks, and blenders (to name a few) have always been extremely anxiety-inducing for me and give me that fight or flight feeling. However, I can perfectly handle things like a loud concert or a busy street, and my hearing isn’t that sensitive otherwise. Does anyone else relate?"
Anxiety,Anxiety is destroying me,"I've been fatal for several days, much worse than normal. Nothing I usually do works for me.

What do I do?"
Anxiety,awkward social interactions kill my vibe 👎,[removed]
Anxiety,Anyone on here take lansoprazole? just need some advice on it if possible.,I am on day 4 taking it and if anything i feel like i have more acid reflux than i have before. Can it increase acid before it gets better?
Anxiety,"I don’t think I’m pretty enough, and I’m okay marrying the guy that tried to rape me","A year and a half ago, a guy tried to take advantage of me. I was drunk in a bar, and he got me a water. Thirty minutes later, I was unable to walk or move. When getting escorted back to my room, he tried to stay with me, but another guy prevented him from doing so. I’m pretty sure he roofied me. I’ve always known what his intentions were, but I’m not turned off by what he did. 

If anything, I have feelings for him. No other guy has liked me that way before. Maybe there have been other guys who liked me, but none have ever been so overt about their interest in me. We’re still social media friends, and my hope is that we can get married and live happily ever after together. Another thing that didn’t help was that at the same time, a guy that I really liked had a girlfriend. He kept the fact that he had a girlfriend from me, and I was so disappointed. So I redirected my feelings for my crush onto this other guy. I feel like my original crush didn’t fight hard enough for me. Isn’t that what love’s all about? Fighting for someone, even when it’s difficult? 

Given how confident he was with me, he likely has done what he did to me before. It disgusts me if he has done it to other girls, but he did tell people that I was the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, so hopefully he only does bad stuff to me. I admit, I’m a virgin, never had a boyfriend before either. I want to have sex so bad. I know he’ll likely hurt me really bad, but he said that I’m the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen. He told mutual friends this. 

I want to get married to him and be financially dependent on him. I want to be pregnant with his children, and have lots of babies with him. Knowing what I know about him, he has some abusive tendencies, but not to worry. I won’t let him hurt our babies. I’ll redirect his anger and frustrations on me. No one has ever loved me before, and he’s the best I can do. I don’t want anyone else, just him. I know it’s likely that he may end up killing me. But I’ve been really depressed for years, and my one goal in life is to have children, so as long as my early death happens after I have children, I’ll be okay with that. 

I know it’s wrong. I know I should be disgusted by what he did. If a friend told me this happened to her, I’d tell her to run for the hills. But I don’t know. I’m 21 years old, and no guy has ever expressed any interest in me before. I want to get married and have babies, and if it means getting married to a monster, so be it. I can learn to love him, and he can learn to love me."
Anxiety,Anyone else just want to cut their legs off because how much restless you become of anxiety?,Someone just get these thoughts out of ny head. I walk and walk but the thoughts never go away. I'm so tired of thinking.
Anxiety,My anxiety just moves from on thing to the next,"I never get a break. If it's not this then it's that that causes me anxiety. I'm so tired and it just messes up my day. My mental health hasn't been good for the last 6 years, but I could still function more or less normal. But since August 2020 my mental health just plummeted. My anxiety is constantly high. It just goes from one thing to the next."
Anxiety,Very scared of losing my mind - need support,"Hey everyone, 

I am currently dealing with my relapse of anxiety and panic attacks. I have a pretty bad depersonalisation that pretty consistent for the past 2 months. I saw my therapist yesterday and he assured me that I don't have any signs of having schizophrenia or something like that. But my intrusive thoughts are so bad that I question my own memory. I ended up saying like, is this really happening? What if this is not real? I know it is real in a way cause it makes me terrified thinking that. I am not in a delusional space that I don't know what is real or not but also I am? I think I also have OCD cause I keep checking myself like make sure I hear a noise that is already there. My dog reacts to a noise as well and I say yes I actually heard it and it is real. Then I get panicky again because I need to check it to be able to say it is real and that to me is a sign of schizophrenia. You see the cycle here.... 

I literally don't trust my memory anymore cause everyday in a way is same. Waking up with anxiety and sleeping with anxiety. I am about to start my dream job in a month and I am so scared that I am gonna fuck it up. I am gonna end up questioning my reality. Even when I got the job the next day I woke up and said wow I can't believe I got this job, feels unreal. And had a panic attack because I thought about thinking that it feels unreal. I don't know if I am making any sense. This is suppose to me the happiest days of my life yet I am in this cloud, constantly questioning my sanity. Anxiety is shit. Please comment if you have symptoms like I do so I can have a little bit of relief."
Anxiety,Always think of worst-case scenario,"I'm planning on making a major life decision by accepting a teaching job in Vietnam. I've been there before, but that was 6 years ago. Some bad things happened last time. I ended up in a workplace that had cliques and I was isolated. I was bullied. I was in a relationship, but I was ghosted. I became an alcoholic. I became depressed. I could go on. My mind can't stop overthinking and imagining worst case scenarios. It's causing a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety in addition to suicidal thoughts. Here are some of the scenarios my mind is going through:

**Fact: It's past the deadline to make a decision for a job and the employer hasn't responded to my questions (some of which is my attempt to negotiate).** My mind: They're ghosting me or pressuring me into accepting their terms. If this job fails, I'm not going to be able to find another one because there's only a limited amount of reputable companies bring over teachers.

**Fact: I'll have to ride a motorbike 30-40min to work in Vietnam traffic (if my negotiations fail).** My mind: I'm going to die. Or, I'm going to hate my commute. It'll rain and I'll just get a taxi or a Grab anyway. Then at some point I'll end up a fatality statistic.

**Fact: I'm likely going to be offered drinks by colleagues/friends.** My mind: I'm on medication, and if I use that excuse not to drink in a country with a big drinking culture, I'm not going to have friends like last time. I'll be the black sheep and not part of the clique. Or if I drink, I'll have to stop my meds for depression, and I'll just kill myself or become super depressed and end up failing again and going home broke.

**Fact: There are big cockroaches in Vietnam and some of them entered my apartment last time I was in the country. I'm afraid of them (when they enter my apartment.)** My mind: I'm going to have to sleep in the one-man collapsable tent that I bought for the sole purpose of being safe from bugs. I'll have to sleep with the lights on. Whatever apartment I decide on, the landlord is going to lie about there not being an infestation.

**Fact: I was ghosted in my first and only relationship while I was over there. It hurt like hell, but I deserved it.** My mind: I'm just going to become needy like last time and end up pushing someone away. I'll overinvest early in the relationship. I'll get hurt again in the same way. Then, I'll become resentful and end up on bad subreddits like last time.

How do I stop ruminating, overthinking, and thinking of the worst-case scenario regarding this? I am so tired from overthinking. I just want my mind to stop."
Anxiety,Need help,"I fear criticism so much so that I start feeling breathless before every meeting at work place. I don't really know what to do. My hands get cold and I can barely move.

Someone please help me out I'm tired of being this way. I always try to be strong but end up all broken up before meeting. 
Not that I actually get criticism, but even the possibility of it haunts me at night."
Anxiety,Anxious because of job,"My work here is much more demanding then any work I have ever done. I received a warning for my performance and she gave me 2 weeks to prove myself. I am doing the best I can to do just that, but I feel constantly anxious. I am very scared of losing this job. She even told me that she is an inpatient person that cannot tolerate mistakes. I've been at this job for 1 month only and I don't want to go back to job searching."
Anxiety,coping with anxiety at work,"I have been suffering with severe GAD and MDD for the oast 1.5 years. I have a job but am struggling to keep it. 
I can feel myself tense and get worked up over a task or a meeting. I sm exhausted with sweating, air hunger, headaches, tense muscles and at the end of the day, even if I don't do much, I'm so tired that I can't even move a muscle. I don't take medication. I exercise and meditate. Please let me know any tips to cope with this."
Anxiety,How to deal with medicine side effects?,"I have been taking 20mg of paroxetine (seroxat) daily since december and I have found it difficult to fall asleep at night due to lots of energy and I wake up tired and not wanting to leave bed. Because of this I have started to take 2.5 mg of valium to help me fall asleep and in the morning in order to wake up, I need more than just a coffee, I have started to drink an energy drink so I can ""wake up"". I want to avoid taking this in order to do trivial things in life. How can I cope with the medicine side effects?"
Anxiety,What is like to feel anxious 24/7 ?,"I used to be anxious in certain situations because of social anxiety. Now, I am anxious 24/7. 

I feel paralyzed and unable to take a break from anxiety for days. 

Please tell me your experience, and any ways you use to stop the anxiety, even for an hour."
Anxiety,I really thought that having a cold bath would somehow lessen my anxiety,"Took a long cold bath hoping that all my worries would ease up ‘cos I’ve been feeling uneasy the whole day. I feel like I’m panicking and having trouble breathing. Feels like I can’t really help myself. Also had the thought again to end things but snapped back ‘cos I don’t want to leave my partner behind and face all of the responsibilities I’m leaving behind. 😪 I really don’t know what to do anymore.

I’ve been posting for so many times already (I think) I hope I can just put myself in a box because I’m really not feeling good anymore. And don’t want to be a burden to anybody

I’m not really making any sense here.."
Anxiety,I don't know what else to do and feeling hopeless,"I exercise 3 times a week and even when I don't, I always go for a 40-45 minute walk every day.

I read some books on different psychology topics, they were helpful but of course it's not that they will magically make anxiety and dpdr disappear, and they all seemed a bit too much superficial.

I am doing mindfullness every day almost (maybe I can work on quality and duration).

I have always had a good diet, never drink coffee, alcohol or other drugs.

Been on therapy for 1 year and it feels just a waste of money.

I am starting to feel hopeless, I don't know what more I can do, I'm sick of just surviving and fighting always with this bs symptoms. What have I even done to deserve this?"
Anxiety,I'm anxious and worried about war,[removed]
Anxiety,Anxiety from overthinking,"Hey guys. I need some advice on how to not care what others think of me. I waste all my energy daily on trying to figure out if people are mad at me…etc. This typically happens at work daily but recently it has made its way into my interactions with my family. For example, if my sister doesn’t  text me back for a couple days, my mind starts racing about what I may of done to make her mad or why she may not want to talk to me. Another recent example of how it’s effecting my family life, my mother invited me to go to the store with her to shop and I said no because I was not feeling the best and I beat myself up about it all day long thinking I made her mad and it got to the point where I got emotional, broke down and apologized for saying no! I don’t understand why I’m like this. I try to tell myself that people have lives and just because they may not be overly friendly to me at work..etc, doesn’t mean I did something wrong to them! Does any one else deal with this type of anxiety? Sometimes I make myself go into a full blown panic attack with racing thoughts of what I did to these people to make them mad at me (even though they aren’t even mad at me in the slightest!) help!"
Anxiety,Can't eat due to being out of my comfort zone,"So, I started a new job yesterday and after being in a job where I felt super comfortable with the work and people for 4 years, I'm way out of my comfort zone. My anxiety levels are so high, they haven't been this high for a long time and due to this I can't seem to eat anything because I feel really nauseous.

I'm quite thin anyway so I can't afford to lose any more weight.

I keep telling myself this feeling will pass. It's just because my surroundings are new and I don't know anyone.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What was your experience?"
Anxiety,"I've inhaled drain cleaner ""smoke"" when I was putting it into the siphon. Physically, nothing happened and I'm fine, but it triggered a massive panic attack in me as I'm hypochondric.","The panic lasted for I guess an hour or so. Now, as I'm kinda calmed down, I just feel drained, exhausted without energy, like having a flu. Funnily enough, my back hurts out of a sudden, which can be a consequence of having a panic attack as I've read. I just want to lie down in bed and sleep, and do nothing. 

I'll skip classes today though. Just wanted to share that with you, maybe you'll know what to tell me what I should do. I'm thinking about getting some CBD as there's a shop 5min next to me.

Kind of feel like BoJack Horseman when he was driving through America after he suffered a panic attack on the set when he was doing the new Horsin Around show after Sarah Lynn died."
Anxiety,What physical symptoms did you get from constant anxiety?,I recently developed constant health anxiety and have felt numerous physical symptoms which worries me even more and the cycle doesn’t stop. Just wondering what physical symptoms did you guys get from anxiety and how did you stop your anxiety from manifesting?
Anxiety,It seems like progress has been made✨✨,"I've been afraid of social situations for the last 4 years and it became worse due to the lockdowns!! BUT rn I've survived through 2 weeks of physical school and I'm also a month sh clean!! VERY proud of myself and glad I've been trying to get better!!

I've also been trying to get better with my anxiety around food intake and my body image!! Not really doing the best with that one but issokayyyy!!

I've made a good amount of friends in school and i also managed to get invited for a movie AHHHHH it's exciting, scary but still exciting!! 

Ive been trying to be patient and understanding with myself, my body and mind!! I'm understanding my patterns, triggers and moods!! I wish I had access to a good professional but I'm too scared of them after my last experience and i think I'm gonna take my own time with that :) 

I hope everyone here is doing well too!! Remember that you're strong enough and I'm always here of anyone needs someone to talk to :)"
Anxiety,How do you guys earn an income?,I need an income but I get overwhelmed even by low stress jobs. Am I just fucked?
Anxiety,Anxious about my commute due to road rage,"I'm sorry in advance for the length of this post! So just for some context I am based in the UK and changed jobs a few months ago and my new commute just seems to be full of angry drivers.

In the last 2 weeks alone I've been yelled at at traffic lights and antogonised by someone after I'd honked my horn because they overtook me dangerously. I would not say I'm the best driver in the world or that I've never made a mistake while driving but I do my best to leave good gaps and not be reckless or dangerous. Anytime I have done something stupid it has just been a mistake with no malice behind it and I will happily admit to my mistakes. 

Today was the worst incident so far. I was at a roundabout turning left at the first exit, there was a car who was in the right hand lane coming around the roundabout. For this car to leave at the next exit (the same one I wanted to use) you'd need to be in the left hand lane or at least indicating to go into that lane. Since they were doing neither of these things I pulled out. They then merged into the left lane and honked at me. I admit they had to brake fairly hard so I flashed my hazard lights as an apology, I truly didn't believe they were using the same exit as me. They preceeded to hold down their horn and were inches from my back bumper. I was near work so I turned off toward my gated workplace and  they followed, I assumed we worked at the same place. I scanned my card to get through the barriers and noticed them turning around to leave. I realised at that point that they must have gone that way just to follow me.

 I am now full of so much anxiety what if they come back after I leave work to yell at me or something? What if I run into them again and they recognise me?
I truly didn't mean to inconvenience them, it was a mistake and I think could have happened to anyone, and just thinking I might get verbally assaulted or worse for making an error on the road is just making me feel so anxious. 

TLDR: After a near miss on the road a driver followed me to work but turned around without doing anything and now I'm nervous about driving my commute."
Anxiety,Im pretty terrified right now,"My brother goes outside very often and he is 9 years old.
He's been having a fever for two days now , and today he woke up with difficulty to swallow juice and a bad neck pain.
There is a lot of wild dogs where I live so I am really afraid he has picked up rabies , but my mother (who is a pharmacist) keeps insisting he will be fine.
I used to get a fever like that as a kid but I am really worried for my brother."
Anxiety,How can I stop the “What-if” scenarios in my brain from ruining my day? Why do they pop up all the time.,
Anxiety,Sertraline side effect,"So I (21M) started a course of sertraline tablets (50mg) just over 2 weeks ago, and I have been having a big increase in long, well ""sustained"" erections. The usual side effects of sertraline says that difficulty getting it up and actually cuming is common, and yes one of those is true as it does take a long time to reach orgasm, however I can't seem to find any other text on other people having the opposite side effect to trouble with getting a hard on. It doesn't take anything to set it off, it's rock solid and really sensitive, and can sometimes last 40mins to an hour. 

Don't know if its something I should be worried about or if it's just a natural side effect given the drug changing my brain chemistry. Mainly making the post to make sure I've not got some weird 1 in a million side effect."
Anxiety,Need help regard psychiatrist,"I visited a psychiatrist 10 days ago. I thought I had Adhd we talked barely ten minutes and she gave some meds and tests to get done. Test were Adhd and MCMI. I did test with psychologist she refered. They were questionnaire. So no Adhd on test and have Anxiety on it. ""These test are supposed to just hypothesize about patient condition and need to confirm with other clinical information"". This is written under the test results. So I visited my psychiatrist again today, she just asked how was meds, prescribed new meds and refered another psychologist for therapy session and told me that psychologist will talk to you about future progress and done. Thats it. When I questioned her about can you explain the reports she straight up said no,  psychologist will do it.
I mean no explaining about reports or asking about my childhood or anything at all and straight up therapy. And its a hell lot expensive. I don't if this is the procedure or not?

My symptoms
Overthinking everything
Excessive forgetfulness
Lack of motivation

I imagined meeting psychiatrist and having a good conversation about my problems but that was uncomfortable experience. I don't if I should continue visiting her or change psychiatrist?"
Anxiety,I have unbearable anxiety right now I'm afraid I'm gonna die of it,Right now I feel so much anxiety and my heartbeat is increasing so fast it's like a panic attack please I think I'm gonna have an heart failure but I would be happy because I can't sustain ot anymore please I need oxygen
Anxiety,this sub helped me sm today,"i had to do a presentation today in class in front of maybe 60 students i was TERRIFIED i took propranolol and while waiting for my part i was on here, i searched “presentation” and just read everyones comments helping others and it was so so insightful it calmed me down a lot.

for the presentation i got way too lucky, professor was running out of time and she asked our group to keep it as short as possible 2 sentences max and she’ll give us our grade based on our delivery so my 5 minutes of script i had memorized and practiced everyday was cut to a barely 20 seconds of an abbreviated version of what i prepared, not complaining at all lol.

i was still too nervous to look at anyone in the audience but that’s for another day to tackle..

at the end of the day this just shows how much my anxiety is so set to catastrophize everything, i was stressing about this the moment i heard a presentation was required just imagining the worst possible outcome it ruined a lot of days for me because its all i could think about.

what ended up happening was the total opposite. i enjoyed preparing with my group i was able to stay calm and crack jokes with people i’ve just met and i didn’t shake i didn’t stutter and i did not embarrass my myself i had sm fun today, not at all what my anxiety was telling me for the past three weeks.

as small as this is it seemed impossible for me to do something like this and im really proud of myself."
Anxiety,Want to talk about anticipatory anxiety :),"So I recently joined these 9 hour lectured held on tuesday every week.  And it was absolute hell for me because I have anticipatory anxiety and on top of that I was attending alone. It was so severe that I had anxiety on wednesday about the class im about to attend next tuesday. Anxiety 6 days in advance :(

After getring fed up with having these anxietic thoughts I turned to self help books. One that helped me the most was ""power of now"" in which the author said that as long as you ground your thoughts/mind in the presence, you cannot get anxiety. This did work to some extent but the issue is, soon as you let your guard down, intrusive anxiety causing thoughts flood your mind. So it wasn't reliable and i learnt that the hard way when I had a nervous breakdown 2nd week after i came back home because I was trying so hard to block my thoughts that it was stressing me out too much.

So i gave up trying to fix my anxiety issues. gave up reading self help books, reading reddit posts on anxiety fixes and hopelessly attended lectures for 2 more weeks. Wanna hear something funny? the anxiety went from 90% to 5% on these 2 weeks i attended lectures without trying to fight anxeity. bruh. -_-


I've learnt 2 important lessons from this. In dealing with my anxiety, just sucking it up was way more effective than trying to fight or avoid it.

Eventhough I have heard of this quote before millions of times, I've never had an experience i could associate with it. But now I do

Lesson 2 : anticipatory anxiety is basically our subconcious mind fearing all possible ways an event could go wrong. But in reality almost all situations fall into a template and when you face a certain situation regularly for mutiple times, your subconcious realizes that template and no longer bothers you with reminding you 1000 ways how that event could go wrong."
Anxiety,DAE get weird feelings in their head/neck?,"i’ve been experiencing weird feelings, kind of like giddy/fuzzy feelings in my head - particularly at the back and down my neck. I also feel like my head is restless and i have to move it. Is this a common symptom with anxiety and does anyone else experience this?"

Anxiety,"Don't want to move forward with my life, I want to remain where I am","Does anybody else feel this way? It's like this weird double layer thing where the obvious thing is the uncertainty of the future is making me anxious, but it's also the *certainty* of some things that make me anxious. Like, just the fact that I will eventually have to work a job, probably 5 days a week for 8 hours a day (or at the very least somewhere in that ballpark.) and I can't even imagine doing that because it feels so not like me, not like a thing I should be doing with my life. I've been successfully avoiding work/a job so far. I'm 23 and now starting my fourth semester at university. But that's stressing me out, too. In the past 3 semesters I have passed exactly one exam. It's all been online because of Covid and the last semester I didn't even bother attending the online classes after like week two. And I am scared about going back to uni next week when classes start again. But I know I have to. I have to catch up 3 semesters, so I have to retake my early courses, I have to do *something* with my life because I am not allowed to just exist. I am not allowed to just find a place in my life where I am comfortable and just stay there. I don't want much out of life, you know, I don't need a big house or apartment, I don't need impressive accomplishments or anything. I'm fine with the apartment I am in now, I'm fine with my low level of luxury I have now. It wasn't always like this. I wasn't fine with where I was two years ago, but I am fine with where I am now, so why can't I just stay here, at this point of my life, for the rest of it. Why do I have to keep moving? Why do I have to keep changing what my life is? It just doesn't feel right. I stay up late because I don't want the days to end and then I stay in bed too long because I don't want a new day to start. Because it's one step closer to change. One day closer to all new anxiety inducing things that for some reason have to happen in life. I just want to stop moving forward."
Anxiety,Anxiety from being Trapped,"I usually avoid crowds. So, it's been a long time since I've experienced this. Earlier today, a tall man blocked my ""escape"" from a corner of a room. I'm still feeling wigged about it. Of course, there was no real danger. But, I felt the surge of panic building. I told him he was blocking me, and he didn't move. I gestured for him to move and he finally did. Now that I reflect on it, his position was either blatantly stupid or purposefully anxiety-provoking. Now I just feel a little angry by it. I feel men especially should know not to block women in."

Anxiety,pushing myself to go on a date tomorrow (terrified!),"my mental health has been so bad this year that for the past month that ive actually been off sick from work with a doctors note because i began the month in a state of catatonic depression triggered by a sudden breakup this year that sent me spiralling. 

since then ive been pushing myself to go out more as i noticed my anxiety was peaking. at the supermarket i was feeling my heart rate go up, the paranoia of people staring at me, the fiddling of clothes with my hands just it all felt like i was back at square one. ive always had social anxiety but this year it’s returned to its worst. but fighting against it as best i can, ive been travelling to meet friends, going on nights out/activities before my sick note ends to really throw myself back into the life that ive been missing out on this year before heading back to work. 

i’ve been speaking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks now. he lives about half an hour away and he is 100% my type in literally every conceivable way??? it’s as if i had created him myself if that makes sense. when he asked me out i was delighted but then the dread crept in. 

ive never been on a date with somebody ive never met before. i know he is who he says he is that’s not the issue, im just so so terrified ill embarrass myself. that’s where most of my social anxiety comes from, this fear of judgement and people laughing at me that’s invaded my life all these years. im scared ill trip up or say the wrong thing or spill a drink. and at the end of the day i truly don’t expect anything from the date, i know im going because we get on well, he’s funny and kind, i might as well whilst i have the time with my sick note’s final week and he’s so my type that id be a fool not to go meet up with him. i know the likelihood is nothing will come from it and that’s fine because it’s been a great boost getting to know him and he’d be an amazing friend, too! and if it does go further then also great! and if neither happens then my life will go on as usual. my fears for the date aren’t anything to do with that aspect of it, i just don’t want to embarrass myself and it’s holding me back so much

i just wish this fear of making a fool of myself would stop holding me back and i am begging myself not to cancel on this man because of my own insecurities about things i know deep down probably won’t even happen?? so why is this controlling my life so much??"
Anxiety,I don't really know how to put this in words,I feel anxious but at the same time I don't. My mind is running a million miles and I feel like my soul is far away and I'm just watching my body as an outsider. But my body looks droopy. I'm slouched and my eyes look dazed. But I don't have that panicky feeling that I usually do when I'm anxious. I recognize that I need a break and I've scheduled ample breaks throughout the day. I've tried calming myself by my usual means but it isn't working because I feel anxious but at the same time I don't. I really don't understand. Help please?
Anxiety,Has anyone's anxiety increased even you are on meds for a year?," I've been on anxiety's treatment with meds (and medical follow up, of course) since November, 2020. During this period we had to adjust the medication, I felt that my anxiety was decreasing... Everything seems to be working. 

Last year I spent 4 months in my native county, at my parents house, and I didn't have much trouble with my anxiety there. But, since I went back to where I live, I noticed that my anxiety is increasing and I'm already  feeling the same way that I was without meds/at the treatment beginning. 

I already talked to my doctor about it, but until now he hasn't changed anything... I just wanna know if anyone has had this experience?


Ps: Right now I'm taking Venlafaxina, Bupropiona and Venvanse at morning and Duloxetina at night."

Anxiety,Crippling anxiety gang wooo and I’m too young to deal with it on my own and my mom is unsupportive as all fuck,"I’m probably not too young to deal with it on my own, I mean I’m pretty sure I need medication at this point. I’m seeing a therapist and the meditation, positive affirmations shit doesn’t work. Like I know I’ll be fine doing whatever it is that’s making me anxious but I’m still anxious. Like I know school/work will be fine and if I put in the effort I will be okay!! It will be fine!! But the days before it I just can’t relax, I can’t enjoy anything bc I’m constantly worrying… I’m having severe constipation issues due to stress despite eating well, drinking plenty of water, and using laxatives/stool softeners… 

I’m 20, and I work a part time job given I’m in nursing school, so I’m willing to pay for the meds. However I know nothing of how the real world works bc my mom hasn’t taught me anything. She doesn’t want me to take anxiety meds bc she says they’re all benzodiazepines even though that’s not true idk why she’s saying that when she’s forcing me into nursing school so I know that’s not true…. (I don’t really have an interest in anything else other than nursing tho for the money) I just feel like at this rate I need meds and my therapist even suggested it before I started feeling this anxious but I told her I wanted to try more things like meditation/yoga/exercise/positive affirmations but honestly it’s not working it’s not enough. For example I literally KNOW nothing bad will happen at school or work and I KNOW everything gonna be okay and I’ll be fine, but I’m just so anxious for no fucking reason"
Anxiety,So I think I may have had a panic attack,"*not asking for medical diagnosis* just feedback. 

I woke up last night while being on the verge of sleep I believe with my heart RACING. It was going so fast and reminded me of when I used to take ecstacy (been a few years ago no correlation). It was very scary and I wavered on whether to call the ambulance for a few minutes. I felt like I was going to throw up

Sn: (even writing this description has me tearing up right now)

So I walk a few feet to my bathroom, turn on the lights and try to orient myself all the while trying not to move too much for fear of accelerating my heart. It wasn't until I laid back down that my heart started to calm down. But then a few minutes later, it came right back. Heart rate shot up. This time I got dressed to go to the ER. After I got dressed, my hr went back down so I decided to lay back down....

THEN I started shivering. Badly. And it increased in waves. I started getting super clammy hands and it was very hard to regulate my temperature. I was in a t shirt and underwear but felt sweaty. I get up to get dressed and my legs are TREMORING really badly. Like debilitatingly so. It was harder to get dressed this time. Idk why but I laid back down and tried to calm down again. After a few minutes, I felt like maybe a change of environment would help so I went to my guest bedroom and fell asleep within 10 minutes.

This was one of the scariest things I've experienced ( at leastsince I took too much ecstacy in 2014).

Background: I did smoke before bed but have absolutely never had an adverse reaction to weed. I've been really pushing myself the last few weeks driving for Uber to pay off credit cards so I definitely have not been taking care of myself. Work the last couple weeks and the next few weeks has been and will be very stressful so I'm sure that contributed to it. But I've never had my body react like this before and felt specifically like a panic attack but Idk. I read a few posts on this sub describing panic attacks and started crying cause it matched up so closely."
Anxiety,Catastrophizing,"My anxiety is part of my PMDD, and manageable with hydroxyzine most of the time.

Usually, I have general anxiety for 24-48 hours, and then I'm fine until the next monthly cycle.

The past few days, I've been having extreme swings from feeling fine to catastrophizing, and I wish I was dead. (Not going to self-harm or anything, just wish I didn't have to live like this.)

My condition didn't even begin until August 2021...how in the hell do people live like this for years?"
Anxiety,Any tips for managing email-related anxiety?,"So, I just had to send an email to one of my lecturers asking a question about something, and it's made me really anxious. Every time I send an email, I start worrying about how it comes across, if I'm saying the right thing, if I sound unprofessional. I reread it like ten times before I send it, and I put off pressing send for as long as possible. Honestly, I'd rather never ask anything than have to ask in an email, but that's not really an option. 

So does anyone have any tips for managing anxiety about sending emails?"
Anxiety,How long do effects linger after a major attack?,"I had my first real genuine full blown anxiety/panic attack 2 days ago while 3 hours from home, and after calming down enough to have a friend drive me back I haven't been the same? I've always suffered from overthinkong and slight/mild panic attacks that usually start and end within 5 minutes. However I just can't fully shake this one, it's gotten better but as things stand I can't muster the courage to leave my house for more than a few hours and the thought of going back to work or doing anything scares me because of the possibility of another attack. 

My real question here is, how long does the lingering effects last for anyone that has gone through anything similar? The rest of the day after the attack i couldn't fully relax/calm down until I was staying still/laying down. Yesterday I woke up fine but as soon as I got about my day to go to the doctor the slight shaky feeling and constant panic was there but not major. While sitting in the doctor's office I felt fine, and after eating and moving there was slight scared moments but overall no attacks but again once I was in my room and laying down I felt calm and could sleep or watch my show. 

Right now I'm sitting at a park overall relaxed but my head still feels off? I'm tired often and Not so much overthinking but I can't focus nor concentrate, it feels like my head has this pressure in it. The doctors did an EKG to check my heart and there was nothing wrong there, he just recommended an MRI and diet/exercise change. I'm still waiting on the MRI results though. I've had these tension headaches prior so I feel like the anxiety attack I had is just trying to convince me that this is related, but I figured I'd ask here to see if anyone else has felt the same. I just feel like there's no going back, and I will always feel a slight panic :(

The doctor prescribed me .5 of Xanax to take daily as needed but I haven't taken any, I have them there if I have a bad attack similar to what caused this"
Anxiety,Buspirone,I’m currently taking Buspirone 10mg 2x daily. It seem to work at first but not so much now. Plus it was my first time on it so my question is does it mean I need a higher dose now.

Anxiety,Car anxiety and worrying about losing my job,"I have a service appointment scheduled in a few days for my car (which has 122k miles so far) which I depend upon to get to/from work. I have constant anxiety now that the dealership will call me and tell me that there's a major issue with the car that'll cost thousands to fix (which I don't have). If that's the case, then I'll lose my job and have bill collectors harassing me since it's very difficult for me to find work being neurodivergent and all.

I wish there was something that could ease my mind about this, as I feel miserable now and am starting to have trouble staying asleep."
Anxiety,Why is finding a therapist so difficult,"Honestly I want to give up on finding one even though I KNOW deep down how badly I need to find a professional I can trust to talk to. My first experience with trying to look for help was in high school for body image issues/EDs. The counselor I met with just looked at me and said it was “a load of horseshit” that I see myself that way lol. And that’s basically it. “Wow thanks sir, my ED is cured now” 🙄

Anyways that turned me off from seeking therapy for about a decade and in the meantime, my anxiety has just been festering and growing to the point it’s affecting my physical health. I had a recent health scare where I felt/had all the symptoms of a heart attack and went to the ER just to be told there’s nothing wrong with me. Besides just general existential anxiety, life has recently thrown me a huge financial stressor that’s ever-present in the back of my head, and my physical symptoms, like difficulty breathing, have just gotten worse and more frequent. 

I tried Cerebral for a couple weeks (the online therapy app) thinking that would be a “gentle” way to get into therapy, but they just wanted to prescribe me meds right off the bat and the talking session felt very generic/textbook. I didn’t really feel like I was heard as an individual at all, more like treated as “just another anxiety patient”. I personally don’t want to go on meds because I already have anxiety over health issues and I don’t want to deal with any possible side effects. 

Anyways now I’m doing what my friend suggested by looking for therapists on PsychologyToday but most either don’t seem to be accepting new clients, and the ones that do that I emailed just straight up ghosted me lol. Idk just give me a reason to push through with finding a therapist/I’m open to any other suggestions. I just feel like giving up"
Anxiety,Anyone struggling with head spasms(involuntary head twitching) ?,It's really so much. I can bear with it when I'm alone but in public I keep on trying to controle it although it's so hard cause I can't let people see that. It's so tiring.
Anxiety,"Starting a new job soon, need to reverse my sleeping pattern. Advice?","I don’t want to post this on insomnia, because I actually sleep consistently at the same time, issue is that time is 6am. I’m just nervous about how I’ll manage to do this.

I’ve been jobless for a couple months and I’ve fallen into sleeping around 6 and waking up around 2. The clocks went forward the other day and this has made it worse. Today I woke up at gone 3pm. 

I start a new job for the summer soon where I should be out of the house by 9. I don’t think I’m gonna be able to adjust my sleeping pattern gradually, because every time I try to set an alarm even for 12, when I don’t have anywhere to be that day, I don’t even remember turning off the alarm and just wake up later.

Any advice for how I can adjust myself to waking up early in a short amount of time? I figured worst case it’s just a rough first week, but I’m honestly worried having no sleep will make me feel anxious or cause my to panic while learning a new job."
Anxiety,Creating a resume/cv is hard if you have extremely low self-esteem. Any thoughts or recommendations?,"I'm advised to take internships to boost my chances for grad school. The thing is, I can't write a decent resume without thinking that that's not me, I can't do any job well. I kind of don't even want to say that I have imposter syndrome because that implies that I have a highly adept intellectual ability to doubt upon. 

Honestly, I focus on team-based project experiences just so I can't deny the accomplishments made. I've written numerous research papers with my groupmates and, for most of them, acted as project manager tasked with allocating time, delegating tasks and writing progress reports. 

I can somewhat acknowledge my importance and relevance to a team but I can't find my individual skills valuable, if that makes sense. 

It's when I am confident that I can contribute to a research paper but it'll surely be abysmal if I write by myself. What does that mean about me and how can I improve my outlook on myself?"
Anxiety,I made it through a job interview!!,"I’m visibly shaking right now, but I did it. I made it through the anticipatory anxiety, the panic of “oh my god. Ok. I’m in the interview room” and the after-anxiety of What Ifs and What I Should Have Dones.

I’m proud of myself for getting this far and working through my panic and fear. I stumbled through my words sometimes and forgot a lot of the things I wanted to say, but I feel like I made a good impression.

Even if I don’t get the job, I know I can be proud of myself for getting this far. It took a lot of steps to get here and I did it!!"
Anxiety,"First time, need guidance","Hi all!

Not sure where to start. Normally im a young energetic guy that doesnt worry. 1 week ago I tried ritalin as a ""fun"" thing. My friend said 5 minutes after taking the tablet that as long as I dont have any problems with psychosis or the like im ok...thats where I think I got a panic attack. I personally dont have any history of psychosis. Not at all. But my brother has some form of schizophrenia. So I think I literally panicked and thought id ruined my life. I got dizzy and had to lie down.

Next day was ok didnt sleep much. The following days I had a big test for university and then work...slept bad, ate bad...etc

Started reading about schizophrenia and thought I was developing it. Which im clearly not lol. I remember how my brother was when he got sick. Im not like that. Anyway I got a panic attack I think at work and had to go home.

My big issue the past week is the insane dizzyness/vertigo. I think its from anxiety. Does anyone here recognize this? Will it go over? Ive never had this dizzyness feeling before...ive never had an issue with anxiety before. But I definitely feel like the past week ive worried a LOT."
Anxiety,Psych recommended Prozac…,"Hi! As the total states my psychiatrist suggested Prozac for my anxiety, as I already do all of the good things like exercise, meditate, journal etc. I have unspecified anxiety.

I’m a little stressed about this tbh because as a teen I was put on Zoloft and was very numbed and emotionless and I’m worried that Prozac would do this. I used to take Zoloft for depression but depression is not an issue for me anymore. It was likely situation based when I was a teen.

Does anyone have experience with this med?"

Everyone is so happy I just can't I have to put a fake face on and get on with it ."
Anxiety,I am so unbelievably humiliated,"A bit of context for the full story:

Since i’m currently deciding what i want to do career wise, i still live with my parents, so i try my best to keep things clean and help out around the house. But sometimes i get into really bad depression episodes, and i let trash and dirty laundry pile up for weeks until i get the motivation to clean. 

That being said, today is my day off of work where i planned to clean my entire room. My parents forgot to mention a woman they hired to help clean came today. I had to awkwardly greet her unshowered with no bra, then take my phone and rush downstairs where i’m currently hiding in a pile of blankets. This poor woman has to somehow vacuum a carpet covered in clothes and pet hair, dust around empty cups and packages, and worst of all, clean my stained toilet that i got glitter stuck on the inside to due to an art project gone wrong. I’m so afraid she thinks im some weird lazy kid who never cleans and just leaves my shit everywhere and lives like a gross slob. I know this probably isn’t the worst she’s seen, but my messy rooms are one of my major insecurities. I don’t know if i want advice or am just venting, i just hate how i’m an adult and still have trouble taking care of myself.

TLDR: my room is a disaster and unbelievably messy, and i didn’t know someone hired to clean was coming until they were already in my room."

Anxiety,"Constant heavy breathing, elevated heart rate and extreme restlessness due to anxiety + back problems + questionable medicine advice by personal doctor. PLEASE HELP","I suffer from generalized and health anxiety and have for the most part been doing okay for the last 2-3 years. That changed quickly at the start of last week. I have scheuermann's disease which resulted in some pain in my back when I was a kid and did sports actively. I also have a slight scoliosis of my thoracic spine which has caused my left shoulder to be a little uneven. I haven't had much pain in either for a long time (mostly just an uncomfortable feeling in the shoulder) but I started feeling it and it kicked my anxiety into over-drive. When it got better a few days later the anxiety had taken over instead.

I am prescribed 450mg of lyrica (pregabalin) for the anxiety which I have been taking for years. Besides that I was also prescribed 2.5mg diazepam to help me fall asleep. My doctor did not properly inform me how long it actually stays in the body. The impression I got was that I just shouldn't take it every day. I took 2-3 pills per week for a few months and when my anxiety got bad I took one for 3 days straight. I then took 1.25mg the next 2 days and then tried to stop cold turkey. It made the anxiety even worse. On the 4th day I caved and took 2.5mg again. I then went 3 days without taking them before taking one gain. Its nearly impossible for me to fall asleep. I'm deathly afraid of dying or building up so much stress that I'll get the consequences in just a few years. On the worst days I can hardly focus or stay still for even small amounts of time. Even though I took the combination of Pregabalin and Diazepam semi-regularly for months I'm still kinda afraid of what its doing to me now. My short term memory is terrible and I feel exhausted groggy and confused. The lack of sleep doesn't help. I also am scared of it affecting my breathing.

I want to taper off it but my doctor is convinced I shouldn't have any issues dropping the 2.5mg just like that. Her only other advice was to cut the (already halved) pills in half to make approx. 1.25mg pills. The smallest diazepam pill you can get here is 5mg. They had a 2mg but they discontinued it which seems super silly based on everything I know about it now. I think it might be possible to split them more if you order it specifically somehow but I don't know.. Even if it was I don't think my doctor would agree to it.

I have no idea what to do about my medicine. Or my anxiety. Or my life in general. Exercise would be a great way (and was for a few days) to improve but my back started hurting again 2 days ago. Even just walking for an extended period of time starts to bring on pain. I have no idea what to do."

I feel that I couldn’t do more, it’d stress me to be on my phone all day. But I don’t care if I have a million unopened chats. Anyone is the same?

I have been trying for years with doctors and various mental health professionals, but every single one makes my anxiety so bad that I can't cope and often I just don't attend the appointment.

And I just feel so depressed as well. Like i see people at work just going on with their lives and I feel so empty. Like i feel nothing but everything. all at once. 

I feel like I don't deserve anything good because I am not capable of acknowledging it. I wish I could go back when I could feel things. Now, I only know how to be anxious.

I just want this to stop my chest is pounding and I’m shaking so bad. I feel bad about calling into work because of my anxiety as well but I can’t eat or sleep so I would be useless anyways. I just need some reassurance and any coping skills anyone thinks could be helpful during this time. I just feel so unsafe in my own home right now.
Anxiety,"How do you deal with worries about the basics of life, such as aging, loneliness and death?","Hello all,

I am looking for a bit of advice in hopefully rewiring my thought process. I am fully aware that we are all aging, we are all going to die sooner or later, most of us will lose our parents during our lifetimes, some of us will lose their husbands and wives... This happens to every single one of us, yet I find it very difficult to deal with this reality of life.

Not all the time, but sometimes I get into a circle of thoughts that only imagines the worst outcome. I can't even think of an option to replace them with their positive versions. Things that go through my head are:

* I am likely to lose my partner before I die (we have a 20+ years age difference). I love my partner so very much and been together for the past 15 years.
* Repeat: I am likely to lose my partner before I die. How will I cope with being alone? We only have each other and we know a very few people one can call a ""friend."" We have been completing each other in many aspects of life. How will I cope without my partner being around?
* I am likely to lose my mother and father before I die. Moreover, what will happen when one of them dies and the other one stays on his/her own? I live in another country. My sister lives in another city. How are they going to cope being alone?
* Repeat: I am likely to lose my mother and father before I die. I visit them at least twice a year. Most years, three times. How will I feel when they die? How will I cope with being in the same house they used to live?
* How will I cope when I am on my own, get old, get sick? How will I survive?

You see, the above list happens to most of us. Maybe not so if there is no such a big age gap between you and your partner, but still, one of you is likely to pass earlier than the other.

I am 38 years old. Some would say 'you are in the prime of your life, go and enjoy the life' but over the past 6 months or so, these thoughts are all over my mind and impact the quality of my life.

**TL;DR: How do you cope with worries about life events such as loss of a parent, loss of a loved one, or you aging, getting old, needing to be looked after.**

Anxiety,Helping Partner with Anxiety/control issues,"My SO and I have been married 10.5yrs and known each other for probably 15 or so and while she's had anxiety issues throughout our relationship they've been becoming more apparent recently when it relates to our 9yo daughter with some issues she's having with friends at school. She has not seeked out treatment/a therapist and tries to deal with everything herself and I want to do whatever I can to help her. I have always not been a ""feelings"" person (my family never discussed things like that, swept things under the rug) so it's been difficult for me to empathize with how she's feeling and how I can help. I take the ""if it's broke let's fix it"" approach which is 100% wrong here and I've learned that the hard way.

I've been researching how to support a spouse with anxiety issues and found [this article](https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/how-to-help-partner-with-anxiety/) with some high level tips that are helpful but this was the most impactful thing I found:

&gt;In a long-term relationship, there can be pressure on the partner who doesn’t have anxiety to know exactly how to handle the anxiety situation or support their partner without being told.

That's 100% how I would describe our interactions when my spouse is under stress and/or in a situation where she feels out of control. I feel the expectation is that I'll be able to recognize that and start helping to make things better right away and when that doesn't happen things turn negative extremely fast with the negativity typically being the first verbal communication we'll have about the situation.

Recently, when I have tried to start or continue conversations related to stressful situations (with her or related to our daughter) it's typically met with resistance and comments that I'm only asking for myself and don't really care about her/how things are effecting her. I'm not sure if it's the timing, our history of me not doing well in these situations or both but very rarely do these conversations progress well and have her open up.

It's also clear she still doesn't feel like she can be 100% open/vulnerable with me and tell me how she's truly feeling. I'm guessing this contributes to the swings I see from things being good between us to extreme negativity when she's feeling the fight or flight reaction as we get into a situation where she a) doesn't have full control and b) feels like she would need to share her deep/true feelings to truly have a discussion. The conversation then turns to her berating me for things like ""being a robot"" and not caring about her/our family/anyone except myself.

So, ultimately I'm looking for any thoughts/ideas/articles that I can take in in order to better prepare myself to start the conversation when I recognize situations that could cause her anxiety to spike. I've recognized that trying to fix things/offer advice is the wrong move and I currently take the active listening approach to hear what she's saying and try to identify key things to dig into further but that's where the conversation typically goes negative.

Edit: Just giving an example from today. After typing this up I went in our room where she was in bed with a coffee and started a conversation saying that I recognize that the situation with our daughter is stressful given the things that are happening with her at school/places where we can't be there to see what's happening and get all the information and have to rely on her/3rd parties to tell us what's going on. Additionally I said that I am learning a lot about everything our daughter goes through in social interactions and seeing the parallels to my SO and I appreciated hearing my SO's thoughts on how our daughter can approach those situations/what's worked well for her and ultimately that I'm using what I'm learning to hopefully help my SO in the future in those same situations. The conversation went very negative after that with similar comments about me not really caring and only asking for myself, saying that I'm a liar and saying that I care doesn't mean anything and so on. I made the mistake of saying ""what can I do to show you that I care"" which she jumped on right away. Additionally she talked a lot about having to go through all of this alone since I don't know how to fix things (which I completely agreed with, I don't know and am not trying to fix things) and only make things worse. I told her that I am not walking away from things with our daughter or her, I know I've handled things poorly in the past and also don't have the same level of understanding of what our daughter is going through that she has but I will continue to be there for both of them and learn from what I'm hearing my SO talk through with my daughter. She made it clear that she feels like I am ""draining her energy"" and she needed to be alone to recharge so we left things at that..."
Anxiety,how did you tell your mom/parents you vave anxiety and need help?,I can't take it anymore. i am unemployed and i need a job but its not going to be possible for me. social anxiety is so bad for me. panic anxiety and more i think. depressed aswell. cant even talk to anyone. cant go to birthday parties because soon as i am the top and everyone looks at me i fucking shit myself. i go red i start panicing and my face is shaking and shit. so fucking scary. i just want it to be over and i want my mom to know but i am to scared to tell her and i feel ashamed.
Anxiety,"Taking Propranolol for the first time today, I have some questions.","Hi all! I get really bad physical anxiety off and on throughout the day (sweating, dizzy, fast heart rate, nausea, etc). My doctor prescribed 60mg of extended release propranolol. My resting heart rate is generally 80-100bpm. Blood pressure is normal. I’m excited to take it and see if it helps with my physical anxiety since that’s the only thing that limits me from going about my day normally. But I’m nervous because it could lower my blood pressure, but my blood pressure is always normal so I’m nervous it will lower and make me dizzy or pass out. Any advice is appreciated!"
Anxiety,anxiety is particularly bad at night :(,Does anyone have really bad anxiety only at night? but can function normally in the day? Like I get so much anxiety just trying to initiating sleep or knowing it’s bedtime. And advice on whether xanax would be good for sleep? 🥹
Anxiety,Pretty Sure My Anxiety Was Too Much For Him,"I've been dating this guy for about 7 months and he's great. My anxiety heavily revolves around things out of my control and being cheated on is probably the biggest worst thing ever. I think about it constantly, imagine scenarios with no rationality, and I know that makes me a bad partner. I was upset yesterday as usual I just try to keep my mouth shut because I don't want to burden anyone (I've literally lost friends because I bottle up and stop socializing so I don't bother them repeatedly with this ferris wheel of insecurity) but my therapist told me it's healthy to tell your partner how you feel even if it feels like too much because for the right person it won't be... and I think it was. He hasn't responded and yeah I know classic text anxiety, but.... things were going well and we had even played around with the idea of living together and now I feel I ruined a good thing because I can't be normal. There's no legitimate reason for me to constantly worry but he isn't super reassuring (I'm also not constantly forthcoming because #burdenonothers) so .... I suck at this and feel really sad I said anything at all. How do people open up about negative thought processes/functions and find someone who accepts that? Do I need to just... stfu? Should I come with a warning sign? I told him he's not responsible for my anxieties and insecurities but they exist and while I'm working to get better I'm still knee deep in these shitty feels. I don't even know anymore....

Tldr: Finally told bf the true depth of my anxieties and he didn't respond so I'm sure it's over and I feel like I fucked up by being honest."
Anxiety,am i allowed to post,[deleted]
Anxiety,Dissociation after upping Lexapro dose?,"Hi! My psych just upped my lexapro dose from 10mg to 20mg (less than a week ago). I do feel a change in my general anxiety, which is awesome, but I notice that after taking it in the morning, I tend to get really tired and this dissociated feeling. It goes away after an hour or two, but it’s super weird. I have trouble concentrating, putting together thoughts, being active in a conversation, and even sometimes my balance (which makes me think I’m also experiencing some minor anxiety attack). I am
going through a lot- out of work for going on 3+ months now due to an ACL tear I got at work, unable to move the way I usually do / would want to post-surgery but I’m working on it, so the anxiety makes sense a bit. Just wanna make sure that I’m not experiencing something super dire. Has anyone else had this experience? 

TLDR; Psych upped my lexapro dose from 10 to 20mg. I’m experiencing dissociation and anxiety for an hour after taking the dose. Does this happen to anyone else?"
Anxiety,Chest discomfort? I’m 15,"Hi, today after gym (I was playing basketball) I ate and drank a coke that had caffeine. About a hour later after I sat down my heart started racing and the left side of my chest had a squeezing/tightness feeling. Still does and I’m worried. What can cause this? Is this just anxiety or should I worry. Anyone else had anything similar? I’m very worried 15M"
Anxiety,I Don't Know What To Do,"Alongside anxiety, I have avoidant personality disorder. I have been skipping classes and have to force myself to go to work. When I'm out in public, I feel like I have a mask on. I'm not really myself. I tell people what I think they want to hear even if it harms me. 

I feel hopeless at this point, and have looked at career paths where I could work from home. 

I hate that these disorders are impacting my life so severely, but I'm not sure what I can do at this point. I tried residential psych treatment, partial hospitalization programs, cbt, dbt, and meds. I have an ESA, but she can't go out with me as she isn't a service animal. And I don't need a service animal.

I just want my life to be normal, but it feels like any dream at a normal life is lost and long gone.

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? I am open to everything."
Anxiety,made it to the job interview,"I came there unprepared not expecting anything, i thought if i dont think at all i will not get anxious. But mind you i get there. And the recruiter starts roleplaying with me and expecting me to speak in English to test me( English is not my first language) and i never worked as call center before. and omg the stuttering, stumbling over my words, my hands were shaking and i was getting all sweaty. 
The interview ended with her telling me to call her if im interested to proceed any further with this job

Guys idk if my anxiety could handle that but i will try to force my self into it. I literally feel nauseous right now."
Anxiety,my dad is making me so insecure about myself,"my dad made such a shitty comment and i don’t know what to do with it. he was taking a picture of me with boxing gloves because a friend of his is a boxing instructor and he said “close your jacket a bit” so i did. and he followed up with “so you can’t see your belly” 
this might seem like no big deal to some people but he used to body shame me all the time when i was growing up so my heart just shattered (I’m 22 now) and i feel so hurt and disgusted with myself now because i’ve been struggling for so long with loving myself and accepting myself. 

i didn’t say anything to the comment because i was so caught off guard and he was taking a picture so i didn’t wanna do anything weird on camera. i really didn’t know how to react. he’s always commented on food i eat or my weight and body for as long as i can remember and i just don’t know how to deal with it anymore. it has given me so much anxiety about anything i eat or anything i wear"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get really freaked out over anxiety fatigue?,"Its really freaks me out, mainly cause i have health anxiety, i always assume the worst.

Whereas if i think more rationally and consider the fact Ive been exercising like crazy the past few weeks, been sleeping awfully all on top of constant exhausting anxiety, no wonder my body feels tired, and worrying more about fatigue is only gonna make that fatigue worse!"
Anxiety,I’m worried I might be self harming due to my anxiety and never realized until now. (TRIGGER WARNING),"
TRIGGER WARNING PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT IGNORE THIS// going into detail about the things I do to myself so please don’t read any further if you aren’t comfortable with reading that!!!&lt;3  (nothing gory or bloody or anything like that. just kind of weird stuff i do to myself. I do mention a possible eating disorder so again, if you aren’t comfortable reading that i completely understand. please click off.)
  
So I’m 18, F. I’ve had a lot of things happen to me from ages 1-10 that I’m not comfortable sharing on here. I know most people see self harm as cutting, burning, etc, so that’s why I’ve never realized that this could be self harm until recently. And I’m worried.  
  
Whenever I feel like I don’t have control over something, or just anxiety in general, I have a few things I do to myself that I just saw as a coping mechanism, like the only thing I really can control. It’s pretty specific and weird so that’s why I’m unsure if it’s really self harm or if I’m just being dramatic. Since I was little I’ve either:  
  
1. Ripped out my own eyelashes in hopes that people would not find me attractive and leave me alone. Only now I just do it for the pain. I wear dramatic makeup every single day to hide it but that doesn’t mean I’ve ever stopped. I still do this. I’ve been doing this for as long as I can remember. (Probably started around age 5.)
  
2. I somehow learned how to give myself hangnails. I give myself hangnails only so I can rip them out and feel the pain afterwards. I get happy when I get hangnails because that’s just another way I can hurt myself. I see the tiny bits of blood, I feel the pain when I press down on my fingers for a few days afterwards and for some reason it’s almost comforting to me. My nails are severely damaged from this. I still do this every single day. I’ve been doing this since I was about 12.
  
3. I starve myself for a few days just to feel the emptiness and pain in my stomach. I still do this, but not nearly as much as I used to. I’ve been doing this since I was 14.
  
4. I punch my bed frame just to bruise my hand afterwards. I like seeing the bruises and feeling the pain for a few days afterwards. I don’t do this anymore. I did this from ages 7-12.
  
5. Whenever I get a random itch on my body, I don’t just do a normal scratch there to get rid of it. I literally scratch that spot for a few minutes and basically carve my own skin. Afterwards it’s super sore and causes weird marks all over my body. My family thought I was on drugs because of this lol, but I guarantee you it’s not that and it’s really just because I feel like I deserve feeling that pain and its a pain I have full control over. I still do this. (I actually just got finished doing this which is what made me think to post this.)  
  
I know all of these are super weird and that’s why I can’t tell if I’m just fucking crazy or if I actually need serious help and I’m hurting myself. You can judge me all you want. Everybody else already has and it seriously doesn’t hurt me anymore. I just don’t know if these are normal things everyone does or if I seriously need help. I’ve spent a majority of my life in therapy and I’ve been diagnosed with SEVERE anxiety, depression, and mild PTSD which I did EMDR therapy for a while which seemed to help a bit. But I’ve never told therapists about these things I do to myself because of the weird looks I get from it. They genuinely make me feel crazy and like nobody is willing to help. I know it’s a therapists job to help me but I still feel like I’m going to be judged by them regardless. I haven’t been to therapy in about a year (My therapist just left her office without telling me or my family.) This has happened so many times and I’m tired of constantly telling new people all of the stuff I’ve gone through and continue to go through just for them to leave me without saying a word.  
  
!!! I’m not sure if I should tag this as NSFW considering I’m talking about what probably is self harm. I put a trigger warning just in case, but if I should tag it please let me know and I will !!!"
Anxiety,Anxious about flying,So I’m diagnosed GAD and every time as a vacation approaches the thought of flying just terrifies me I am getting ready to fly to Florida from Ohio and I am so nervous it’s all I’m thinking about
Anxiety,Is it common to be completely depressed at the age of 24?,"Long story short, I was really enjoying my life in 2019 when I was a junior in college and, for the first time in my life, life wasn’t a drag where I “had to do things” to “get through them” was dating for the first time in my life, had friends, classes, and of course then happened a once in a century pandemic that confined me to a room for 2 years straight doing stressful college exams and etc, utterly destroying my social life.

Fast forward to 2022. I suffered through 2 years of remote college, having zero social interaction. Depressed and with a totally destroyed life, I spent 3 months looking for a job. Got a new job not too long ago as basically a telemarketer making 40K. Job and training sucks beyond belief. I have zero social circle, no friends, not dating anymore. 24 male and never been in a relationship. Life completely destroyed. To top it off, the 2 years of solitary confinement from 2020-2021 gave me what I can only describe as insomnia. Even if I fall asleep at 11 PM, I wake up at 2 AM like clockwork, then I usually fall back asleep but am tired for the next 20 hours which makes work suck even more. 

Does life get better from this point or should I just get rid of all delusions of hope?"
Anxiety,"having a breakdown making breakfast here, fuck wtf is going on?",I'm crying omg wtf I'm crying.... Holy shit I don't think I've felt like this since I was 8. Wow woah. Fuck
Anxiety,CONSTANT ANXIETY,"
I was wondering if it’s just a “me” thing or if other people go through the same reality I do.
My head constantly worries, about absolutely EVERYTHING. Whether it’s a TikTok guilt-tripping video that triggers this or even forgetting to say good night to my little sister. I immediately start thinking the worse possible outcome of my situation which leads me to being distressed for the rest of the day/night because the thoughts will not leave me alone. “What if she thinks I don’t love her anymore” “What if I didn’t save all those sounds in my draft, will I lose my soulmate”. 

Every single day. I feel like my mind is going a thousand miles per hour thinking about everything that could go wrong throughout the day or my mind gives an incredible amount of space to things that stress me like my college grades as well as the way I didn’t say bye to my dog before leaving. I will go the entire day thinking about it and dreading myself for it. I haven’t been able to go one day without being anxious. 

What can I do to ease this state of mind?"
Anxiety,physical symptoms of anxiety,"I 've been an anxious person my whole life, but the last few years my anxiety has become almost unbearable. Panic attacks, ridicoulus social anxiety, and just sweating and anxiety through most of the day. 

What recently bothers me the most is horrible physical anxiety symptoms when Im in social situations. My head would start to shake when I look at someone and I would also start to feel very dizzy, like Im about to fall down.

I would really like to solve this without a therapist.  Can someone please point me in the right direction? What the hell is going on?"

Anxiety,Grunting/breathing using throat muscles when breathing,Anyone else experience this? I've been having heavy breathing due to anxiety for the past week and this is kinda freaking me out. Its not conscious at all
Anxiety,If anyone here deals with anxiety on the regs to the point you stop eating umm how do you fix that? (Also have adhd),"The last week or so I’ve been eating less and less like maybe 1-2 meals I’d head of like 2-3 good meals and some snacks in between. 

I feel so anxious about cooking and eating and I am struggling to break out of it. This happens when I run out of money. I did get some funds to get groceries but even then I feel stuck with cooking a good meal and I’m getting by on crackers and cheese. 

I’m struggling to breathe sometimes too — like my breath just *pauses* And it feels like a weight is on my chest. 

I am safe. I have a place to stay, good to eat, water, clothes, family but I don’t know why I feel stuck in survival mode like this. 

I love food too so I don’t know why I’m like this."
Anxiety,Started shaking and entire body broke out in a sweat,"I spent 4 hours in some of the worst work conditions possible at my job. Finally the cherry on top happened and I think I snapped, and I believe that snap may have been an anxiety attack. 

The second that cherry dropped my entire body broke into an immediate sweat. I started shaking and stuttered simultaneously. I then told my customers I'd be right back since ""I had to fix something in the back really quick"". I went back there and spent a minute trying to just calm myself down so I wouldn't start crying. 

I'd never felt so horrible so quickly, is what I experienced what an anxiety attack is?"
Anxiety,I wish there was a subreddit to tell me how to do adult things like getting my tires fixed,But I more wish it was a detailed description of what I’m supposed to say and do. I don’t like to say or do anything unless I know exactly how to do it and I haven’t done next to anything in life because of it. I am about to move out on my own And I am terrified. Let’s be honest I’m moving on to a military base and I didn’t even finish 9th grade….
Anxiety,WTF is wrong with me,"At the beginning of January I had a dental procedure done to close a gap in my front teeth.  After a few days I started to hate it and became obsessed with how it felt and the fact that there was something “fake” on my teeth.  So I had it removed, but it doesn’t feel the same.  The pictures show that they are as close as possible and 99 percent the same, but it doesn’t matter.  I’m a second opinion on it by a different dentist because for some reason I think that will put my mind at ease, but  in reality I know it won’t.  

I know it’s irrational but I literally feel like I’ll never be the same person again.  I think it feels weird when I talk but everyone says I sound fine.  I’ve had ridiculous anxiety and some OCD all my life but for some reason this small incident has sent me into a tailspin of anxiety attacks almost daily.  I can still function but everyday I wake up sick to my stomach and with a lump in my throat.  This is embarrassing because I know im overreacting but I cannot help it."
Anxiety,I’ve thought about everything before anyone else has and it leaves me bored with suicidal thoughts,I can think of everything positive that someone will say to me before they say it and it just makes me want to end it all. In my head I’m playing out scenarios of me ending it.
Anxiety,What can I do to keep my mind off it?,"So about a year ago I got surgery on my acl and recently Ive been feeling great physically but mentally I have these negative thoughts about it like injuring myself again and not being able to play and im worried it would manifest it self. I try to keep my mind off it by watching a Youtube Video, Playing A game, exercising etc. But I just keep reminding myself about it."
Anxiety,Does anyone else get really bad morning sickness from anxiety?,I always get really hot and shivery in the mornings and sometimes I’m sick and can’t make it to school. I take the bus to school and I’ve only ever been sick in school but just when I arrive there. The nhs specialist person I spoke to said it’s definitely a problem and something that should be looked into more and hopefully they will find a way to combat it. I just wandered if anyone else gets the same issues and no I’m not pregnant. I don’t have any underlying health conditions

Anxiety,One mistake ruined everything,"2 weeks until now, my self confidence and motivation burnt out. First, I lost my money in stock investment. It was alright from the start but after my boss gave me a hectic job for 1 week, it started to stress me out. Now one of the client was very frustrated and disappointed because I did mistake on backing her files up. One mistake and it shattered me. Maybe the stress was filing up. I can still back it up again. But it really shattered me. I literally cried because of the stress was too much. I don't have anyone to lean on. I mean I have friends and family but I can't let them feel down just I because I shared my depress feelings and thoughts. One night, I was sitting at the chair of my desk in office, it was already 7pm. My usual out is 5pm. I was sitting and staring into emptiness for 2 hours... 'I want to end this but how'. I found a scissor on top of the other desk. I grabbed it slowly and point it at my wrist... I didn't have the courage to do it. I still want to live my life... But my mind was telling me that 'it is the only way out'. I know I won't do that suicide thought, I know it. But my mind's telling me that is the only option. I hope I bounce back from this storm of my life. Thanks for my friends and family."
Anxiety,please help.,"i officially started my podcast a couple of days ago and my anxiety has been through the roof. ive struggled with anxiety my entire life and avoided situations that will aggravate it. this is the first time in my life (M26) that i’m actually fighting back with my anxiety. idk if i should be proud or worried because my anxiety trips has been waking me up in the middle of the night. 

I was literally shaking during the first episode. im not sure if it’s because of me just thinking it’s the awful anxiety from my childhood thats coming to hunt me or just regular anxiety from starting a new venture. i smoked before the pod and was still nervous. but i still got it done which i am proud of. 

whenever i feel bad anxiety, the physical reaction for me is vomiting. thats what im more afraid of.

Anxiety,Major anxiety attack free for about 3 months,"Aside from my last post 2 months ago where I got anxious due to a scare, I've been 3 almost 4 months free of really bad anxiety attacks where I get sudden thoughts of impending doom, or just general social anxiety issues.   


My only difference that I've done was start taking vitamin supplements and paying attention to what I might be deficient in. It started out with Vitamin D and I also added Vitamin C supplements as well. It's no cure, as I still do get anxious, but no attacks, and I'm linking it to that. Since starting supplements, I've also just generally feel better (minus the depression I still face, but physically/mostly mentally).  


I know this might sound stupid and obvious, but I genuinely think that being deficient was one of my root causes."

Anxiety,im terrified of anything i eat or drink being drugged.,"im gonna add a trigger warning just incase. i talk about trauma, paranoia/anxiety/ocd.


so ive been dealing with something for about a year now, after i had a bad experience with my first (and l a s t) edible when i was 16. it was such a horrible experience, i did used to smoke weed and decided to take my first edible on new years with my old bestfriend. i thought i would be fine, but i practically ate the whole cookie while she only took a couple bites. i know its my fault entirely because it was my decision, but she didn't know how much was in it and didn't really warn me about how much i should eat. 

a while after the experience, everything was okay until i started having ""trauma dreams"" about tripping the fuck out and not being able to do anything about it, or accidentally eating something with weed or even drinking alcohol and absolutely freaking out. or taking something and being later told that its an edible and trying to make myself puke it up and waiting in fear for it to hit me.

and now, for almost a year, i check every single thing before i eat or drink it to make sure there's no ""thc"" in it. i read the ingredients carefully and examine the container, package, or bottle and i usually check it more than once incase ive missed something. if i forget and don't check it while im already eating, i start to get anxiety and i go back and check to make sure. that actually happened to me just now with the hot cocoa i made thats never been opened. 

some of the thoughts that go through my head are ""what if my parents accidentally left this out and no one was supposed to eat it because it has weed in it"" or ""what if they accidentally bought something with weed in it"" and so even when everyone's asleep, i absolutely have to wake up my mom and ask if something is okay to eat or drink because im scared it would have something in it. 

one of the reasons i hate going over to other people's houses is because im afraid to eat certain things. i have a rule in my head to not eat at anyone's house if they smoke weed or have anything to do with it because i could ingest something. at my cousins house, i grabbed a jar of pickles from the fridge and i was checking everything like usual but i still had to ask if it was okay to eat. 

its just food honestly, even touch gives me anxiety. my step dad used to smoke weed and he has his stuff in the garage and i was looking through his tools one day for tape and my mind immediately said ""wash your hands, now. do not touch your face, there could be weed wax on his tools and you just touched them"" and i booked it and washed my hands pretty hard. its even happened with tree sap. even with normal things, I worry that it could make me trip out if it gets in my mouth. it happens with flowers and plants and random substances on the counter or in a drawer. i always look up if certain things like that can mess you up. im terrified of nutmeg and i will not touch it or even smell it. i will not eat anything with nutmeg in it. my new deodorant has hemp seed oil in it and i was scared to use it at first. i know it wouldn't affect me though. 

after i eat, sometimes i sit there panicking, waiting for the ""drugs"" to kick in, and it never happens of course. 

this one time at my cousins house, the same cousin from before, it was thanksgiving in 2021 and their neighbor made a dish for us and i refused to eat it because 1, he makes me uncomfy and 2, i was afraid he laced it. he kept trying to get me to try it and it just made the thoughts worse, i kept thinking he WANTED me to get drugged or he got some weird sexual thing from it. i get thoughts like that a lot too :( 

i will not take anything from strangers or people we haven't seen in a while, i even hate the idea of trick or treating now, even though im 18 now. its hard to believe  younger me ate candy from completely random fucking strangers ya know? 

last year, it got to the point where my cousin had to be there with me and eat the same thing with me to assure me that it was okay, and id force myself to eat while thinking about the possibility of tripping out later and i would cry because i hated dealing with this and i hated the anxiety and i just wanted to eat normally. 

it doesn't matter if the package is sealed or not, my mind still thinks of a way that it could get drugged. like whoever made it or someone in the company or factory or whatever could've put something in it before sending it off. i also squeeze bags too, to make sure no air comes out. i feel stuck and unsafe :( i don't even wanna drink alcohol. im scared to take certain medications. i do take medication for my mental health and i really need new ones and a part of me is a lil nervous that the pills will make me feel ""high"" in a way. i had a procedure back in january and i was panicking because i had to be sedated and i was scared it would make me feel high, i did research and everything and asked friends but it didn't help. does anyone understand what im feeling?"
Anxiety,Anxiety when weekend is coming to an end.,"My anxiety is the worst on a Sunday evening. The reason for that is I am scared thinking about the task, emails &amp; chats awaiting for me on Monday. It gets worse when it is night and sometimes I will lose sleep over it. 
Sunday is the day where I am supposed to rest because it is my off day but my body and mind can't relax at all. Especially my brain, it's so noisy that I feel overwhelmed. Sometimes I feel helpless. I really dont know what to do 😞"
Anxiety,"Can't take this anymore. I feel like I'm a pervert, if this did happen.","So i have OCD. 21F. I was at this party a few months ago. I had just started my medication after having a very bad time. My crush was there too. It was a pool party so he was showing in the bathroom in the bedroom. I am not sure if this event happened as i have false memories, however i remember going to the bedroom at one point and not telling him i was there hoping that my crush comes out naked (i mean with underwear) after showering and feels awkward after seeing me there.

Anxiety,I’m just numb and exhausted,"I (18M) think I started to become obsessed with my mental health and anxiety/depression in about September. Ever since then it’s been almost all I think about and everything I do is to try to make myself “happy” and “normal”

It’s all my brain thinks about nonstop and all I do every day is nitpick and doubt about how I’m feeling. It’s gotten to the point where I’m just numb and all I feel now is sadness and anger. There are moments where I know I should feel happy but it’s like my brain blocks the emotion out

I’m so tired of being like this and I don’t even know if this is the problem but I literally don’t think or feel anything anymore and it’s so exhausting and I’m just done"
Anxiety,"What does it mean when your thoughts won't turn off and you are concerned and bothered by many many things, but you don't FEEL ""anxious""?","Like, I can't sleep and I want my brain to shut up. And all day I keep worrying about a billion different things. But I don't feel those typical anxiety things like racing heart or nervousness... I just feel ........... uptight? Tense?

I don't know, I guess there are different types of anxiety."
Anxiety,Public Speaking Anxiety,"To start I am a 19 year old male, who has had anxiety my entire life receiving a formal diagnosis when I was 15. Over the years I have learned to live with my general anxiety with only specific situations causing an increased response. A lot of this situational anxiety I have been able to overcome through repeated exposure such as my fear of amusement park rides, which I no longer have any issues with. 

Now onto the issue at hand, I have always had an irrational fear of public speaking which has gotten significantly better over the years again due to repeated exposure although I have seemed to hit a “plateau”. Interestingly over the years I discovered that this anxiety would only present itself when presenting to my peers or other people around my age. Anytime I present to those younger/older than me I have no issues whatsoever. 

I have also noticed that this anxiety does not seem to manifest itself consciously. Essentially, even though I tell myself that I am prepared, my presentation is good, others are in the same position as me, I am acting irrationally etc a response is still elicited. 

My theory is that my mind is subconsciously acting based off of a sort of association-based response stemming from social interactions during my childhood. 

As I am in university this has started to affect my performance with common symptoms being restlessness, profuse sweating, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and short term memory loss. This results in a detrimental effect that cannot be combated by methods such as preparing more, as no matter how prepared I am my thoughts turn into a disorganized mess. 

Treatments appear to consist of CBT, SSRI’s, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers. 

I will admit I’m against taking SSRI’s as my anxiety only becomes  debilitating in certain situations as well as their side effects and long term effects. 

I also am somewhat against taking benzodiazepines due to their tendency to cause short term memory loss and their reported awful withdrawal although I would consider them if the benefit outweighed the risk.

CBT seems to have very mixed reviews but I guess couldn’t hurt to try.

Beta-blockers such as propranolol appear to have great efficacy for performance based anxiety so this seems to be the best option.

I would love to avoid exploring these avenues but it has gotten to a point where my performance in school is being hindered. 

Does anyone else suffer with something similar and if so what methods/medications have you found effective.
Any advice is welcomed. 

On a final note I have never been prescribed any medications for mental health issues and occasionally drink, vape, and smoke weed. I also do not consume Caffeine."
Anxiety,High + tired going to bed,"Felt some anxiety but breathed through it after I realized I was anxious??
I thought I had felt a tingling in my head and a few months ago I like hit a bag of ice on my head swinging it over and the doc said I should be fine... and go to the ER if I ever have a tingling in my neck or head *but* he said he doubts they would happen.


Well earlier I like bumped my head not even hard with my headphones on like leaking forward but that was hours ago but like 30 minutes ago I thought I felt a tingling almost but it could be me just needing rest cuz I didn’t get much sleep also it’s late now....

Was worries about being injured or whatever and worried is die? Weed paranoia? 😕😕


I know I sound silly right? Sorry"
Anxiety,So i think that i am beyond help now. Now i just don't know what to do. TW.,"21F. No su!cidal stuff but i think I'm beyond saving. I think my previous even was not even OCD. I think i am actually a pervert and that i made a huge terrible mistake and i cannot be forgiven. I just don't know how to accept it. My chest feels heavy at the thought that i will need to carry this burden for the rest of my life. i don't deserve love or affection considering how bad i messed up. Feel like putting this up on social media too. Basically if yoh don't know what I'm refering to:

Don't help. If this happened, I'm a pervert and i might need to go to prison or something. I really feel like it did happen hence i don't know what to do. Guilt is a horrible emotion. Really."
Anxiety,advice needed!,i’ve noticed when i’m drunk i’m more in tune with my feelings I can actually feel. obviously I don’t want to depend on alcohol to feel my emotions; but it’s something i’ve observed. i’m also more motivated when drunk? i’m unsure what this is or if it has to do with prozac. but any Insight is helpful!!(:
Anxiety,Breathing,Hey guys I’ve been struggling a lot with anxiety lately and it’s come to the point where I constantly am feeling like a suffocating.

I’ve been try to find multiple ways on how to fix this issue but I would like to hear from someone who has over come this or has any tips on how to manage it.
Anxiety,"Most people don't like being with an introverted anxiety person, does this normal?","It's so hard to find that most people around being hate to be with you cuz of your anxiety disorder.

It's only hard because when you realize that people who you gave them everything, don't deserve..

Anxiety,Worried about germs,"So I cooked some dippy eggs this morning - but when I went to put one of them in the water I realised it was cracked - idk when this happened. I thought maybe I might be able to salvage it so I put it in the water anyway, but as you could expect all the egg white started leaking out. I already had another egg in that same water so I continued to soft boil that and then eat it. My question is, am
I at risk of the germs from that cracked egg getting into contact with the uncracked egg surface? And then me eating it?? Or would the boiling water have killed any bacteria from the cracked egg?"
Anxiety,Infection Anxiety,"Does anyone else suffer from anxiety about having been infected with Covid, after attending a social event or being on public transport?

I wear a mask, and I am vaxxed and boosted, but I still get very upset and nervous that I've caught Covid every time I've been exposed to people I don't know for any length of time.

I had Covid right at the beginning (wasn't hospitalised), and I have a mild version of Long Covid, and that worsened my asthma permanently.

I became quite mentally fragile during the first year or so of the pandemic, so I'm trying to reintegrate into the world, but this infection anxiety is absolutely overwhelming me.

I'm not very sure how to handle it, as there's no assurances I won't get it, but I feel like sometimes my reaction is overblown."
Anxiety,"Overwhelming emotions (catharsis?) AFTER finding successful treatment? Has anyone else experienced this? Did it get easier to feel ""normal""?","Hi all,

(Very brief tl;dr at the end for those who don't wish to read it all)

I did a really basic search with most of the key words in the title and I didn't really find anything similar to this. I also don't possess the wherewithal to look that hard.

Anyway, I recently had what I can only describe as a nervous breakdown. Like the whole façade I had built over my entire life just collapsed from both internal and external factors and caused an onslaught of mental, emotional, and physical symptoms at once. It lasted for about two weeks with varying degrees of intensity. It was terrifying, but I also think it was really important. I have been diagnosed with so many different things over the course of my life as the result of so many problems of my own invention. The real *problem* though, is that I have been constantly worried my entire life. When that aforementioned façade collapsed, I felt completely lost. 

I was able to get in to see my psychiatrist unusually quickly because of a cancellation. I just told him, flat out, ""I have anxiety (it's understandable he missed it because I only ever seek treatment when I give up), I don't want SSRIs (took for several kinds for several years and none had any effect), and I don't want benzos (personal feelings about this type of drug)."" Then I just simply asked for help. We had a long conversation which outlined a number of adjunctive and complementary treatment options beyond simply the pharmacological ones.

It has been two weeks and last Friday was the first day in as long as I can remember that I was not worried. It took that day to help me truly understand that every day up until that one, I had spent worried. The moment I realized that, I collapsed on my floor bawling and I just really let it all out. It felt so good, but so intense; so joyful for the process of healing and improving to begin, while simultaneously grieving how much time has been wasted always worrying. 

What's happening now, although they have not been as intense as the first one, it seems like every day or night there is a wave of overwhelming emotion and I just let it out--happy and sad at the same time. I have always been an emotional person, so the thought that I somehow have repressed emotions is mind-boggling. I just can't think of how else to describe it. Like I'm still the same me that I have always been, but now it feels like a dam has been broken that blocked certain feelings, expressions, or emotional depth from my conscious mind.

I feel like I am experiencing life normally, it's exciting and I know I'm improving, but it's also overwhelming and scary. Like it would have been easier to just remain an anxious wreck, but I would have literally ripped myself apart if I didn't seek help.

So I just want to ask if anyone else has experienced anything like this? Like happy anxiety (is this catharsis?) from feeling like whatever treatment you have found to work for you? Does this get less overwhelming? Did you find anything helpful in making the change sustainable after the honeymoon phase with feeling ""normal"" ended? The little internal dialogue in my head also wants me to ask if this feeling of normalcy is actually just me going completely crazy, but I'm not going to because my heart tells me that's not true.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. It has been a wild experience, living life, and I look forward to continuing until its natural end.

TL;DR: Had nervous breakdown. Realized I have anxiety. Finally advocated to my doctor that I have anxiety and need help. Help actually seems to be working. Help has created feeling of normalcy, normalcy has created overwhelming emotions that come each day. Normalcy is kind of scary. Can you relate? Are you scared of normal too?"
Anxiety,"How to deal with being extremely anxious, please??","School starts tomorrow and I feel really anxious. Last night I woke up like 3 times and my heart was racing so bad and today when i woke up my heart was racing even faster, my head hurts and I feel nauseous I can't do it anymore I swear I need to study but I can't. I am literally lying in my bed becauee I feel like passing out. How to stop feeling so anxious??"
Anxiety,Anxiety in PE,"(Sorry for my bad english) 

I am not good at sports, mainly bcs I don't like to sport in front of people so I barely practice and when I do, I never go all in bcs I'm afraid that I will look crazy or weird and people will laugh at me. So I never have good points for PE and everyone assumes I'm just really bad at sports even though I know I could be better but I never say or show that.
For PE we need to wear either wide shorts or girls can also wear sport pants that are really 'skinny' and I don't like to wear them bcs they make me feel fat but I do wear them bcs if I wear shorts everyone will see that I pick my skin and I have a lot of scars as a result.
There are these girls in my class that always laugh and judge people in pe not only me but also a lot of other people. Especially this one girl is always really judgy, I was in a team with her multiple times and everytime I messed up she would sigh and give me dirty looks and made me feel worse about every mistake I made wich made me play even worse. Luckily there were other people even of opposite teams that see this and try to encourage me. For example 2 weeks ago we had volleyball and I was with that one girl and 2 other friends in a group and she was bitchy to me in rhe evaluation like she had enough of me and after the evaluation it became worse, she was complaining the whole time how it sucked and sighing every time I couldn't catch a ball even though she didn't even throw it well to me. At this point I had enough so I turned my back on her didn't look at her anymore and didn't pass to her. Even though I still felt bad every time I missed. My friends were really supportive even when I missed, they gave me tips and said that I was getting better wich made me feel better. 

On a semi unrelated note: 
This week we had rope skipping and I'm really good at that but like always I didn't go all in bcs the girls were laughing on how stupid I and some other people looked (this happened the most during warm ups were we would be in line and I was last in line so I had the whole class watching me). After warm us we needed to learn a new trick every 4 min and I picked them all up really fast but every time I jumped I felt like an idiot so after one or two minutes I would stop and say that my asthma (which I have but not severe) was not so good lately and I was tired wich was true but I was able to do more. But in 2 weeks we are going to get evaluated and that gives me even more anxiety bcs we are going to need to do 40 counts (5 tricks for 8 counts) without hesitating or stopping wich is really hard for me to do bcs my anxiety make it so I can't breath bcs I always feel like there is a pressure on my lungs so I wouldn't be able to do more then like 3 tricks even though I can do them all I'm really scared and really don't wanna go to pe anymore.

I have had multiple anxiety attacks in pe and every time I go I feel more and more insecure I really don't know what to do anymore and really need some advice on how to deal with my anxiety for all of this basically 

Thank you for reading this"
Anxiety,How to deal when problems that you have no control over make you anxious? For example war,
Anxiety,I'm going to try and stop Catastrophizing!,"For months I've been Catastrophizing. I only learned about the term today. I thought I was just purely anxious before I learned about it. It's so re-assuring to know it's a real thing and I'm not going loopy.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost always to do with my girlfriend. I'm overprotective and jealous. It's probably rooted somewhere in my teenage years. There's a few things I can think of related to where it started. But she thinks the world of me and is always there for me. She's the woman I want to tackle life with. We're getting engaged in the summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

She always sees past my catastrophizing and loves me for me. She's unbelievably supportive. I'm not just doing this for me. I'm doing this for her. And our future family. From today, I'll try my absolute best rationalize my thoughts instead of jumping to the absolute worst case scenario. It's not going to be easy, but it's the least I can do. I'm so excited to learn and grow."
Anxiety,I think it's time I face the music,"I've been having anxiety and I think its finally reached a point where I should search for some sort of cure or at least something to help ease this. It's turning into panic attacks and preventing me from sleeping or even thinking straight once it hits bad. I just don't know what help I can get considering I can't think of what could be causing this :/ worst part is ive always been a solid/hard person and now that i'm hurting emotionally im worried there's not many I can talk to that are close to me without them looking at me differently.

I just want a distraction,  atleast till I can fall asleep and get through this one :(

Btw this is the furthest I have come with being open about this, I hope this leads me to something good"
Anxiety,Can i pause therapy?,"I've been on therapy for three months now and i was taking weekly sessions since.
I have social anxiety, generalised, and OCD with mild depression. I'm also using cipralex for one month now.

I feel like I'd like a break from therapy but i don't know for how long and I'm afraid that I'll need help during the exams but at the same time, i want to find the lost me and restore it.
I Don't feel like myself anymore...
I want to forget about the situations that stress me and what to say to my therapist or to even THINK.
Has anyone here paused therapy and how did it go? + any recommendations are welcomed"
Anxiety,I want to get better but not really,"Hi, i just want to ask if there's anyone who feels the same way as i do.

Anxiety,Overthinking Life,Does anyone else feel like when you have had a good day you’re anxiety can sometimes be worse then when you’ve had a bad day ? Sometimes at the end of a night and I’m alone with my thoughts I begin to overthink about nothing and send myself into a panic . was wondering if anyone else feels the same .
Anxiety,Physical symptoms,"Hey guys. I wanted to ask you what your physical symptoms are when you suffer with severe bouts of anxiety. Do you suffer tight chest, muscle pain, lymph node swelling and inflammation? I’m trying to figure out if these are all connected. I’ve never known anxiety to have this many physical side effects. 


The last week or so, mine has been so  severe to the point where I’ve had so much physical discomfort as well as uncontrollable panic attacks. I didn’t even know it was possible until I felt one today whilst talking on a live meeting. It’s like gasping for air and feeling everything tighten up, I just wonder if this is common. Thank you."
Anxiety,Current events,"Hi everyone first time here but I’m so anxious with everything that’s going on. I know everyone else is of course but I’m literally losing sleep over this and I’m a big ball of anxiety. I’m afraid it can go nuclear and it’s so sad that we are living through times like this. I cant take myself away from the news bc the thought of something turning worse sits on my mind. I read the news hoping for some hope but I feel like every time I read, it gets worse. I feel like I’m going insane and keep having anxiety attacks."
Anxiety,i think my mum gave me my anxiety,"all throughout my childhood and even now in my adult life my mum has done so many things that have messed up mine and my siblings mental health. and the other day she found out that my brother had been confiding in his girlfriend about her behaviour and she got really upset saying that her childhood was worse and that he has no right to be complain to his girlfriend about her being emotionally abusive..

there's been times in my childhood where she locked my dad out the house and me and my siblings were screaming and crying trying to fight her to open the door and let him in. there's been times she has attacked my dad in public (one time at a theme park she scratched my dad's back so bad that it left scars)..

another time she put me and my siblings in her car and chased after my dad in his car when she found out that the sport event he was attending also had a woman in attendance (she doesn't like my dad being around women or even listening to women on the radio). and she was on the phone to him while she was chasing him with us in the back of the car screaming at him down the phone that she was going to crash our car into his and i quote ""kill all of us""

another thing she's done probably about 5 or 6 times throughout the years is opened her door while driving at 60mph on the motorway and threatening to jump out and kill herself because she was having an argument with my dad. all I remember is me and my siblings crying and pleading in the back for her not to jump out.

and im pretty sure once or twice I've walked into the kitchen and my mum was holding a knife up while arguing with my dad.

now im 21 and still living with them and still these things continue. im saving up to get out this house and doing well in college to hopefully get a good paid job. but it's hard to keep studying and keep up motivation when theres always awful stuff happening in the house. literally as i was typing this a massive argument erupted between my mum and brother and they just finished screaming at eachother. last year my parents had a huge vicious argument between them and it sent me into a panic attack in front of them (i was in the same room at the time) and ive never had one before but i just instinctively curled up in the corner and sat there shaking for half an hour before I could calm down while my mum was stood there looking at me like i was crazy and telling me to stop being dramatic. then my dad came up later and told me to stop crying because we were about to visit my grandparents and he didn't want me to ruin it by showing up with puffy red eyes

im sure all of these things have added up over the years and made me extremely anxious. I can never get too close to people and i have little trust for anyone. I'm constantly worried that I've angered people and I chalk that up to constantly walking on eggshells my whole childhood so that my mum wouldn't start screaming at me. I could accidentally leave the cap off a tube of toothpaste and she would go red in the face and yell at the top of her lungs for about 20 minutes straight. I'm sure the neighbours hate us..

anyway i just wanted to post this because i have no friends or anyone to talk to about it with. i need to escape this house but i just can't afford it. I'm stuck here alone with absoloutely no friends and mountains of college work to do. idk sorry this was word vomit and I don't think I've coherently described my life and everything my mum has done - it's way too much to squeeze into 1 reddit post but it just angers me how my mum will do all these things and then switch to pretending to be a perfect mother who's never done a single thing wrong and that me and my siblings shouldn't be affected in the slightest by the emotional trauma she's given all of us"
Anxiety,GERD and heart palpitations,"Dear all, my partner lives with anxiety disorder and experiences heart palpitations during the night almost regularly.

Anxiety,Car buying when buying is a trigger,"When I was in college, before I met my now-wife, I often didn’t have enough money. I had days when I just didn’t eat. I was supposed to be covered, but wasn’t, but we won’t go into details of family politics here and now. Suffice it to say, I don’t like spending money.

Yesterday I went out and traded in our minivan for a used SUV. It was time, the van was getting long in the tooth and we needed something different. I was actually starting to dread driving the van. 

While I remained calm and smiling on the outside the entire time, it was rough doing that. Came home with the new car, took a klonapin, and laid down for a nap. 

But wait, there’s more coming up! Next I have to call up our insurance and get that changed! And I have to take in the old plate and register the new car! More spending, yay! 

But it was the good thing to do. And my very knowledgeable on the subject father in law tells me I negotiated a great deal on it."
Anxiety,Does anyone else experience this?,"I've always had bad anxiety, since I was young. Normally it's about what most people experience, but maybe a bit more intense. However it's still manageable and I can still function.

Sometimes however, I get HUGE waves of anxiety that last week's, making it impossible to function or enjoy anything. I find myself having panic attacks at random moments and the triggers aren't always consistent. These waves end up dying down eventually, but they are completely unbearable.

Does anyone else experience huge waves like this? If so, how do you deal with it? Why does this happen?

Anxiety,People are becoming tired,"Short background: In February 2020 suddenly my life changed. During physical education my heart went out of rithm and was very very fast. My PE teacher called an ambulance. I've done exams for heart, blood ecc...  All good. After this episode I developed severe panic attacks and two times I went to the hospital. One good teacher suggested me to see a psychologist, so I did just that. It's been 2 years and I'm still in therapy. I'm better now, but still I have some minor panic attacks and I don't go out. I also avoid every human interaction, like going outside. The problem is: at the beginning friends, teachers, family were very supportive. My friends left me alone, so I didn't strees myself to go out, my teachers gave me extra lesson for free and my parents supported my psychology sessions and supported also morally. Now, after 2 years, people are getting tired. Friends don't call me anymore, teachers started to be nervous and my parents say that I'm wasting my life. Basically now I'm alone fighting my own mind and I really don't have the strength to fight back. Srry for my English."

BIL is arrogant, shows off every chance he gets and makes constant digs at everyone when he’s around, when he leaves someone is always upset. He especially hates my husband as he feels threatened that he’s younger and more successful, I know he doesn’t like me and I don’t care. When he’s around the 2 of us he goes above and beyond to “one up” us. I avoid him as much as I can. Unfortunately, I could not avoid him yesterday.

He went shooting, came in with my SIL and while we were all talking, my husbands back faced to me so he didn’t see anything, he takes out his shot gun and cocks it infront of me. I jumped and he looks at me and says with a smirk “ohhh I love that sound” I ignore him and carry on my conversation. I look again and he has another gun in his hand, looking at it like he’s examining it and pointing it right at me. I may not shoot but I know you don’t point a gun at anyone. I thought nah, he can’t be doing it on purpose so I moved 3 times and he changed position and still aimed it at me everytime. I went straight next to my husband and he stopped. 

It was like I didn’t realize at the time what was happening until they left. I actually forgot about it for an hour, it was like I lost my memory it was crazy. It hit me hard when I remembered and told my husband. He is furious, he told me my BIL knows he’s not meant to take the guns out outside of the room etc. Sorry, I really don’t have the energy for the entire story.

From the second it hit me what had happened, I’ve been having major anxiety and a dissociative episode. I slept for 4 hours, my head hurts, I feel like I’m on the verge of collapsing and I can’t shake feeling dissociative. I feel completely out of body, everything around me feels like a movie. I do not want to feel like this, I’m mad at myself for letting someone like that make me feel like this. I want to feel like myself, anything I do to get myself back please?

I work from home so I’m alone when he comes around to pick up guns etc and I don’t feel safe."

Anxiety,"Anxiety relating to death/passing time hits me right as I try to sleep, or in the middle of the night. It’s getting worse. I have no idea how to control it.","Hi all. 

I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety but I’m starting to suspect I have it. In the past six months or so I’ve been experiencing something really upsetting when I’m lying in bed trying to sleep, or when I wake up in the middle of the night and am still sort of dozing. It just hits me that I’m going to die someday and that time is passing and it FREAKS me out. I obviously know I’m going to die. But this intrusive thought feels incredibly scary because it’s REAL (aka, yes I will die someday), and it comes on out of nowhere. It’s terrifying. It used to only happen every couple of weeks but now it’s practically daily whenever I try and sleep, and it’s starting to bleed into my day and making me constantly think about death and time passing. 

Nothing specific brought this on. I’ve also only just turned 27 years old, so it’s not like I’m old or hit a milestone birthday. I have no idea how to manage this but I feel like I can’t go on like this. It’s making me miserable and scared and detracting from my joy. 

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of anxiety specifically? If so, how do you manage / overcome it? Does anyone have any advice for me?"
Anxiety,Does anxiety makes you struggle with your partner?,"I've been dating her for almost 2 years since we broke up (we still talk) and the main reason we did is because of her anxiety 
She tells me she has feelings for me still, sometimes tells me she still wants me and saying she love me but later, a day after or something she ignores or she barely respond then saying she has hard time to decide if she loves me or not
Ever since our relationship began being really bad I started dealing with anxiety too, but for me it just makes me want her or be with her more then before 
She said I make her happy and she still care, then later saying she don't know if she want me in her life
So my question is, is there anyone here that deals with that too? When you don't know what you guys want with your partner?
I really don't know if it's actually her anxiety or just don't wanna talk to me at all"
Anxiety,I really needed to hear this and this might help - what is it that your anxiety wants from you,"So I subscribe to many therapy channels on youtube and today I was suggested this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96zzrgH_J34

The point that hit me hard was:

&gt; What does your anxiety want from you?

&gt; What does your anxiety want you to do?

&gt; What does your anxiety always end up doing?

If you sit and introspect just a little, not much, on these, you might be able to identify the thought patterns that start your specific anxiety and thought patterns that constitute your specific anxiety and finally, the patterns of temporary resolution. You might not get resolution at all (GAD, anxiety for weeks till one day you get up not being broken and so on)

When I did this exercise I saw:

**My anxiety is a big coward bully, that once scared, starts throwing a tanrum in my nervous system**, activating all my fear circuits and pushing up my heart beat, pumping out adrenaline, generally making my body and mind unliveable, in the hope that its fear goes away. It is adamantly convinced that  throwing a tantrum is the only way to solve a fear or problem or danger depsite the rest of mind knowing fully well that problems are always ever solved only by calm thinking, steadfast emotions and assertion rather than avoidance.

So, in my case, **anxiety takes the form of a bullying, adamant, stupid child unwilling to listen or change its behaviour, very egoistic and very dumb**

Also, it's like a part of me is anti-me, but not actually, because anxiety is functional, a pattern of behaviour, a collection of bad habits, not a fundamentally broken brain. 

I have OCD in which there is also self-sabotage by way of mischief (which was basically a coping mechanism to fight depression once upon a time) and there is also a persistent neurological ""pulsing"" or spiking of impulses that never ceases. Sometimes these impulses push the fear system, sometimes they push the limbic system (trembling, flinching), other times, provoke euphoria and excitement and still other times, sexual organs (unexpected unwanted body arousal when mind is preoccupied with some work or chore). 

While I have no solution yet for the neurological impulses apart from ignoring, controlling or shaking them off, I believe asking and remembering **What does my anxiety actually want me to do** makes me see the bigger picture and **pulls me out of anxiety's trap and cage** and I can see I am going to repeat the same stupid pattern again for the millionth time.

**This prevents the pattern from repeating because somehow the anxious mind gets wind of the fact the cycle is the same well known routine and there are no surprises, which means no danger**.

Hope this helps someone."
Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips regarding concentration?,"I get these weird intrusive images of places and just stuff almost all the time , it is really making it difficult to concentrate. It makes concentrating on anything really difficult, when i watching any media or using social media there are definitely not there which definitely helps by creating distraction , but I always end up wasting time , and then thinking i could have done something about it. It's only when i am unable to shut these intrusive images i keep scrolling on social media apps , is there any tips or suggestions to concentrate? 
Ps: ignore the grammatical errors please."
Anxiety,I don’t know what to do,"I don’t feel here. I feel like I’m dead or Im dying or somethings going to happen to me. I don’t know how to explain it but I just don’t feel here. I’m having such bad anxiety and I don’t know why, and when I try to think all I can think about it something bad happened and that I’m not really here. I think I’m going crazy and I don’t know what to do."
Anxiety,Ever since It has been suggested I might have anxiety I've been more pissed off. Yet I don't think that's a bad thing?,"18M molecular cell biology student in my first year of uni. Safe to say the last couple years have been something.

I've been burning the candle at both ends so ti soeaj for a while now. After coasting through my GCSE,s I kinda got sloppy in A levels and as a result had to work my ass off to catch up and make it to uni. Which I did.

Unfortunately no rest for the wicked. I worked a factory job in the summer to earn some cash and man was that job rough, unreliable work hours, exhausting etc etc. Then uni started. I had to move out which was terrifying at first. My work load feels insane and while I'm doing pretty good. I have been overworking myself in the process, failure is a massive fear that keeps me up and I think that's what I'm anxious about.

Oh and I have the shittest flat mate known to humanity who has been having like 5 people round every day messing up our kicthen and using it as a living space. He is also totally the one who keeps stealing everyone's food.

I was venting to my gf about this and she told me I might have anxiety, I've allways been one to sort of wave off anything to do with my mental health, but as soon as she said that I broke down sobbing. 

Well i took a break from work the next day and had a lay in. When I woke up I felt. Oddly confident?
I went into the kitchen and saw a can of rubricon that I had decided to save until the end of the year was gone.

I immediatly marched up to everyone's door and dragged them to the kicthen. I pointed out how everyone has proof they can't have stolen stuff, not being here when stuff went missing etc. And accused the shit mate to his face that either he was stealing stuff or it was his flat mates. He tried to spout some bs but I cut him off and told him to find out who it was and get then to pay back every single thing they own or I would report him to the reception and get them all thrown out.

After another day off I started working again oddly refreshed. 

I feel like I'm working an ammount I'm happy with and even if I haven't finished a piece of of I'm cutting myself off and having a break after 8ve worked form 9 to 5.

I don't know if I truly have anxiety. And I will still ask my doctor about it.

But for some reason now I'm no longer shying away from confrontation or wallowing in fear over if I'm working enough and deserve to be in uni.

I'm sort of angrily grabbing life by the horns I'd that makes sense?? 
Like ""this is my flat, I paid to be here. I have every right to throw tid flat mates friends out and I will do so whenever i want"" and
""I will work enough and I have done so. I'll pass these exams and I'm not going to spend 12 hours a day working to do so""

Idk this is a long rant.

I feel like the mere suggestion I have anxiety has changed me"
Anxiety,My brain won't stop overthinking.,"Please, I need help turning off my brain.

I keep overthinking the worst possible outcome in every situation. I want to tell someone about my thoughts but I feel like anxious thoughts are somewhat transferable or infectious. So I have mental debate with myself on whether to seek ho from a friend or family at the risk of probably triggering their own anxious thoughts. I eventually don't share, then my thoughts go out of control leaving me with no appetite and a lot self loathing. I don't what to do, because I feel like people will just say the same thing again 

""Stop overthinking, go to sleep"" I have trouble sleeping, I can't simply sleep because of my thought process, i have to exhaust myself. I hate everything about how I think. Why can't I just be normal like most people."
Anxiety,Is my nausea due to anxiety?,"So recently I’ve been battling really bad nausea and I’m starting to think it’s due to anxiety. My first week of starting a new school I felt really sick in the morning throughout that whole week but then on the last day of the week I made myself threw up and I felt better until about January. We had a two week Christmas break and when I came back for January I felt it again and it was really bad and it happened for about 2-3 weeks I think? I felt it whilst I was in class and it went away after I went home but it was still there for a bit. During that time it was mostly in sch n stuff and I sometimes felt it at night before the next day of sch. After that I didn’t feel it until about last week where I left the house and I felt sick as I left to go to a restaurant w my family but after a bit it started to go away . After that time I came home and it was still there in my stomach but wasn’t too bad as I was home. The day after that I felt it really bad as I went out and the day after that I felt it as well (that day was horrible almost unbearable) those two days I felt it before I left the house and after even when I came home. This week on Monday I felt it badly in the morning but it went away and then throughout the week I felt decent like I kinda felt i just battled thru it as it wasn’t that bad. However yesterday I went out to the library for 2 hours and didn’t feel a thing TILL I came home and I felt nausea for about an hour. 

That’s the story of when I feel nausea but I’ve started to realise that when I do have nausea, When I had the nausea I didn’t have any anxious thoughts so now I’m thinking it may be something else? I read some other threads about it and some ppl said it could be IBS or GERD. Now since I’ve had this nausea I’ve felt like a slight heartburn and this is one of the symptoms of GERD? So I’m really confused has anyone got any advice? I did call my doctor and she said it might be anxiety so I might be getting talking therapy. But because yesterday I felt the nausea AFTER I came home I’m wondering if it’s not anxiety? 

Thank you in advance :))"
Anxiety,Does anyone get anxiety about conflict?,Like I do with the people in my life being upset with me or with each other. I don’t know how to handle it.
Anxiety,How do I deal with anxiety?,"I'm constantly anxious and dreading anything involving school. Whenever I even *think* about it, I get really anxious and I feel like crying. On bad days, sometimes I really spiral into a dark pit. I keep thinking about the worst possible outcome about how I'll fail and how I'll end up unemployed and burdening my parents and so on. It's really really irritating and I find it difficult to do anything normally although I do manage it. 

How do I deal with it? How do I stop being so pessimistic about my life and future? My parents suggested that I distract myself or go out more. But it all just comes back to me once I think about school again and usually stronger than usual because I think about how I could've done stuff even though I have plenty of time to finish it. My grades suffer because I get so anxious about the deadlines that I rush because I feel like something terrible will happen if I don't and when I get a bad grade, I get even more anxious and depressed. It's really wearing me out and I've tried talking to my parents about it but I'm not very fond of speaking with my dad and I don't think my mom takes me seriously. What should I do?"
Anxiety,Weeklong breakdown,"After talking to this girl (20F), I (24M) met through Tinder and becoming friends with her for the past 5 months, she recently blocked me on every piece of social media we interacted with. And I know its only me that she is ignoring because her accounts still exist on the platforms we’ve been using. We talked day in and day out everyday and now she’s gone. I don’t usually post anything on reddit so I apologize if this is the wrong kind of thing to post here but It’s been a week and I’ve cried hysterically almost everyday. We weren’t even romantically involved but I had an appreciation for her that I’ve seldom had for alot of people. I don’t know why I’m posting this, maybe in the hopes that I might get some new advice thats different from I’ve been told thus far, but I’m feeling the lowest I ever have in my life."
Anxiety,How to help your partner deal with you,"My partner is great, but I do feel she struggles with my anxiety a lot of the time. Especially social anxiety. I don't want to have to get drunk all the time to come out my shell. But it's like the only way I don't feel completely uncomfortable in social situations. 

This seems to bug her a lot. Among other things. It's a big task for me to just go to the shop, nevermind socialise with a bunch of other people.

So, how do you guys help your partner, especially in situations like this? It's understandable for them to be frustrated. I just wish I could help her deal with me."

Anxiety,I wake up with my hurt beating loud and feeling like it’s in my throat sometimes I throw up.Is this anxiety ?,"As of recent I went through something very traumatic with an ex of mine but before that I still use to get random heart beating fast but ever since this happened I wake up with my heart beating fast and last Saturday I woke up heart beating fast and threw up then I just cried but I was so confused on what was going on.I felt very bad felt like my world had no colors it’s hard to describe but I felt horrible.since December I have random heart beating fast and I also space out a lot when I’m texting,driving and just not interested never used to happen.also when I get stuck in traffic I start crying really bad so I end up having to take the express lane so I don’t have to experience that .I can’t find a therapist that accepts my insurance because my other one is booked.Could this be stress or anxiety?"
Anxiety,A question about a physical reaction to anxiety,"Does anyone else experience mouth watering when they’re anxious? This is something really weird that’s been happening to me and it’s not accompanied by any anxiety nausea or anything (I read that nausea could cause mouth watering, but I haven’t had any.) It sometimes lasts for days and I really don’t know what to do about it or if anyone else has experienced this?"
Anxiety,I can’t cope anymore,"I feel like I’m going to get a heart attack any second now, my anxiety is at an all time high. I can’t cope at all anymore with everything that is going on in this world. I had problems with anxiety all my life now but this, this just feels different. It feels like the world could end any second now, nothing seems to be off the table anymore."
Anxiety,Is this considered sexual assult?,"I have never talked to anyone about this before, one of the reasons is because I don't want people to think I'm over reacting. This happened a long time ago, but it affected me. It was the last week of 7th grade. I had had a crush on this boy all year long and we had flirted and talked a bit. During free time, Joey asked me to be his girlfriend! I thought he was joking at first, but then I agreed. A few days later he comes over to my house for the first time. Things start out ok, we talk for a little bit, and he gives me a quick kiss. Very quickly things start to get uncomfortable for me. He wanted to play a game specifically intended to make me feel uncomfortable in a sexual way. I don't really want to play, but he starts by putting his hands between my thighs and slowing inching upward towards my panties. I tell him I'm uncomfortable and the game ends. The game ended but he was still making me uncomfortable. He put his face in my cleavage at one point. Towards the end of his visit, he asks me to sit on his face. I really didn't want to so I said no. He wouldn't take no for an answer. He kept begging and begging and I kept saying no. He told me ""you're my girlfriend, that's what you're supposed to do"" and I still said no. Eventually he overpowered me because I didn't know how to win that fight. Monday at school, i avoided him at all costs. I also didn't talk much to anyone else either. I ended up not talking to anyone from school for the whole summer, because I was so depressed and confused. I didn't understand what I was feeling at the time, I hadn't processed what had happened. I actually felt guilty for the way I reacted to what he did."
Anxiety,Cant sleep because I feel like i'll die in my sleep,"Ever since getting the rona and the vaccines my anxiety about health has kicked into high gear. I believe the rona and/or vaccine is inside my body eating my brain like swiss cheese, munching on my organs especially lungs and kidneys and causing damage. I've also convinced myself I have a tumor in my chest and that a blood clot will take me any second. Now I cant sleep because if I do pass I dont want them to find me like this, I look a mess and my room is a disaster. Also havent taken my anxiety meds for 7 days quite proud of myself BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS 😜"
Anxiety,Exam,"So I had this huge exam which I studied four months for. Did countless exercises, read 4 books and I’m so extremely scared of failing it to the point I simply can’t eat I can’t sleep and I keep shaking like a Chihuahua.

Anxiety,Fear of developing schizophrenia/psycosis,"Hello,

Ever since a really bad trip from were many years ago I have had huge anxiety and fear about developing some form of psychotic disorder.

I am naturally a very anxious person who has suffered from panic attacks and depersonalisation (which I am currently struggling with).

I obsess over the topic and I am constantly googling related questions. Has anyone else had these fears and obsessions around losing their mind?"
Anxiety,I don't think about it but still experience physical symptoms,"I have been dealing with anxiety for the past couple of months. it all started when I went to the gym after a good 20-day break and had about 2 cups of black coffee before my workout. Went to the gym warmed up, stretched, and straight away did 2 sets of heavy squats. Even after I was done with the sets I was feeling restless, so I sat down and started having palpitations something I had never experienced consciously. I was stressed out so went to the doctor and checked out my blood pressure which was also pretty high. The Dr prescribed me antacid and some GERD meds because I also had some food poisoning that past week. The next morning I suddenly woke up out of my sleep and started having palpitations. This stressed me out even more and went to the hospital right away and got all kinds of tests done. ECG, Echo, etc, and everything came out normal. A cardiologist prescribed me some anxiety meds (Inderal 10) for 15 days. Now the main reason I had this phobia is that my grandpa had heart attacks before his death and my uncle who was only 47 when he passed away also had heart failure and I used to link the smallest discomfort around my chest to my heart. I stopped traveling alone and used to feel symptoms if I was away from home or even a hospital.  It's been 2 months and I have improved a lot compared to the past months but I still experience some symptoms sometimes especially like - chest tightness, feeling ticklish around my chest and ribs area, tight neck and shoulders - even when I'm not thinking about it. What do I do to get rid of it completely?

Sorry for the long description."

Anxiety,Can’t type on keyboard cause it drives me nuts,I wanted to see if anyone has experienced a similar problem. I literally can’t type on my laptop keyboard for longer than 10 minutes at a time because the feeling of my Ulna bone (the arm bone that ends on the pinky side of your wrist) rubbing against the surface of my laptop makes me feel sick with anxiety. I get the same feeling when things rub against my left hip bone (which I get is oddly specific and makes no sense). It’s like my skin is crawling and makes me feel really tense/uncomfortable.

Anxiety,Will taking ativan let me study or will I just fall asleep?,I got prescribed ativan for anxiety. I was wondering if taking it would make me sleepy or just relaxed? I have an exam to study for but my anxiety isn’t letting me focus. Will taking ativan let me study or will I just fall asleep?
Anxiety,"what is your response to people who say ""well, everyone has anxiety?""","I hear this a lot, and it bothers me to no end. it is incredibly frustrating when people use this tired and uninformed argument. it's a fundamental ignorance of what anxiety is. they seem to willfully confuse people's everyday worrying about their career or something similar, with clinical anxiety. the former is rational, the latter is irrational and excessive. clinical anxiety is debilitating, impair your quality of life, impact your mental health, damage your relationships or impede you from forming new ones, etc. one is in the DSM-V, and one isn't.


 I've also been accused of ""chasing the dragon"" when I say that I'm on medication for anxiety, even if it's not controlled substance, although that really shouldn't matter. it's maddening. I could forgive them if not for the smug and judgemental overtones that usually accompany it. it's basically being shamed for having a mental health issue they don't understand, and they dismiss your mental health issue. sometimes I think maybe they don't intend to be demeaning, and it's a teachable moment, but it's hard to not get angry because it's so common, and I feel like they should know better.

If I like the person, then I would prefer meeting in real life and not text them 24/7.
My texts give me anxiety and i know it's not good for me.
Are small talks important in showing care for the person? So if I'm ghosting them, is it wrong? 
Should I be questioned about why I am not texting them? 
Should I feel guilty of not replying to them even if I'm online? 
I need them to understand that it's about me and not about them. 
Is is that If I need them, I need to yk put more effort? 
Is it really worth it if I'm stressing myself in the process? Texting is really easy for me but also the hardest thing ever. 
* My close friends know me, and prefer calling me.
* I'm talking about random small talks and not important text messages that actually give information."

Anxiety,"I don't know what to do with myself, I hope someone replies","I'm trying to work on getting a stable job and moving away from home, but it feels ***impossible***. The only places I can realistically apply to wouldn't pay me enough to cover even like a quarter of my most basic living expenses, and I'm a terrible candidate on paper to even be hired most anywhere. 

My living situation is changing to where I feel like the pressure to move has increased and accelerated, and obviously this is triggering my anxiety big time. These things are always something I've struggled with, but now it feels very urgent and all I can think about is becoming homeless. I just feel cornered with no options, no support, and no idea of what I'm going to do. It's incredibly depressing as well, my future feels devoid of momentum or hope. 

Can anyone who's been in this situation please just tell me their story, what did you do, any tips? Suggestions? I just really need some outside voices on this thing, because those around me don't tolerate it well. Whatever you have I'd appreciate it."

Anxiety,Stress Vomit or Gastritis?,"So I'm very new to all this I'm known in my family for being the least stressed least anxious person, but this past week I've had 2 episodes of vomiting right before going to college and a bloated stomach after eating breakfast and dry heaving.
What made me think it could be stress is cause I'm not really a big fan of the college atmosphere, sure i have made friends there but it doesn't keep me distracted enough. And even right now after dinner I felt a little uneasy remembering I had to wake up and go tomorrow and I've been fine this weekend having had 3 full proper meals without stomach ache or bloating. Could this be caused by anxiety of starting college and being around new people or could it just be cause season change and some sort of gastritis?
If it is anxiety, how do you calm down without taking deep breaths cause deep breaths when I feel bloated make me gag.

TLDR: Vomited twice this week, don't know if it's because anxiety or just a stomach bug"

Anxiety,Ativan addiction,"Please tell me I'm not becoming addicted
 I've got a 30 day supply and I've gone through half in a month and half. I was taking them every other day or so and now I'm getting panick if I'm not taking it every day."
Anxiety,What is this?,"I have ocd, bipolar, anxiety

It seems if something stresses me out I  can end up just sitting on the couch for hours in some weird state where I just can't get up and it can be very hard to snap out of. Usually ruminating and it can last for days. 

I am posting on anxiety because it seems it happens in any mood. 

Anyone experience this?"
Anxiety,Anxiety habits,When I get very anxious I have the urge to pick the skin around my finger nails. Is there anyone else who has this? I want to stop it so bad but I always end up doing it again. Does anyone have any advice for me?
Anxiety,Going to hair salon in two hours... feeling nervous. I get very anxious in hair salons. anyone feel the same?,"I always put off haircuts and blowouts as long as i can. Since im going to start a job tomorrow i need to get a blowdry and haircut. I already know the place and my stylist but i still feel nervous. I think im nervous since i feel so uncomfortable with how i look and im going somewhere where my looks will be somewhat focused on, my stylist can be chatty which i actually dont mind too much, i actually find it a bit better than awkward silence at times. But im nervous if he may be in bad mood today or something. and my hair is thick and curly so it will take some time to blow dry.

Or how i should act when its all finished, i always find it awkward acting like if i like my haircut or not... ughhhh. And i am nervous of walking in and all eyes on me, but i guess it will only be for few seconds. Still i dread the process every time. Im thankful for masks now at least!

Do you feel the same?"
Anxiety,Parents who have their own struggles with anxiety and/or introvert feelings?,"Those of you with anxiety and are introverts and have kids, how do you get passed your own daily thoughts when you have kids to raise every day?"
Anxiety,Driving again…,Hi! I am 24 F. I have been driving since I was 15. I have a seizure disorder which has always been pretty well managed but the last 6 months it flared up and I had one while driving and it was a bad experience for me. I have cptsd and severe anxiety however driving was always kind of a relaxing escape for me. I haven’t driven in 4 months and I hate it. I am a prisoner in my own home and I have lost all of my independence. I really want to get back into it now that the seizures are under control again but I am just scared about all of it. Any advice or wisdoms is appreciated. Thank you.
Anxiety,Overcoming Anxiety without Medication?,"Been extremely anxious for years. I think my worst issue is being a hypochondriac, which has let to legitimate physical symptoms that are not fun to deal with. Does anyone have any general advice on taking on anxiety without therapy or medication?

My only experience with taking medication was taking Zoloft a few years ago, just for a few days. It made me feel better, however I despise the idea that I need to take medication to function as a normal human being. 

Drunk, all over the place post, and I do apologize, but any info is appreciated. &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I hate anxiety meds. Any natural remedies that have helped any of you?"
Anxiety,Have any of you ever had a full on anxiety / panic attack?,"Just curious to know. I had 1, in the middle of traffic. Couldn’t breathe (gasping for air), body went numb, eventually was paralyzed. Truly thought I was dying. Felt like my soul was getting sucked into a black hole. Was praying to God to not let me die. Probably the most scary thing that happened. Also could literally feel and hear my heart beat (192 BpM). In addition it felt like a 20 minute never ending dropping roller coaster. After the attack my body felt stress for 7 months, I couldn’t even work. I had another 1 but not to the degree. Pretty damn scary."
Anxiety,It sucks that my life can’t be put on pause,"I’ve been battling the same thoughts and crippling fears in my head for over 8 months and I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that I’ve been fighting the same battle for this long. 

When I’m in school I look around and people are just living their life like everything is normal. I have not felt the same since before my episode. I feel like I’m grieving the person I used to be every single day while life goes on for other people."
Anxiety,Am I the only one,"Hey guys! Do you guys ever get anxiety, but no amount of advice seems helpful because that’s not the advice you wanted? I feel like I get reassurance from people but I always end up having anxiety afterwards. Nothing seems to help. It’s kind of difficult to describe."
Anxiety,Worried about increasing medication,"Hi guys! I’m(23f) not sure if I’m allowed to ask about this (I know no one on here can offer me medical advice) but I’m just looking for maybe some personal experiences. I started having severe anxiety when I was 16, i couldn’t leave the house and had to do all my schooling online for 6 months. I started Celexa very slowly and once I got to 20 mg daily I felt better! I was able to do so many things! However I never completely healed and still struggled with things- just to a lesser extent. The 20 mg just took the edge off, I did have some uncomfortable side effects when I started, but they passed. I am now 23, and for the last year or so my anxiety has been gaining traction, I’m struggling to do a lot of the basics again and depression is getting worse. My doctor has been encouraging me to increase my medicine from 20mg daily to 30mg. Again I will do this very slowly. A huge trigger for my panic attacks is taking medications, so I’m just so so terrified of raising my meds or changing them in anyway. But I also want to because I am struggling so much and in theory they should help. I worry about ruining the slight quality of life increase they have given me. Like if I go up on the doseage and it feels worse, will I be able to go back to 20 mg and be ok? Hoping I could have some insight to increasing meds and how that experience was for others that will hopefully encourage me to make the leap! Thanks(:"
Anxiety,I delete most of my posts and comments on reddit,"Because I hate knowing someone has seen and likely downvoted them. As a writer I have to come to terms with accepting criticism but man, I cant even handle posting on reddit without taking everything personally....!"
Anxiety,Heart Racing,"How many times roughly a day do you guys get periods of heart racing and out of breath. It's driving me insane. Going on just over 4 years now. I'm beyond sick of this condition. 

Nothing makes me anxious, I just get horrible symptoms daily after a panic attack in late 2017."
Anxiety,I hate living like this,"I don't know how much of this is my anxiety, how much of it is my OCD. Both play into each other and both are diagnosed.

My biggest fear is death. At the end of the day that's it, and uh...sucks, because can't really avoid that one forever, right? But the direct connection is that I'm deathly afraid of cancer and I can't go more than a few weeks without being terrified that I'm dying of something.

I'm on meds. They're clearly not working well. Things get worse if I try to mess with them. Right now, I can barely feel anything at all that isn't just anxiety. I can't escape it and every time I knock one fear down another one comes back up.

It's not fair that I have to live like this. It's not fair that I can't catch a break from my own mind. It's a hard thing to understand from an outside perspective - maybe that's why I've gone here. Ignoring it just turns me apathetic.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'll just take it down or won't post it at all. But if you ARE seeing this...I don't really know what I want from this. Advice? Reassurance? Just someone who understands?

I don't know. I don't know."
Anxiety,I keep having irrational fears and i dont know why,"As of a few months ago, I suddenly became scared of getting on trains, with the fear that theyll crash (resulting in me trying to avoid then, taking bus when i can and having frequent nightmares of train crashes) and another is of an explosion or meteor striking, any noise of an airplane causing my body temperature to rise and i get really scared, also causing nightmares.  

Ive tried to think back and the only possible explanations I can imagine was that my ex had both a severe fear of trains and meteors striking, but id never had these fears before and i dont understand why they would begin at our breakup, or how i could ""learn"" them in that way"
Anxiety,overthinking and being obsessive about my things,"It’s 2 am right now and i feel really anxious i
don’t know why i keep thinking there’s something wrong with me mentally, like lately i’ve feeling very detached and everything feels like a blur i feel like i forget so many things and this causes me to think my brain is like deteriorating or something i’m only 16 but my memory is so bad and etc. This might be just the cause of long term anxiety but it’s making me anxious i can’t even sleep."
Anxiety,Keep thinking about death,I can't go a day without thinking of death. I'll get it in my head that if I don't do certain things my family will die. It's usually just that I have to hold my breath but sometimes it's other things. Have any of you overcame your fear of death?
Anxiety,When do you trust your gut?,"I’m starting a job Tuesday, parents think it will be good for me. I’m 23 and have been doing nothing with my life. I went to college but life isn’t easy. I almost dropped out of high school, had multiple failed starts at college. Suffered endless bullying at school. I rely on my parents for housing and  if I didn’t take the job I’m not sure they wouldn’t have kicked me out. I do nothing because the anxiety of getting hurt again and how I’ll manage is immense. What do I do? Parents aren’t bad people but this feels like it’s going to kill me."
Anxiety,Why is googling medical symptoms so scary?,"I have a very bad habit in that when  i have any mild or moderate medical issue i go straight to google then i see the first things that pop up are cancer, needing surgery and possibly death. I do not understand why google allows this knowing they give so many people anxiety when if i were to go to a doctor they would not do that."
Anxiety,Driving Anxiety,"I've had people honk their horns and flash their lights at me for every reason imaginable. Flat tire. Forgetting to turn my lights on at night. Not moving at a green light etc. 

I was never a great driver, but I've gotten considerably better now. However, every time I see someone flash their lights or honk their horn it makes me incredibly paranoid as I think I am doing something illegal or there is something wrong with my car.

It has now gotten worse as at night I feel like everyone is flashing their lights, almost like I'm hallucinating, and it's making me incredibly stressed. Does anyone have any tips?"
Anxiety,Anyone got some good news for me?,"Hey, 

So I'm totally not sitting at work almost crying because I have - again - lost almost all of my self confidence and self-worth for some reason. 

Could really use some cheering up. 
How's your day going so far?"

Anxiety,Unsettling pregnancy dreams,"This post talks about pregnancy loss which may be triggering to some people.

I recently found out I’m pregnant. I’m almost two months and have my first appointment next week. While this pregnancy comes as a surprise I am trying to be mindful of this forming life. The thought of the future is too overwhelming for my anxious mind so I try to take it day by day. I’m also trying to find a therapist.

Now to the dreams. I’m already a person who has vivid dreams but I’ve been reading while pregnant you can have some pretty vivid dreams. Well for the last two nights I’ve dreamt of having what I believe are miscarriages. Since I am still early in my pregnancy anything can happen. I keep telling myself I’m not being pessimistic by thinking worse case scenario, I’m being realistic. But these dreams are extremely vivid and unsettling. I know they tied to my anxiety. 

Like I said I am trying to be mindful of this new life and apart of that is trying to get a grasp on my anxiety. Aside from therapy, any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to ease my mind a bit would be greatly appreciated!"
Anxiety,Scared of failing school,"I haven't been to school since November, and this week I went back. I struggle with social anxiety and have no friends. As soon as I got back my teachers were giving me midterm on top of midterm, so much stuff. 

Today I just couldn't go I felt really sick this morning and my whole body was tired despite going to bed at 8pm. Around December I weighed 120 pounds but all of a sudden I started losing weight randomly. I weighed 114 yesterday and today I weigh 110, my body feels super light and I'm shaking lots.

 My mom was very mad at me and my brothers didn't get up to go to school either (they are in elementary) they kept saying 'why doesn't Myname have to go to school?!?' Then my mom replied with 'well you know what's going to happen to her? She's going to have to repeat the grade!"" 
I'm so scared. I don't want to repeat the year, I've worked so hard to get here. Before 2 years ago I was a straight A student 90%- 100% on every test, I was every teacher's favorite. I've been trying really hard, having lots of internal conflicts trying to convince myself to go to school, to do my work, and to love myself. 

When I was in french class yesterday the teacher turned on a short audio book we had to listen to and reply to questions on paper. I couldn't understand a single. Thing. The lady was talking so fast her french accent was so thick I couldn't answer any of the questions. I've been in french class for  over 10 years why couldn't I understand.

 I'm ruining everyone's life I know they all hate me. My teachers probably hate me because I never turn in my work I'm just a huge burden on them. My parents hate me,  I'm ruining my siblings future they aren't going to school because of me and I'm ruining my own future. I feel like I'm crazy, I've imagined my future self hating me and being broke because I couldn't do school properly. I disappointed my whole family and all of my teachers that have ever taught me, all of their hard work only for me to be a failure."
Anxiety,Advice for Working,"So I've had anxiety all my life. I just turned 22. I can't hold down a job for the life of me. I'll work somewhere for a few days, get overwhelmed, leave, try again. I worked at a GS Station for 3 days before I stopped show ok my up. Worked at Cumberland farms half a shift before I had a panic attack and left. Worked 1 day at Walmart, no call no showed there. Worked at Amazon a month, then left. Longest job I've had was UPS for 3 months. 
How do I get over this and actually work. I get so overwhelmed and worried while at work. I'm about to try Dunkin Donuts so... Any advice on working with really bad anxiety? Ty in advance."
Anxiety,Any tips on how to calm stomach when having anxiety.,"At times I feel really anxious.My heartbeat rises and I feel nauseous.The bigger problem is my stomach.It feels like I need to use the bathroom immediately.I really don't like this because it can happen at any time even out of the blue.This gets annoying because I had a presentation I was ready and pumped up for but I felt really sick and had to postpone it.

Anxiety,I messed up an email,"Hello,

I'm in a tough spot at work. I had a deadline Wednesday of work I was supposed to submit. I got two reminder emails. It was very important. I submitted it by the deadline and bcc'd myself. 

Today, I got an email saying that I am being formally reprimanded and should meet with HR to discuss potential dismissal for failure to complete tasks. I found out I bcc'd myself but forgot to send it to the team lead.  I forwarded it to the team lead and hope the time stamp shows I did get it in on time. This is an internal matter so as far as I can tell, business wasn't distupted. Is this a common mistake or am I just stupid?"

Anxiety,Not wanting to eat when sad,"Anyone else doesn’t want to eat when feeling sad? I’ve never had issues eating but when I get depressed or stressed I just don’t want to eat, even if I’m really really hungry and feel like my body needs the food. I just feel like I don’t deserve to eat and just starve myself, idk how to describe it. Is this normal?
I should also add that I’ve never been medically diagnosed with anxiety or depression or any mental health issue, so Idek if it’s related to that."
Anxiety,Am I overreacting for having university choice worries?,"I recently decided which university I'm going to, but now that I've finished my application and been accepted I'm kinda freaking out, almost seeking out negative things about the city and everything else and worrying if I made the right choice, despite being convinced of it previously. Is this a normal reaction? How do I stop myself from panicking?"
Anxiety,How to get over overthinking and rumination?,I can’t stop myself from ruminating and I can’t distract myself
Anxiety,mental health is at its lowest and idk what to do,"recently, i feel like my mental health has been deteriorating and idk what to do. the past few months weren’t that bad but ive had some bad moments that have eventually led up to now. it just feels like my mind is consumed by so much negativity and im having so much issues with a various things that i feel so overwhelmed.

i feel like my physical health is a big part of this. earlier in 2021 i had so much ambition to become healthy, and fit. fyi im a very skinny and underweight person so it was a pretty big goal for me. that was until i decided to “dirty bulk” as it felt hard for me to gain weight. even still, it did not last long and i probably wont do it again. it felt like i just kept giving myself excuses to not eat healthy. that happened until mid last year, when started my job and i stopped working out and dieting completely.

i would completely like to start getting into fitness again, but right now im deep in a hole of laziness and junk/fast food addiction and its harder to get out than it seems. i feel like it impacts my mental health tremendously. one big part is advice that ive heard, to eat what i enjoy if im going to do a bulk but i found it hard to enjoy many of the healthier options and my mind just went to junk food. i also feel like i dont drink enough water as i should.

another big part is my job which i just kinda mentioned. ever since i started (mid 2021), my lack of motivation started increasing as i was becoming more lazier because of my job. it felt very hard to accustom gym life into work life because i have full availability. something my therapist told me was to just go even if i felt lazy and essentially force myself to do things but it feels so hard. i requested for pto in a couple weeks so i would have a small break to try to adjust myself thankfully

one thing that’s affecting my mental health that i feel a bit more embarrassed to talk about is my romantic life. i tend to still maintain a few obsessions when it comes to relationships and its a trait i feel i need to let go of. it does not benefit me and i am afraid of becoming too obsessive. i also feel like my friend who dont get me wrong, i enjoy the company of, but he is kinda a bad influence on my view of relationships because ive never had any urgency to get a girlfriend. ive always felt like it’ll come along the way but he is the opposite, coming out of a relationship and having such an urgency and desperation to get back into one. somehow it feels like this tendency is latching onto me which i dont want to happen.

one last thing i should mention is sleep and gaming. sleep has always been a big issue for me and it is not getting any better. staying up late at night doesnt even feel fun anymore. i feel like this is why i wasnt able to really progress when i used to work out. now about my gaming, i feel like video games are the only thing that make me happy right now. i love video games but they are detrimental to my sleep since i stay up late playing them and i lose time during the day. i cant let go of video games but i need to fix my entire schedule. my internal clock is so messed up and i find it hard to sleep at a reasonable time

anyways i hope someone read this because i seriously need the help rn. i want to cry but its so hard. i was just trying to sleep but my head is just overwhelmed by all these thoughts. my head feels like such a dark place right now. i feel so hateful and pessimistic towards a lot of things which is not a pleasing feeling and it doesnt make things any better. any advice would be appreciated"
Anxiety,Will I be prescribed medication (if deemed appropriate) at my first GP appointment?,I have a GP appt for a GAD diagnosis today
Anxiety,Do I need to see another therapist?,"So a little background, I’ve had anxiety (OCD) and a panic disorder since I was 7. but diagnosed later on and I’m 18 now. my first panic attack was in second grade and I’ve had them consistently since. I’m a very “go go go” type of personality so I’ve tried my best to make sure my anxiety doesn’t hold me back and I know when it starts to get bad. It’s still really difficult because I’m constantly stressed out, I get panic attacks while shopping almost every time and I’m just exhausted from the stress. 

I started seeing a therapist in the fall for the first time ever, my parents never really did much for my anxiety. They knew I had it but would tell me to just get over it so I ended up developing my own coping strategies.

My therapist doesn’t seem to understand how bad it is because every time I tell her what is bothering me, I also tell her what I’ve done to overcome it (bringing a friend along, going for walks, reaching out for support etc) and she tells me I’m doing everything right. In fact she told me out of all her clients I understand myself the best and I’ve basically been teaching myself exposure therapy this whole time. This is cool to know, but in a way it bothers me because I feel like my anxiety is still really bad and I don’t think she understands that. Is therapy going to help me at all? Or am I already “good” lol. Maybe it’s just not working with this one? I’m not sure."
Anxiety,I don't know if it's my GAD or if I am actually dying from an illness I have :(,
Anxiety,Anxious that I might have covid,"So for some background I'm 17, I have asthma, and I was recently in the ER for a separate issue. Day before yesterday was when I went, I now today began feeling generally sick with a mild cough and odd feeling in my chest when I cough. Minor flu like body aches followed, making me worry about covid since it was said to be similar to the flu. I'm scared that suddenly while I'm sleeping or while I'm not it will sparraticaly become severely impacting my breathing, (even though right now it isn't at all). Right now I do not feel as though I need to see a doctor, nor do I want to bother my parents again about another medical thing.. my father is at risk too and since we live in a small place it's really hard to distance out of caution.. please help me."
Anxiety,"looking into therapy, confused about some things","i’m finally looking into therapy to deal with my issues better. however, i haven’t ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, but i can tell that there’s something major wrong with my mental health. do i need a diagnosis before i go see a therapist? or does the diagnosis come later? i’m super clueless as this is my very first time exploring therapy as an option. would really appreciate some insight."
Anxiety,I just had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in months…,"My body still feels like static TV and my face is all puckered up and my chest hurts so bad. I almost called 911 because I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I’ve not had a panic attack with severe physical side effects in sick a long time and I thought my meds were controlling my panic attacks better than I thought. I don’t know why I’m posting this I just still feel really…. “Off” I don’t know if something medically is happening to me though and I’m scared as fuck. Like fuck my I have panic attacks at least once a day and in a bad day I can have 5 or 6. Even taking 2.5mg of Ativan a day my anxiety is absolutely torture. I can’t work and I’ve missed so many therapy appointments that my therapist has discharged me “uncooperatively” even though I try to tell her what’s going on and she is always very understanding. I just got the letter in the mail yesterday and I feel like a total failure because my anxiety is keeping me from getting the help I really need. Fuck. My. Life. How do you guys do it? I don’t feel suicidal but I wish I could just disappear. Or just become invisible and live totally alone. My girlfriend is on the brink of breaking up with me because she doesn’t know how to help me and my friends all left me because of my bipolar disorder, OCD, and anxiety/panic disorder. It’s so hard right now and I just needed to get this out lmao."
Anxiety,Health anxiety and COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Health anxiety and COVID-19 diagnosis.

25yom, I was diagnosed 10 days ago with COVID (self test) and I’m assuming it’s Omicron since 99.9% of US cases are but anyway, my symptoms have began to resolve. Not as congested, cough is better and so on so forth. Now I’m dealing with chest pain that radiates into my back and underneath my left pectoral area. Even though my symptoms are improving I am freaking out that maybe I have pneumonia, a pulmonary embolism, a dissecting aorta and so on and so forth. Nothing seems to make the pain better or worse and it comes and goes whenever it wants to. I’m super worried about it even though my family which knows about my health anxiety has repeatedly reminded me that it is probably nothing and I’m getting better and that these things just take time. Idk what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going crazy and I’m low key scared to death."
Anxiety,Cavemen - Selfwritten poem about what I think might be Cavesyndrom,"Good day folks!  
I am a newbie to social anxiety and don't know how to deal with it. Right now I am working in a foreign country and basically have to spend most of the time in quarantine so my bad thoughts come back. In the past, I found the Lockdowns quite boring but really peaceful and after everything opened up again I was even tensed in the companion of friends. Moreover, last autumn my university didn't accept my bachelor thesis because of some error in their system and I had to fight with them for 3 months. That made my brain go completely bonkers. As I can't get professional help here I just wrote all my stuff down. Maybe some of you have similar experiences and can take something from this. Moreover, I can highly recommend this kind of cheap therapy.

Lyrics:  
Hey guys remember the interesting snack this Chinese in 2019 got  
And since then everybody on this planet is facing an invisible flood  
Containing never-ending waves forced mankind to separate and go back to its caves  
Now a medical miracle happened step out there is land in sight  
This time it really might be the final tide

Can’t handle so much freedom it makes me go insane  
 Spend 4 months in single room waiting for a verdict in pain  
 Now every look I get hurts like a stab  
 Only when I feel alone I am in my comfort zone  
 Cope it with more screentime, cover that as metime  
 Guess you can win in court and still lose trust in people and sadly yourself  
 Guess know I can choose between being bored or overwhelmed  
 Not really how you imagine the end of isolation  
 My lungs are fine still I feel like one of the plagues patients  
 Others are okay as long as they stay strangers  
 Was fine with the cafe at the corner, as long  they were just neighbors  
 Suddenly they call me best guest, invite me four a private breakfast  
 My heart rate I better dont measure  
 Since when do compliments mean pure pressure   
 You got sniped at by bureaucrats not in war trenches  
 They watch you rise a coffeecup no need to fall for trembles  
 A night later junkies try to rob my phone  
 I fight them off calmly coz I am just on my own  
 Spend my sleep imagining the horror  
 That was yesterday and might be tomorrow  
 Waking up thinking I must be too late  
 See messages from my boss and straight get afraid  
 Oh no lol it's just a well-done mate  
    
 Yogis say just stay in the moment and be aware  
 How if the body reacts faster than you can think just dont care  
 Tough when you used to be a dreamer whose mind is longer a safe space  
 And something inside tries to jump from one to the next worst case  
 A single doubt or sound makes your body quake in lightspeed  
 All serotonin vanishes and confidence plays hidenseek  
 The daily life unmutes – I just wanna contribute  
 The woman infront gets nude – Sees my look and gets confused  
 Aks her if her shape makes me feeling blues – Na your hot I just need 2 minutes to switch the mood  
 It takes time for my body to accept it deserves your boobs  
 Dining with la familia should make you feel cozy  
 I get tensed like Tony Soprano would make a bad Mafiosi  
 The only lad who gets my mind straight to ease  
 Is my I guess 2 years old niece  
 N That therapy dog I maybe saw for five days  
 She grew into a person I faded into video calls and games  
 I like that she can't cheat, well but she can’t even speak  
 Only when I'm tipsy I can judge my fear sober  
 Wonder if drinking is healthier than this hormone rollercoaster  
 My anxieties eat me alive  
 So desperate even fight them with boring exercise  
 Try to master meditation though it seems hopeless  
 Maybe coz try so hard it takes ages to make progress  
 Where is my fucking pay off this doesn't makes any sense  
 I know how to be funny make enough money  
 and have it easy to make friends  
 Panic parasite did you not see who you chose  
 I have the spirit of a sloth I am not your right host  
 Don’t like living healthy can’t waste this time   
 Though my back won’t agree I should be in my prime  
 I love mocking people but under this circumstance, it feels like a wrong number  
 You caged me into the body of Bambi but my brain works still like motherfucking thumper  
 

Oh no wait the 5 minutes passed  
The attack is over just forget what I said  
Now the hormones bounce back everything goes reverse  
and I feel like the craziest Mofo of the universe,  
 

Oh no wrong hope, now there is omicron you can stay a homo digitalis everything is fine"

Anxiety,Citalopram - Thoughts?,"Hey there, 

I'm currently going through somewhat of a tough time.  I feel anxious quite a lot of the time, wondering always the worst-case scenario, if someone would do something to me, and always seeking reassurance about things.  Also going through a tough time with a number of things in life which has all come at me at once which I do not want to go into detail about.

Anyways, I spoke to a doctor today (my GP sucks in my opinion, even the convo with the doctor today I got the vibe she didn't know much about citalopram), but she prescribed it to me. I was on it previously, but I can't remember the exact experience I had except it killed my sex drive.

I am now here a few years on, more anxious, more worried, and I am just curious as to your thoughts about Citalopram?  I see it can cause permanent sexual dysfunction?  She prescribed me 20mg to start with and I am nervous about starting it.  I would say my anxiety is really bad, but my mood is medium - I can still joke around and be okay.   I also take anti-histamines for sleep - which I do not want to be on. Would this help?  And that also reminds me, does citalopram cause memory problems/dementia?

Just wanted your thoughts and experiences on this?"
Anxiety,Citalopram - Thoughts?,"Hey there,

I'm currently going through somewhat of a tough time. I feel anxious quite a lot of the time, wondering always the worst-case scenario, if someone would do something to me, and always seeking reassurance about things. Also going through a tough time with a number of things in life which has all come at me at once which I do not want to go into detail about.

Anxiety,"Anxiety and ""not feeling present""","For the most part I managed to cope and overcome my health and social anxiety. The big problem that remains however is the inability to focus and be present in the moment. If I'm having a conversation, the stress is causing me to zone out. I'm able to talk but it feels like autopilot and I'm not really there in that moment. This creates grater suffering because I feel so distanced from my environment and myself. 

Anyone dealing with something similar ? How did you manage to overcome this ?"
Anxiety,scarring alopecia?,"okay, i already know this post is going to sound silly. i don’t have scarring alopecia, my mom does. and it happens to be causing both of us a ton of anxiety. she hasn’t lost a ton of hair yet, it’s just thinning near her part. it’s only noticeable if you look close. however, i can see that it’s causing her a ton of anxiety and insecurity and it makes me really really sad. i don’t want her to be bald. it’s also apparently irreversible, which is making me more nervous. she’s seeing a specialist for treatment, but i’m still worried it won’t get better."
Anxiety,Sheer terror when I have to talk in class,"I am in grad school and my classes are all virtual. When I get called on or any time I have to participate in discussion, I all but black out. My heart pounds in my chest, my ears get hot, sometimes I even hear ringing in my ears. I’ve always experienced some amount of anxiousness when talking in class, but lately it’s gotten so much worse. I really don’t know why this happens! I don’t remember it being this bad in undergrad, though those classes were in person. The shitty thing is that now a lot of my classes are graded largely on participation. 

Anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? Any advice?"
Anxiety,Can’t eat or drink,TLDR I have NEVER had anxiety issues but the past few days I haven’t been able to eat or drink without throwing up. I have an unrelated issue with my esophagus narrowing but I just got dilated so I know it’s not that. I genuinely don’t know what’s causing this could it be anxiety? Yesterday night it went away and I could eat but now it’s back why? Any anxiety sufferers see any similarities?
Anxiety,I think I’m afraid of the dark?,"I’ve been unable to sleep at night recently until closer to when it’s light out, and if I do try to sleep at night, I have to have a light on. This only developed in like the past couple of weeks. I thought my sleep schedule was just messed up from my holiday, but tonight I realized I am actually frightened to go to sleep in my room at night! I haven’t felt this way since I was a child! I also find myself fearing nightmares or dwelling on fear when I lie down.
Anyone have any tips on how to soothe sleep anxiety? I want to get back on a good schedule and not be nocturnal 😅"

Anxiety,Could anxiety cause dizzy spell,"Hey guys I'm 20 years old, 6,0 and weigh 205. Conditions I have are anxiety disorder. 

Okay so I was having a good time playing games but while doing it I started to feel dizzy but it went away. But after a while it hit me so strong I got really dizzy like my world was spinning and moving left and right. I went to go lie down I fell asleep after and hour and a half. Now I wake up in the middle of the night and still feel a bit dizzy but not as strong. I was about to have a panic attack but calmed myself down. 

Why is my dizzy spell lasting so long. Could it be anxiety? What could have caused this? I am lowkey freaking out because I still feel dizzy."
Anxiety,Cigarettes,"Hey ex-smokers, how much did quitting actually help your anxiety? I've been wanting to quit for a long time (I'm 31F been smoking since I was 17), but.. you know.. anxiety.. and addiction.  🤣

In addition, did your anxiety sky rocket during withdrawal? If so, how long did it take for you to level back out? I think I'm getting close to taking the plunge, but I want to be prepared."
Anxiety,failed an exam bc of anxiety,A few days ago I had an oral exam (business english - not my native language) for which I was well prepared but as soon as I started talking I just couldn’t form correct sentences and my mind went blank. It was my first oral exam in uni and I was terrified of failing since I’m usually great in English. My professor offered me to exercise a few times with them to get more comfortable and I’ll do that but… how can I prevent my mind going completely blank when I’m super anxious and afraid? I have another exam in a week.
Anxiety,Decaf tea,"Hi all.

I used to drink tea loads and loved the clear headedness I got after, but the caffeine would usually send my anxiety into overdrive.

Wanting to know if decaf tea provides that same level of mental clarity as thinking I’ll drink decaf when I wake up as normally extremely anxious and unfocused for a good few hours each morning."
Anxiety,Lost my spark,"Anyone else feel like they’ve lost that natural spark/warmth because of their anxiety. 

The sort of warmth that represents being present in the moment and just happy and relaxed.

Haven’t had it for a while now and I don’t wanna look back on my life in the future and think I didn’t enjoy life to the fullest because of my anxiety, but it’s difficult  to enjoy life at the moment because I’ve lost that spark."
Anxiety,What's the best way to stay informed besides the news?,"A common theme here for people, myself included, is that the news freaks us out. I try to avoid it and it does help but, if I start watching after a while it feels like I missed a lot and everything's worse than when I stopped watching. I get an instant panic attack and it takes a lot out of me to calm down. Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,Sensory overload,"Anyone feel like sensory overload contribute to their anxiety? I have three kids and the minute they wake me up in the morning it’s chaos. Between them yelling, loud tablet noises, tv shows, I feel like I’m losing it. I don’t know how to deal with this without taking all of those things away from them, which doesn’t seem fair."
Anxiety,Metoprolol succinate,"(29, f) (hypothyroidism and t2 diabetes) I have been having palpitations and rapid heartbeats. Earlier my doctor had prescribed me propranolol but I didn’t take them for the fear of my heartbeat going too low. I have stopped taking coffee and chocolate and started cardio, it has helped my palpitations a lot. But last 10 days my dad got covid and I had a horrible anxiety attack and my heartbeat is usually elevated these days. I keep imagining something will happen to my dad or me and it will be horrible. Today I got ecg and echo, both normal but my bp was 140/100 probably due to increased heartbeats. The doctor prescribed me metoprolol succinate but I have the same anxiety that it will really lower my heart rate, which remains around 75-85 when I am not anxious. What are your experiences with metoprolol? I will start taking it from tomorrow."
Anxiety,anxiety attacks at work because coworkers hate me,"So i recently started a part time job (waitressing) and im like the youngest there(?) since im still a student. And basically its the full timers job to take care of the part timers and make sure theyre doing their job properly. I think the full timers have something against me? They treat the other part timers with respect but when it comes to me, theyre all snappy and rude. Theres this one other part timer thats like super extroverted and friendly and whenever she talks to them, theyre ok with her slacking off and everything but they get pissed when i talk to the other part timers. Whenever i ask them questions, the full timers are like 'cant u use your eyes/brain' and i dont know what im doing wrong. I admit im a little scatterbrained and probably not as good at the job as the others. But ive only worked there for a week. Im super (overly) polite because my anxiety does not allow me to stand up for myself. What should i do. Im planning to work there for another two months or so but everytime i get back from work, im like sobbing. Today, a full timer even apologised to me saying she was in a bad mood but she treated the rest of the workers fine? What am i doing wrong? do i just have ashit personality? For the entire of today, i was on the edge of tears which is bad because i think some of the cusstomers could tell? which is very not good"

Anxiety,How to win over Anxiety,[removed]
Anxiety,Anxiety,Hey guys! I read this blog about anxiety and it feels kinda relatable. Check it out and let's have a conversation where we each can share our similar experiences. Kind of a virtual help group if you guys are up for it
Anxiety,"I fked up my 3rd Year University Paper, feeling lost and dissociated with everything","It was supposed to be an easy paper, I prepared so hard for it. But a combination of events just fked me over. 

I really don't know what to do now, my parents paid so much to send me overseas for uni, it feels like now I can't even repay them back with decent results.

The least I could do is score a 1st Class Honours for my degree, but due to this fk up, it is putting this at risk. I am scared of the trials ahead of me, the huge amount of extra effort I need to put in to make up for the mistake. Especially the anxiety that will come with the pressure of compensating for this incident."
Anxiety,...I'm scared I'm losing my friends.,"I have these friends, we've been friend for 5 years at this point. We're a close knit group of people, and I really can't imagine my life without them. We've been through stuff together...

It's just whenever I confide in them about something... I get told I'm overthinking. If I apologize, I get told to stop. It's obvious they care ,,, but sometimes I feel like they're tired of me. Even though they told me to always speak about whats on my mind...It's gotten to the point that I'm scared they all have a seperate discord server without me...and that they're happier there. (We mostly speak through discord)

I've lost friends before because of how my brain works, overthinking everything they say to me... 

I'm really tired... I just need help ...I need advice. Should I give them space? Or talk to them...not confront them though, I probably won't even mention my discrod server theory..."
Anxiety,advice needed,"I feel like i’ve suffered from anxiety since i was in kindergarten. i can vividly remember having some sort of anxiety attacks and heart palpitations at 6 years old (very randomly) and thinking i was dying. I’ve been to therapy on and off my whole life but i can’t find someone i’m fully comfortable/connect with. for the past year or so I wake up at 4 am with intense anxiety and cannot go back to sleep. this anxiety stays with me all day and comes from the most simple thought. a thought as simple as “i need to take my brother to the mall tomorrow” will have me up all night &amp; feeling like i cant/don’t want to do anything. A couple months ago i finally built up the courage to tell my doctor and he basically told me that it’s all in my head and to do breathing exercises.
I would like to know how others deal with this on their own. 
Should I ask for a different primary doctor? Would another doctor be able to offer me more help?
I don’t know how I feel
about a therapist anymore considering it’s hard to find a good one in my area and my insurance only covers the most basic ones. 
Living like this is torture at this point. I don’t see my friends, stopped going to school, and have a hard time getting up to go to work in the mornings."
Anxiety,Heart Palpitations,"*not asking for medical advice* 

I’ve had anxiety since I was younger and as I’ve gotten older I’ve experienced heart palpitations off and on. Last year I went to see a cardiologist because my father died young of heart disease and I’m not in the best shape. I wore a monitor for palpitations for 48 hours and they found nothing. To clear my mind I had an EKG, Echo and CT scan.. all came back perfectly clear. But I have been having consistent heart palpitations (out of rhythm) for the past 3 days. I just started a new position and started my period so I’m not sure if that’s contributing. Anyone else get consistent heart palpitations randomly? Again not asking for medical advice, just wanting to hear similar situations. 

Thank you."
Anxiety,Flying with panic attacks and health anxiety,
Anxiety,i’m so anxious,"this past month is i’ve so anxious. everyday at school i have a panic attack, i feel nauseous 24/7 bc of the anxiety and i feel like i’m going to faint. i don’t know what to do. this is the worst my anxiety has ever been :("
Anxiety,How do you do with matcha?,Coffee definitely makes my anxiety worse but I’m a bit of a gym rat and find my lifts suffer big time when I don’t drink caffeine. Has anyone found matcha to be better with their anxiety? I just really need a little of something to get me going before the gym.
Anxiety,"DAE struggle with imposter syndrome? Anybody got any strategies that help you get through it? I've been trying to reframe my perspectives on my perceived inadequacies, but it's hard",
Anxiety,Buspar and weight gain,"Hi there. Considering starting low dose Buspar for some general anxiety. I t take a low dose lamotrigine which has been very helpful but I think it increases my appetite. This is a problem for me because I have an eating disorder. Anyone have anything to report regarding Buspar and weight?

Thank you in advance! Really appreciate the support!"
Anxiety,Medications,"Is anyone taking Buspar and Zoloft at the same time?? I’m on 30mg of Buspar 2x per day, and 25 mg of Zoloft 1x per day. 
I just started this week and I am worried that it’s too much. I am having a lot of side effects (shakiness, chills, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, hight HR) 
Worried that I’m taking too much medicine at once."
Anxiety,"Please Help, I Want Chikfila, But I'm too Anxious too Ask!","So I'm at work right now. I'm new here, working in IT with just my boss in our area. I'm very shy and have a hard time opening up to people. Usually on Fridays someone in the office makes a run to go get everyone lunch. They have asked me a few times before, but I have politely declined, because I have a gluten allergy.  Yesterday my boss said that today they were gonna do Chikfila. I love Chikfila, and grilled nuggets won't upset my stomach. My boss isn't here today, so it's just me in the IT room. I really want some nuggets, but I'm very anxious about asking the front desk lady if they're going to get Chikfila today. So far I haven't heard anyone mention it. Every time I leave my area to go ask somebody, they look super busy, so I go sit back down.lunch is in an hour and 45 minutes...what do I do? I know this sounds silly, but yeah."
Anxiety,Gained anxiety from a life event,"25 yr old here. I had some anxiety through middle/high school but since then, I gained more confidence and felt that my anxiety had pretty much gone away. For years, I've been doing great. But then in March of 2020, my work environment became very toxic where I was working around the clock, I couldn't eat because it'd just come back up, always shaking, no sleep, didn't feel valued, and constant butterflies in my stomach. I didn't feel listened to when I brought it up to my manager so I lived like this pretty much every day for two months. My mental health was the lowest that it's ever been in my life. My situation has changed since then and life definitely isn't as crazy, but I feel that anxiety has become a bigger part of my life now. 

I left the toxic job for a new job during the summer of last year and thought that would relieve my anxiety. This job is much better in terms of work/life balance and there's really nothing significant that should be giving me anxiety. But it's like every email I get, every meeting I have, every new task where I don't know 100% what to do gives me anxiety. It's definitely not as bad as when I was working in a toxic environment, but I know it's there... 

I just want to go back to how I felt before without the constant anxiety :/ anyone else go through something similar or have any tips?"
Anxiety,Having a panic feeling right as I’m about to sleep. As if my brain is afraid to fall asleep.,"I’m someone who has on and off suffered from derealization and depersonalization where I essentially just feel out of it suddenly or out of my
body. Sometimes sleep is what has helped me not feel that way when those bouts get bad.

About a week and a half ago I noticed j had these tired lines under my eyes I was self conscious about and thought it was due to sleep and ever since then I’ve had such terrible sleep. I know I need to sleep because of work, general life energy, and to not be so self conscious of these lines and suddenly I have these panics before I sleep. 

It’s like suddenly sleep is my energy. I’ve slept fine my whole life but now suddenly when I try to sleep my heart races right when I’m feeling myself actually fall asleep. As if my brain is like “oh there it is you’re about to sleep!” And I’ve made an anxiety about letting myself go to fall asleep.

I was going to try melatonin but I don’t want to have to rely on a sleep aid. I can’t for my life of me figure out why sleeping is so hard now and I’m so scared this will never go away"
Anxiety,Is this a good way to ask for further medication for my anxiety from the doctor? I just want help.,"Sooo I have very bad anxiety. I've been on Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor, and Buspirone and none of it really helps. I've had to go to the ER a couple of times to get stitches because when I feel super overwhelmed sometimes I cut myself to make my head stop. I'm in therapy as well, I go every Monday but I am still plagued by these anxiety attacks. I'm too nervous to go in and talk about needing something more because I don't want to sound like I'm searching for drugs.

I bought two 1 mg xanax pills from my friend 2 months ago and I break off a quarter of it sometimes when I am feeling overwhelmed. It works like wonders and calms me down. I'm just too scared to go in and ask for further anxiety help because I don't want to seem like I am pill seeking. I don't want xanax so I can abuse it I just want help because my anxiety never goes away.

I refused for a long time to even go in and talk about it because I'm embarrassed that my anxiety isn't enough to get further medication for. But my boyfriend has been telling me I need to go in because he has to be around me when I have my anxiety freak outs and he says I definitely need it. 

I'm also scared to go in because I'm too anxious to talk to them and I know as soon as I get in there I won't be able to remember everything I was going to say to explain how bad my anxiety is. My boyfriend recommended me writing it all down so I can go in and just read what I wrote so I don't forget anything. He even said he could go in with me so I could be less anxious and talk to them. But I feel like me bringing in a piece of paper to talk about my anxiety seems crazy and theyll think I'm a drug addict. 

But I have even stopped drinking alcohol and smoking weed because it makes my anxiety worse so I don't even do anything like that anymore and I want my brain to stop constantly searching for the worse case scenario and me literally having to stop whatever I'm doing for like 1-3 hours to try to get myself back to normal so I can function. I'm just really scared to go in and talk to them but do you think if I wrote everything down about how my day to day life is even after trying a bunch of medication and therapy and read it to them would they think I'm crazy?"
Anxiety,Help!!! I am having GAD and Health anxiety,"I have GAD and health anxiety. I get mild symptoms ( very mild) but they scare the shit out of me when they happen. I always imagine the worst in my head and over think about it. There are days which I spend good and comfortable where I think I recovered and living a happy life but no !! Some uncomfortable shit happens and I am back to anxiety and the you all know or might know what happens then. Parents don't understand, no one understand how hard it is......... I hate everyone around me cause in an indirect way they are responsible for this because of the way raised me and by the facts they poured in my head raising me............. Please give me advice to get better 
Please 🙏🏻"
Anxiety,"Boss said I need mental health help, and I had to be terminated from my job because of my mental health, but the people closest to me don't believe me and keep telling me they have it worse.","I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I have been struggling to be able to afford or find a way to get free mental health help. Every job I've had has skirted around giving me full time so that they didn't have to pay premiums for health insurance, so I've lived a long time without any stable or decent form of help. I've had to just deal with my mental health and hope I didn't lose my job if it continued to decline. My sister would only take advantage of it. She would steal my food, my things and tell me I probably just misplaced it again. My mother constantly would tell me to be open about my mental health, but then when I tried she would immediately turn around and tell me she had it worse at my age and that my mental health is great compared to hers. She says that I have a nice job, nice family, and a bunch of other good things so that my anxiety shouldn't be bad, that I'm just being dramatic. She keeps demanding what's causing the panic attacks to trigger and I don't know what to tell her because there ***is***  no triggers. They just ***happen***. 

Part of me feels like she's right. Maybe I don't have mental health issues, maybe I'm just being dramatic. Denmark isn't going to allow a mental liability like me into their country. I'd be a burden to them right out of the gate, even though I'm just trying to move to my s/o to live happier. Every time I try to take baby steps in the right direction someone comes in to tell me I'm doing it wrong, that medication will never help me, so don't try to get it. And it's usually the people that I'm closest to relationship-wise. My s/o was the first and only person who, instead of telling me ""I have it worse, suck it up"" when he saw me go through long episodes of deep anxiety or depression, he told me he understood and I knew I could actually truely believe he actually meant it. 

I'm fighting with a darker part of me every day and the people who mean the most to me, are fighting for the wrong side of myself. I don't know if I have enough fight left in me to fight myself ***and***  my family."
Anxiety,Anxiety and heartburn,"Anyone else get some crazyyyy heartburn when they are anxious and then they feel more anxious cause of the heartburn?! 
Cause currently it’s a crappy cycle and I’m getting sick of it. I don’t care about any other anxiety symptoms just heartburn does me over so hardcore"
Anxiety,Worried I won’t be taken seriously,"Had a GP appt about my anxiety- she suggested self referral to ‘minds matter’ where CBT is offered.

I asked about staring medication and she said it’s not her place to give it as it’s a psychiatric issue but therapists can’t prescribe medication?


Anyways, the minds matter assessment will take place in like 2 weeks and I’m just worried that I won’t be taken seriously because I’m high functioning meaning I won’t get the help I need.

I keep gaslighting myself which is even worse :("
Anxiety,Anxious Tics,"Hello fellow anxious humans, I have a very active anxious tic, I crack my knuckles. But I've been doing this for years and it's becoming painful and I'm worried about permanent damage in my hands when I get older. Does anyone have any tips on how I can stop or switch to something else? I don't like fidget toys like cubes or those big popping things. I don't like to have to carry something around. Is there a better fidget device?"
Anxiety,What are CBT effects on physical symptoms of anxiety?,"I've never been able to control my panic attacks and anxiety symptoms with therapy alone but I'm curious for those who have, did you find that your physical symptoms went away or got better?

My challenge is that I get a lot of heart palpitations, choking while sleeping, stomach churning etc. As one of my first symptoms of anxiety.

What is your experience?"
Anxiety,Feeling worried about EKG results and really anxious on the Holter…,"Had an EKG yesterday and it said the reading was ‘abnormal’ with nonspecific T wave abnormalities. But the doctor said that it looked normal. I am now on the 2 week CAM monitor where they stick the monitor on your chest and it measures your heart rate 24/7. I’m sure it will capture things better. But I was wondering why the computer reading said ‘abnormal’ ? It’s kind of freaking me out. Also, I can’t stop obsessing over the monitor. Anyone had this before?"
Anxiety,Worried I won’t be taken seriously,"Had a GP appt about my anxiety- she suggested self referral to ‘minds matter’ where CBT is offered.

I asked about starting medication and she said it’s not her place to give it as it’s a psychiatric issue but therapists can’t prescribe medication? Unless maybe they can recommend it along with cbt and maybe request a psychiatric referral from a GP? Idk.

My thoughts are EXHAUSTING. Constantly thinking ‘what if’ and catastrophising.
It makes me bitter towards people because I think that people are gonna abandon me and I start hating when people talk to my friends, I can’t concentrate on school work (and my grades are dropping), when I’m anxious, I can’t concentrate which also means that when I try to alleviate the anxiety by doing something I like, it doesn’t help. I delay my eating time by hours because I’m scared to eat in front of people or I’ll only eat a bit and eat the rest at home, I loose sleep bc of the anxiety, I  just feel so stuck when I’m anxious, like when I’m in the moment, I can’t do anything. It stops me from socialising well and making new friends as I’m so scared that they’re judging me. I can’t enjoy being out because I’m preoccupied with losing time, I can’t relax when I have lots of  time to relax because I spend that time worrying about not spending it productively enough (which in itself is bad for my MH), physical symptoms are horrible. I’m just really worried I won’t be able to cope next year as I’ll be at uni away from home.

It really does bring my quality of life down massively."
Anxiety,Severe anxiety over choosing between 2 careers without knowing which one will be better to progress in,"How do I pick? :(

Anxiety,I do so much,"I feel like I do so much for others I buy gifts tell them what a great person they are and help and comfort them in a very caring way. but it never gets repaid. I know have support and people care yet it feels like none is watching out for me, none is there to catch me when I fall none notices when I am sad but everyone noticed when someone else just has a bad day. I cut, I have anxiety and depression I deal with the everyday notion of do I want to jump off a bridge and just end it all but I don't. why? I don't know at this point. I just feel like everyone hates me, that everyone thinks I smell bad and everyone thinks I am annoying, and to counter that I give others money and gifts so that they will like me when truly I don't think anyone does, it's so lonely and unfair yet for feeling this way I am selfish."
Anxiety,Does anyone else have a huge procrastination problem?,"I posted this on r/bipolar2 a few days ago because I have both mental illnesses, but I thought I’d post here too to hear more opinions. I think it might even be a bigger anxiety issue than bipolar issue.

I have a HUGE procrastination issue. Stuff like homework stresses me out so much that instead of just getting it over with, I just lay in bed on my phone or eat instead of doing it when I need to. Sometimes when I try to make myself get up or do it I almost have a panic attack at the thought of getting out of bed to do homework, so I just don’t. Does anyone relate to this or have any tips?"
Anxiety,Something amazing just happened,"I have major anxiety/depression along with c-ptsd. I graduated college recently, been unemployed for about 3 months, and I've been struggling to find a new job because I keep having panic attacks during interviews and it freaking sucks. 

I've had to remove myself in the middle of interviews to go and cry/hyperventilate in my car many times, and have missed out on so many opportunities because of this. It's embarrassing and I was ashamed of myself for getting so triggered by such a simple interaction.

I completely forgot I had a phone interview this morning, and when the recruiter began asking me questions I started talking myself in circles. I felt myself panicking and I was convinced I was tanking the interview, so I hung up.

Just as I was about to start beating myself up for sabotaging yet another offer, the recruiter messaged me asking if the call had dropped. I wasn't going to respond at first, but I pulled myself togetherand called back.

I'm still not sure if this email saying I got the job is a prank or not."
Anxiety,Is this a result of my anxiety,"I always have to keep my plan for the future ready and I mean really far into the future like I’ll be anxious if I can’t plan for the future to the dot

Anxiety,I missed out on work,I was supposed to start work today but my anxiety and thoughts got the best of me … I feel like such a failure. I will never make anything of myself . I wish I didn’t have anxiety. I wish I was able to go out into the world and be a social butterfly. That is totally impossible for me to do. All I can do is dream … I’m young 23 and yet so broken .. with no support no family no friends . Today’s totally going to be a shit day …

Anxiety,My old counselor threw out my records,"I'm trying to apply for disability. I've been depressed my entire life and unable to hold down a job because of it for the last four. I'm currently wait listed for a new therapist (six month wait!!) I need records from my old counselor to give to my new one (whenever I get assigned one) and to establish that I've been getting treatment so I called her. Two days go by so I call her again. A new receptionist picks up (she never had one before) and says ""oh yeah we don't have your records."" I say why and she says ""we only keep them for seven years."" It's one MONTH into SIX years since I last saw her. I started going to her in 2016. MAYBE late 2015. So she threw out my records one year early. And on top of that she didn't even have the decency to call me back. I left her a voicemail the first time and when I called today I get some random girl saying ""she wanted me to tell you."" This is the same counselor who dumped me with ""I can't see you anymore"" without giving any alternatives for care and made me distrust them so much it's taken me this long to seek help again.

I went to this counselor when I lived in Michigan and I live in Pennsylvania now. I asked the receptionist to have the counselor call me. I feel like that won't happen. Is there anything I can do?

Anxiety,"Wasn’t anxious about bridges, until this morning","I live in Pittsburgh and a bridge I’ve used and that is close to places I frequent weekly just collapsed. It was a MAJOR bridge - it connected two very well populated areas. I cross multiple bridges to get to work everyday, and now every time I have to sit in traffic on one I know I’m going to be terrified. Luckily no one was seriously injured but what if that bridge had gone over a river? Or a highway? Mainly just here to let out my frustration."
Anxiety,My partner's anxiety is getting worse and I don't know how to help.,"So to give some background, my partner has had some form of anxiety all her life, with anticipatory anxiety being the most prevalent. Recently her triggers have been falling asleep and being away from home. She's attending weekly therapy sessions, taking her meds, and doing all the things that have helped in the past; I suppose I can't speak for her entirely, but she seemed to be managing it well despite everything life threw at her. That is, she had been until the new year. 

This last month has been much much harder. We got back from a weeklong trip to visit family over the holidays and only had a few days at work before both testing positive for COVID. Ten days later, and with our routine in pieces, we returned to work, but now she can't make the commute home without panicking. 

As I mainly work from home with flexible hours, she's asked me to escort her home, driving alongside her in separate vehicles. I've indulged her anxiety thus far, but knowing what I do, I feel I can only be making the situation worse. I've been on the phone with her doing guided breathing and grounding techniques (3 things and body scans), but all the tools I know how to use aren't as effective as they once were.

It may be correlation and not causation to assume it's the loss of a routine that has resulted in this drop, but I haven't seen any other change that might have caused this (if anything tangible truly caused this). I'm at a loss of what to do to help, and I feel emotionally drained by the end of the day, which only makes her feel worse about asking me to help.

Any advice or alternative grounding techniques to try would be greatly appreciated. I'm really open to anything at this point."

Anxiety,Yay,"Got yelled at yesterday.. it’s my day off and i can’t even get out of bed now, shaking like a wet dog. Why am i like this 🙃 i know it’s past and pointless now but my anxiety says “yeah no. suffer. now here’s 14 hours of repeated flashbacks of that event”"
Anxiety,My anxiety is at an all time low,"I couldn’t even eat in front of my friends today. I normally have trouble with eating in front of people but I manage to do it. Today I couldn’t. I starved myself because I couldn’t eat in front of people. I don’t get why?? I almost didn’t even go into college because I was anxious about walking into class, because everyone would pay attention to me as I open the door. 

What’s wrong with me?"
Anxiety,Finally seeking out medical help :),"I decided after 3 years of being asked my by doctor if I wanted to, I’m going to ask my new doctor if I can get on medication. I’ve been very scared to ever get on medication but after hearing life-changing stories about it I decided it would be good for myself to do this. 

The problem is i’ve had a new doctor for the past 6 months so I don’t think she knows too much about my mental health situation. She also gets very aggressive so I’m afraid of her saying no or making fun of me.

My childhood doctor always made fun of me as a child when I would tell him symptoms (i didn’t know what an anxiety disorder was) and he would call me “the anxiety girl”.  Hopefully this new doctor is more mature.


Wish me luck !!!!"
Anxiety,Turning down a job because my anxiety won't let me move,"I was offered a job in a city 350 miles away and I have to turn it down because the prospect of moving has me in near constant panic-mode. It sucks. I like the city I live in now, and I could find a similar job here, but the idea that I \*can't\* do this just highlights the limitations anxiety puts on my life and it makes me feel weak and pathetic. It's a six figure job in the biggest research/tech hub in the country. It's kind of like the place to be. The promised land of my career. Where we're all \*supposed\* to aspire to go. If you get a job there you've made it! And I can't do it because of my poor mental health. I feel really, really down on myself. Like I worked 13 years towards this and now I can't go any further. I'm already medicated. I'm already in therapy. I just recovered from a breakdown that required hospitalization about 8 months ago. Maybe it was just too soon? I don't know. This feels like the only chance I'll have to do this and I'm blowing it because separating from the routine I've built over the last 6 months of recovery is sending me spiraling."
Anxiety,dealing with an anxious friend,what’s the best way to deal with an anxious friend? my best friend is very anxious and it means she’s never really up for doing anything new and gets super stressed over tiny things which you really don’t have to worry about!! i understand she can’t help it and i try my best to do what she wants to and support her but it gets really tiring and i feel it holds us both back
Anxiety,Mandatory COVID Booster for College,"19F, 5’2”, 135lbs. I have severe anxiety. If I didn’t have a bad reaction to my first two doses of the Moderna COVID vaccine, I won’t have one with the booster, right? And, the booster probably won’t make me feel even half as bad as the 2nd dose, right? 

I just can’t do it. I’m terrified. I couldn’t go to class today because I made myself sick. Like, I’m absolutely hysterical. I can’t do it. I’m in my dorm room ugly sobbing. I don’t know what to do. Reassure me?"
Anxiety,anyone get those jumpy shoulder things when ur nervous?,
Anxiety,What helps with the physical symptoms of anxiety?,"Muscle tension and feeling jumpy and jittery is perhaps the most debilitating aspect of my anxiety and it really gets in the way of things like job interviews or meeting new people because i'm tense and can barely get a sentence out. If i could relieve these symptoms, things would be a lot easier for me."
Anxiety,Does grocery shopping make your anxiety worse?,"I've gotten to the point where grocery shopping feels like an absolute nightmare, and I just need to know I'm not alone. The 4 things that make it the worst:
1. I'm not great with directions, and I get super anxious if I can’t figure out where an item is in the store.
2. There are two many people and I'm always freaked out that I will be in someone's way or have them get upset at me. 
3. I will literally second guess the items I've put on my list and NOT buy them because I decide ""oh maybe I don't actually need that item"" (spoiler alert: most of the time I actually DID.) 
4. I absolutely HATE driving and I get super anxious doing it--and it's required for me to safely get to a store. 

Can anyone else relate?

Im open to strategies for coping, but my options are rather limited. I used to do grocery pickups/delivery or shop at odd hours, but my current schedule and the place I live make both of those things really challenging."
Anxiety,"I don't know how, but I did it!","Today I had a dentist appointment to fill up a cavity. I was extremely scared, I spent the last two months having panick attacks because of it. I am very scared of pain, and I heard stories of how painful filling up a cavity is because of the drilling.

When I went in today I basically could not even articulate properly. I spent seconds just formulating words and I was completely incapable of calming down. Luckily my dentist is a certified anxiety dentist. So he took the time to listen to me, explained what was gonna happen and went very easy. 

He first numbed my gums with some spray so the anesthesia injection did not hurt. After that he did the injection which indeed did not hurt. I first was scared cuz I still felt everything but after a few minutes my lips felt like botox was put in them and went completely numb. After that the drilling started,  he counted to 5 and then stopped a bit and the he counted to 5 again. So it was all on my own pace.

And much sooner than I expected it was over! I basically felt nothing throughout the whole thing! When I left I felt so good, because for two months I was having panick attack and it was finally over!

I did it!"
Anxiety,Should I be concerned? Heart attack or COVID/Anxiety,"
I am 18f with no known underlying health conditions. I’m also double vaxxed Pfizer with no booster yet. (i actually planned to get it this week but I felt sick so I cancelled it) I was exposed to COVID Saturday, 12/18 and started showing slight symptoms on Monday, 12/20. The symptoms were just a sore throat and slight congestion. Since then, I’ve had no fever or anything just Shortness of breath (not too bad. I can still do my everyday activities), dull chest pain, sneezing, sore throat from coughing and congestion. I still have my smell and kind of my taste. I imagine it’s the congestion that’s affecting that. 

I’m also allergic to my cat so I’m assuming that’s what’s making me sneeze but I’m not entirely sure. 

What I’m concerned about is the SOB and dull chest pain. I have GAD so I’ve been googling and now I’m convinced I’m having a heart attack or I have pneumonia lol. I think my body is mimicking symptoms as a result of my anxiety. I think this because I don’t remember feeling these symptoms until reading about the heart attack symptoms (i might have felt it i just genuinely do not recall). I suddenly started feeling pains in my arms and legs once I read about them. They hurt when resting if that means anything. I am also on the pill if that means anything too. My coughs haven’t really been productive. 

My diet isnt too good either. I don’t drink or smoke often, definitely less than monthly. Please help."
Anxiety,28 yo male. I have very bad anxiety,"I am a 28 year old male and i have very bad anxiety. Since i was a kid i have had anxiety especially around people and leaving my house. When i was a kid i didnt leave my house much. I graduated high school in 2012 and started isolating myself for long periods. Anxiety has prevented me from doing so much in life. I also stay anxious alot and have other fears as well.

Years ago i was diagnosed with a anxiety disorder. I stopped going to the mental health clinic because i could not afford it. I am asking for advice on how to deal with my anxiety without meds or profession help. Also if someone else is dealing with anxiety."
Anxiety,Please help me.,"So I don't actually know if this is anxiety or not but maybe you can help me. I choked on some bacon about a year ago, and ever since then I've had this sense of fear when I'm eating. I always make sure I've got a drink nearby when I'm eating and if it can be helped then I'll avoid eating alone.

That was working fine for me until recently. Now I get the feeling that there's stuff in my throat. It started with this feeling of dread that there was some food in my throat and that I might aspirate so I called a friend and he calmed me down a bit. Now it's gotten so bed that it's 7:00am where I am and I haven't slept yet because I keep compulsively swallowing saliva and thinking that it's going into my lungs instead of my stomach and every time I swallow I have to cough because I'm terrified ill drown in my own saliva. I can't stop thinking about it. All I want to do is sleep and I can't because of this panic and it's making me cry.

Please can someone else tell me they feel the same of have felt the same and that it gets better because I can't deal with it."
Anxiety,Mild but constant intrusive thoughts,"Several months ago I had an event that happens constantly for everyone, but it stuck with me for a while. At first it was all I could think about no matter what I did and would dream about it. I hated the thought of it constantly and tried to drown it out all I could.
After a while I got really good at forgetting about it but no matter what, it would always be back for at least a few minutes every day. It's no longer a pain to think about, but it will make me feel nervous for a while after. I already know it's over and nothing can come back from it, but the same minor feelings keep coming back.
Though it's not severe, and I might even say so minor that just writing this seems like too much for what it is, how can I keep calm? Like I breathe a bit harder and feel a little heavier but I can still function completely fine with my body. Just my thoughts get really clouded for a few hours and I just feel out of it.


Does anyone know how to push the feeling away when I think about it or how to better handle it? Again, it's so minor that I probably shouldn't even be asking but it would just make everything better for me so why not right?


Sorry if I repeated myself or said jibberish. I'm having a hard time passing out so I wrote this hoping somebody knows some trick."

Anxiety,Food sharing anxiety ?,"I can’t find anything on this online. In my past relationship, whenever sharing an appetizer or a meal I’d rush to eat exactly the same thing they did in fear that I wouldn’t get my fair share of the food. For example - if they had a mozzarella stick, I had to. if they had a dumpling, I had to, even if I still had the mozzarella stick still in my mouth. I would rush to eat because I felt like I wouldn’t get enough to eat or that they’d have more than me. I don’t know what this is called and what causes it, but i’ll rush to eat so that I don’t receive less than the other person. Can anyone help? Is this an eating disorder ?"
Anxiety,I really can’t take it anymore,"trigger warning for mentally abusive relationship

this is gonna be a long rant. I made a throwaway account so no one I know could find me, because I don’t want to concern them or get them involved any further. I don’t know where else to turn so I’m here. 

I’m almost 19 years old and for most of my life I’ve suffered with a severe anxiety disorder. about 3 years ago I finally got a diagnosis, but really everyone kinda knew it was a thing. it had always been prevalent, I was always afraid of everything, nervous to try anything, just generally a nervous person. but I got that diagnosis through a therapy program that was somewhat connected to my school. ever since then, it’s only just given a name to what I feel. 

I was in a relationship for almost two years ending in the summer of 2019. she emotionally abused me and manipulated me into believing that I was pretty much never good enough. everything was my fault, I didn’t feel safe talking about things I’d like cause she’d either get mad at me for it or make fun of me because of it. she constantly made me believe I wasn’t good enough, and the thought of her breaking up with me was a looming threat for 10 months until she finally did. don’t get me wrong, I did make my fair share of mistakes, I wasn’t infallible, but she found that when I made a mistake I would do anything to correct it and do anything to make it right. so she abused that. she made me fear doing anything that wasn’t just following a kind of strict set of guidelines. I couldn’t express myself, I didn’t feel free to be me at all, and I just kept going because I didn’t want to break up with her to 1. hurt her, or 2. be out of a relationship. it took me almost two years to realize that that relationship traumatized me. 

since then and even during I have seen about 5 or 6 different therapists that I only saw once for each therapist. it kept not working for one reason or another, so I gave up in trying to see a therapist. I still really want to. I need to. 

last year I was given alprazolam for panic attacks because they became incredibly frequent. that didn’t do much. earlier this year I was given citalopram but it didn’t help much. they upped my dosage recently and it’s been helping a small amount I suppose, but not really much. 

the good news is I recently entered into another relationship, but quickly realized that trauma is still there. I’m stressed all the time that I’m doing something wrong or she’s not gonna like me for one reason or another, while also being stressed about things that in my mind I can’t even reason with myself as to why they stress me out. it’s gotten even worse lately, I feel like vomiting all the time and I’m sleeping so much to just get that respite away from the stress. I can’t function as a normal human anymore, nothing makes me happy. I don’t feel healed or helped ever. and now I’m stuck, and we’re all caught up to speed as to why I’m here today. 

I have plenty of supporters in my life, but it’s just not fair for me to share this burden with them. it’s day in and day out, so stressed I feel like I’m gonna vomit all the time, and not being able to be the kind of friend or partner I should be because of this. and the worst part is that nothing helps. I feel awful that I can’t share this with anyone because I want that help so bad, but it’s really really unfair to do that. no one should have to suffer through this, and when people tell me they still want to know when I’m stressed I can’t in my right mind tell them, it’s not fair to them, they don’t deserve to also have to feel this. I don’t wish this on anyone, this is the worse I’ve ever felt. I just want to feel some semblance of normal and I want to be a good partner for my girlfriend. frankly I love her and I don’t want her to be hurt ever, she’s made it clear that she wants me to tell her when I’m feeling bad or stressed because she knows of this past relationship and of my anxiety, but I just can’t reasonably tell her that I’m feeling bad when it’s every single day. it’s not fair to her, she doesn’t deserve that. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, I don’t know where to turn."
Anxiety,Scared of developing more,"I have no idea why but this entire day, ive been extremely extremely anxious. I was at one point worried that i was going to end up believing in a crazy theory and end up becoming a crazy conspiracy person or develop schizophrenia, even though i knew that i didn’t believe the theory. Then as I was watching a show, i wondered what people that have voices in their heads hear and then i started to worry about “what if i have voices in my head and dont know it?” And then my brain started to kind of try and make them up, which was severely anxiety inducing. For some reason, my brain KEEPS trying to do it and its making it so much scarier and even though i know it is just my brain doing it, i can tell i keep wanting to question myself about it. It kind of circles back to the “what if i develop schizophrenia” idea. Overall, its just been kind of hanging over my head and i kind of need some advice to just kind of get me off that idea because it’s bothering me wayy too much and i am so scared of it."

Anxiety,What advice would you have for someone who has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since the pandemic began in early 2020?,"So long story short, my life was just starting to take hold in 2019, i was in college, had friends, was dating for the first time really, and my life was JUST starting to open up. literally right at that exact moment that I'm starting to do well, this random once in a 100 year pandemic happens and my college has remote learning for 2 straight years. for 2 years i \*literally sat in complete isolation doing 10+ hours a day of homework and stressful exams, barely ever left the house besides to get fast food and alcohol, and drank and stared at a wall.\* My professors went HARDER on me with work than before the pandemic, and i begged them for a break but didn't get any mercy. Literally ""I understand how you're feeling, but there will be no exceptions."" My sleep suffered, i was basically sleep deprived for 2 years (still am). I feel like I now know what prison is like. So anyway, i just pushed through it as best I can, and graduated. Now I'm just at home trying to recover mentally from all this. Im a little better without this degree of stress, but i still have anxiety and depression pretty bad. I just want a normal life. This pandemic or whatever it's called literally ruined my life. That's all."
Anxiety,Panick attacks,"I'm just having a lot of anxiety about Covid.

My grandparents are in assisted living care and so I am worried that they got Covid as well. Im not sure if they are getting tested or when they are but I'm having anxiety thinking about if they have Covid and if they did have Covid what if they passed away. I hate anxiety. I was just sitting in the bathroom balling having a panic attack. I just need some support."
Anxiety,My anxiety on the world ending,"I have major anxiety with thinking about the world ending, mainly an asteroid hitting earth. I’ve been like this since I was 11 and would stay up for hours looking out the window to make sure nothing was happening. I still do this, but not as much as I used to. Now I’ll just look up articles about asteroids and if there’s any coming close to earth or anything. I don’t know why I think about this so much. I really wish I didn’t because it affects me so bad to the point where I’m throwing up because of all the anxiety that’s built up thinking about it. It ruins my day and I feel bad for my fiancé who has to deal with it. He always comforts me though, but because I’m like this a lot of the time I just feel so bad and I don’t know what to do anymore to get this stuff out of my head."
Anxiety,TRYING TO LEAVE BUT CAN’T,"Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my first real post on this app. I have been on here a while and always looked at things but never actually had the balls to post something so here I go:

Okay so back story me (M23) and my girlfriend (F24)have been off and on for about 2-2.5 years. When we first started dating things were going amazing bc of the honeymoon phase or whatever. But I was genuinely super happy and excited to see her all the time. But then slowly things started changing as we grew out of it. And they definitely changed for the worse. Like she would always pick fights with me or say some pretty out of pocket things that would be rude and piss me off. Which would then cause us to get into extremely heated arguments. She would also get mad when I would share my opinion about something that she felt strongly about.

(Ex. She told me she wouldn’t get married without signing a prenup and got mad when I said she has nothing of value anyone would want to take)

As time passed we started hitting one roadblock after the other and itches relationship started getting extremely toxic. The biggest issue being our families religious differences. Her family being strict and devout Muslims and mine being semi devout Hindus. Her parents will never accept me for who I am and I know that even if my parents accept her my extended family will never. She always says she doesn’t care about her relationship with her family and that if I really cared about her I would stand up for her. (Doesn’t quite work like that in my household)

Knowing this we have still been together for about two years now and it’s coming to that point where I need to either break it off with her or make a decision that will break apart my family. The biggest issue is no matter what I decide, my anxiety level goes through the f**king roof every time and I end up back in the same place I started. This also explains the constant breaking up and going on breaks throughout our relationship.

Recently, today actually, she texted me that she wants to break up out of no where because I didn’t answer her phone while I was working. Just trying to reemphasize how toxic this relationship is but for some reason I can’t let her go. I just need some advice guys I really want to move on but the thought of her with someone else just elevates my anxiety to a new high. I know this isn’t a dating forum but I just need help on how to cope with my anxiety and also if anyone wants to offer relationship advice as well that would be great.

Thanks people of Reddit :/

Anxiety,Kinda just a rant...,"Recently I cut off most of my friends. We all had substance abuse issues so it was necessary. I've been getting my feeling/emotions back the past few months of sobriety. I get this feeling in my chest of sadness or anxiety, and it is weirdly nostolgic. I remember feeling like this when I was a kid. I just remember getting mad at myself for feeling it. To this day when I get it, I never know why I feel this way. Just makes me want to cry. Am I alone? Has anyone else had these moments?"

Anxiety,Patronising colleague + manager,"We handle production issues on our days off (the Xmas break just gone) and I had let my senior colleague know that I’ll be off for a few hours so won’t be able to handle any issues IF they do arise and sorted out cover with someone else wayyy before this. He didn’t take this well for some reason, got super pissed over message and called me uncommitted and basically made a big deal about it as if he was my manager!! Very patronising. I’m the type to take things to heart especially for my job cuz I want to do well and get promoted (long overdue for one I’ve been told by others). And to make things worse, my manager has itty bitty issues with me I.e. taking an hour here and there off to sort my anxiety / physical medical issues out. Which also stresses me out. 

Clocking on in 1hr and will have to face my senior colleague and my manager (senior has defo snitched to my manager about the above even tho nothing bad happened with our production issues and my other nicer colleague covered my few hours off). 

Feeling anxious, gonna throw up and feeling so worthless right now. 

Any support or advice if you’ve gone through similar would be appreciated."
Anxiety,Not sure why I’m anxious but I feel like something bad is going to happen,"I’m having intrusive thoughts, which I can usually manage, but today I have a feeling of dread on top of it. I take Buspirone which helps a lot, so I’m wondering what the hell is wrong. My fear is centered around something bad happening to myself or loved ones, particularly health related (someone getting cancer or having an accident) - so I’m sitting here wondering if someone close to me is about to get hurt and I can “feel it coming”. This shit sucks. 

I’m 5 months postpartum so I’m wondering if it’s hormonal, is it pms coming back? I drank a few beers yesterday, is it a mini-hangover?

Anxiety,Overthinking Anxiety Will Make You Do These 8 Things (And You Won’t Even Realize),[removed]
Anxiety,"Just started birth control, can’t stop worrying about the side effects","I was prescribed birth control because of some cysts in my ovaries, and I started taking it three days ago. I read somewhere that taking birth control can increase your risk of a blood clot, especially one that travels to the lungs. Ever since yesterday I’ve had a tight feeling in my chest and throat and it feels difficult to breath.

For context, I have a history of hypochondria related anxiety. I’m almost certain this is a panic attack, especially since it goes up and down depending on whether I’m thinking of it. And it feels like panic attacks I’ve had before.

but gosh, my brain is so good at convincing me that “this time it’s different”, and “this time I’m gonna die.” Plus, the symptoms of a blood clot in the lungs are said to feel like a panic attack!

i’m not sure what I need or what I can do. I’m just very much panicking right now and would appreciate support."
Anxiety,"Constant chest tight, but when im at work I dont notice it","Have it worse or lighter. But it is here everyday for 5 months. I have general amxiety. Also cant sleep for 11 days, pain in left arm and thyroid is enlarged. But when im at job i dont think about it. I work at market.."
Anxiety,I feel like my anxiety has anxieties,"Pretty dumb title but hear me out.

A little backstory. I used to have really bad anxiety going outside a couple years ago. Then I went to therapy. My therapist tried all sorts of things on me, most of them didn't work, but somehow breathing excercises did. I made a lot of progress in a couple of months. My anxiety almost entirely disappeared, but I was still feeling the lingering nervousness pretty much constantly. It wasn't anxiety though.

Then March of this year I caught COVID, I had to be quarantined for a month. My breathing suffered from it, so did the breathing excercises. Every morning I woke up breathing heavily for half a year. Then my hair started falling out really quickly, which made me even more anxious about my health. One of the main symptoms I always feel when I'm anxious is massive pain in my stomach, this started to appear again after many years. Because of the lack of oxygen my mental and physical health started to get worse. 

 I realized that now I'm anxious BEFORE I'm having anxiety. I have trouble going outside, I'm in pain when I'm preparing myself to go and when I do, I almost always have to run to the nearest bathroom. Eating out is pretty much always off the table now. Even getting groceries fills me with anxiety most of the time. Not to mention going to job interviews or exams at my university.

But now I got to the point that I don't even need to go outside anymore to get anxious and stressed. The lingering feeling became worse, the stomach pains are now constant and I'm always nauseous . Even laying on my bed alone makes me feel like I'm in the most stressful situation ever. I have trouble sleeping alone, I always wake up in cold sweat. Because of this I'm always tired and depressed.

Sorry, just wanted to vent somewhere."

Anxiety,Constant adrenaline in chest,"I've been doing research and haven't found exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm wondering if anyone else feels the way I do. Kind of like hearing really bad news, or waiting to hear bad news, but for days at a time. Like a sinking heart breaking feeling even though things in my life are pretty content. Lately it hasn't been that bad for me since I've been taking prozac and buspar, but tonight I'm getting some lingering feelings of dread and heartbreak and I'm not sure why. Does anyone get this for days at a time too or is this something physical I need to check out? 

I have absolutely nothing to be sad or anxious about, by the way."
Anxiety,Constant sleepiness,I’ve been going through court the past year over my kids and I’ve been very depressed and anxious over it and it causes me to be very sleepy during the day and especially when I’m home from work it seems like all I want to ever do is sleep and I don’t feel like doing anything else I can’t even lay down and watch a movie without going to sleep. Anyone else experience this? when will it clear up and when will I start feeling like doing other things and enjoying life again? My court case should be cleared up in a month so I’m hoping that will fix it.
Anxiety,Venus Retrograde,I recently dyed my hair during the venus retrograde and the people around me keeps on saying things like “why did i do it” and stuff. Now it’s giving me extreme anxiety.

Anxiety,"Leg pain, tingling, spasms:(","Hi! Anyone experienced very intense leg, calf pain due to anxiety? I even have tingling sensation, and a little numbness in my foot fingers :( I’m so worry, but I barely can feel it while I’m busy and walking etc. I feel it mostly when I’m focused on that or lying in bed that’s the worst!

Anxiety,Tired (just getting things off my chest),"19 m, im a college student (semester 3) and im struggling with all the assignment. Final exam is also near, right now i have a lot of assignment to do, but i cant do it because i cant focus and im dumb, all the thing that i could think of is that, im afraid im gonna be a failure for my mother and im just afraid man, my mother has done so much thing for me, so i dont want to be a failure to my mother, and lately ive started to cry a lot and i even lost my appetite, im just scared of the future and my anxiety just gotten a lot worse ever since my lecturer start to give out assignment. I just cant stop overthinking about everything, what if i failed, can i even get a job in the future, just everything that is negative and i hate it, and Im sorry if my english is bad"
Anxiety,"I found a fix, but I don't know for how long","I was prescribed ativan and I actually feel normal again for once. My OCD and anxiety isn't controlling my thoughts right now and I can just relax and be myself. This is actually incredible, I never thought I would feel this way again. The only problem is that I've heard you aren't supposed to be on Ativan for long periods of time, so am I just fucked again when I run out or that time is up? Is my only fix in years just a temporary one?"
Anxiety,Anxiety Dream,"Over the last year my anxiety has just been getting worse and worse. Lately I’ve been having anxiety dreams and the last one I  had was kind of traumatizing. I’m in the shower and start having a panic attack. I lay down and just start balling my eyes out, And get the most real and intense feeling of complete hopelessness. Like I will never be happy or fine, and I come to the conclusion that there really is no point of living if I have to suffer through this my whole life. I woke up after that but that’s honestly how I actually feel. I think it came out in my dream because in real life I have a wall up that I use to avoid confronting everything wrong with me. I’m going to seek help still, but if I can’t find relief then idk that I can continue on."
Anxiety,Baseline anxiety has skyrocketed over the last several months. Unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night...,"Hello hello-

I'm going through a a really rough phase of anxiety/insomnia right now and I'm losing my mind. I've been trying melatonin, L-theanine, magnesium, and even benadryl with no luck. I can't sleep through the night! For a while I was unable to fall asleep until around 4am. Now I'm falling asleep fine, but waking up after a couple of hours, which almost always means I can't fall back asleep. 

I rarely take my phone to bed, I put it in airplane mode across the room most nights. I have tried apps like Calm and Headspace and they don't really do much for me.

I just booked an appointment with a therapist, so hopefully I can work through some of this. But holy hell I am so sick of lying in bed for hours, every single night.

Do you all have any suggestions?"
Anxiety,I want to quit my job in 6 months,"I've suffered from anxiety all my life . I am tired. I am so so tired.

I have a good job, and I'm considering resigning to get a job in retail, my thinking behind it is this -

I worked in both Sainsburys and Comet and I don't remember being anxious, you just got on with your job, the small talk isn't as much and its not necessary 

I've tried working in an office  in 5 different teams, and have always felt uncomfortable, most recently I left my job that I'd been in for 4 years - I was so unhappy and anxious for 5 years, i thought by forcing my self to stay I would adapt - I didn't by the end of it every day was torture. I'm in a new time and same thing is happening, I already feel anxious around several colleagues, who won't shut up. I've tried this for almost 10 years, it ain't working

I just want peace, I think working in retail will give it as I have no issues speaking to strangers its just with people I see often 

I thought give it 6 months and if im not happy find a job in retail, part time at the same time I'd be losing a good job but it's been 10 years of misery, my partner is really supportive and will support whatever I do"
Anxiety,Weird “shifting” feeling in chest,"I don’t know if anyone has experienced this. 

Basically I had a really stressful period in October-November where I had really high panic and anxiety every day. I was anxious about a trip and eventually decided to cancel, and as soon as I did so, I settled down a lot. A lot of my panic symptoms have gone away and I feel more physically relaxed. But I’ve been suffering from the symptoms of the anxiety “come-down” for about a month since. 

The main new symptom is like this “shifting” feeling which makes me feel like something is moving in my chest. It lasts for like a second and comes on randomly, but more often when I’m relaxed. It feels a bit like when you first get panicked (heart skipping a beat) but a lot slower and not as startling. I feel fine otherwise and nothing hurts and my breathing is normal. It’s not uncomfortable in any way either, but just weird and a lot different to what I’m used to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if this was a symptom of my body adjusting to a lower stress mode. 

It’s almost like my body is trying to panic and pump adrenaline around but it’s forgotten that there isn’t as much there right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this? I’m getting it less often now (maybe notice it once a day rather than a few times) but I wanted to know if it’s a bad or a good thing. Do I need to just wait for everything to sort itself out on its own?"
Anxiety,Constant chest tightness. When I'm at work I don't notice it. Does anyone feel this?,"Have it worse or lighter. But it is here everyday for 5 months. I have general amxiety.

Anxiety,My Anxiety Quiz,"So I got inspired from a scene of a drama to come up with this. Personally I like visual, imaginative examples to reflect on things and helps me to reflect better. I want to add that I am just another person that suffers from anxiety and in no way of a professional so take it with a grain of salt.

 The purpose of this quiz to understand what thought process is causing you to feel anxious and generally reflect on your reaction towards to an anxiety cause. This is mostly targeted for generalized anxiety disorder. This quiz also has no answers, the answers you give to the questions are supposed to  help you understand something about yourself.

Imagine yourself as a kid. You are walking on a road with your parents and as you are walking you are aging. Now that you've reached to an age where you can make your own decisions, your parents leave you to a place with bars that reach to sky. Now nobody knows where this bar sequence goes to but on your way your parents tell you it's a journey you have to take by yourself to reach to a beautiful place and you have to go there. They leave you after you reach the first bar. It goes like this, some bars are short, some bars are long, some are dirty, some are cold, some are burningly hot, some are slippery as goes on, there are numerous issues that you will have to bear along the way. These bars are only in one line so it's not like you have an option to choose which bar you will climb. After you climb one bar there's this little waiting area that is filled with rewards like food, jewelry etc, things that you need. Sometimes you can't see any rewards sometimes the reward is seemingly bad. You can also see other kids started to climb the bars.

Now each bar represents a situation, an event, an action and the sequence of these lines make your life road, I want you to focus on situations where you struggle mostly. Each reward is a reward that you get from a situation, an event and an action. Sometimes it is an emotional lesson you learn sometimes it is a change of perspective, sometimes you get something bitter at the end so these are rewards that aren't seen but you earn after climbing the bar. And sometimes the rewards are material things that you earn. Before climbing the bar sometimes you can see these rewards and sometimes you can. Each issue with the bar represents a problem which we all go through throughout our life journey. Sometimes you fall because of these issues and hurt yourself and sometimes you easily go all the way up. You see your friend Billy from far climbing his own bar and he seems like he is doing well. When he falls he gets angry but keeps climbing anyways and he seems like he is looking forward to earn all the rewards. Sometimes he hurts himself but he isn't hesitant, he is determined to reach the end.

Now answer these questions. You can also come up with your own questions and ask yourself how do you feel about it.

How's the weather like?

What do you think of the destination?

Do you ever fear climbing a bar? If so what are your fear? Does it prevent you from climbing the bar altogether?

How long do you wait in the waiting area?

What do you think of Billy? Do you think he is having a harder or an easier time? If so do you think it affects you in anyway?

What do you think of the bars? Do you think it is targeting you for something?

What do you think of yourself while climbing these bars?

If you slip 3 times and fall 3 times on a long bar how will you react?

If you climb 3 bars in sequence and while climbing them each time something unexpected happens and you almost fall how do you react? 

Now answer these questions really imagining how would you react in such a situation. And after answering all of them review your answer and reflect how do you react to situations and how situations make you feel. Did it help you understand something about yourself? Let me know.

Note: English is not my first language so if I have mistakes in my writing I'm sorry about it."
Anxiety,Do you fear dying?,
Anxiety,Parents arguing,"So I know I’m 28 but I still live at home and I still worry when my parents argue.

They have always argued since I can remember. When they’re good they are the best duo! They have been through so much together and been together for 40+ years but when they argue…they argue. It’s draining.

My mum atm is going through a stage where she’s is extra angry at my dad for literally everything and more. My dad on the other hand is very sensitive.. too sensitive and my mum can be too harsh.

I don’t want them to argue but most importantly I wish I didn’t care so much. It reminds me of that horrible feeling when I was child and I feared that they’ll divorce. I don’t think they would but I still worry so much! 


Not sure if my mum is more angry atm as she had cancer few years ago and I feel like all her post cancer anger is coming out now.

They’re both such amazing parents… I feel so stupid for even moaning but I worry! Does anyone feel the same when their parents argue as an adult?"

Anxiety,How do you feel your heart with anxiety,"Many people experience heart palpitations along with anxiety. Anxiety sets off the body's “fight or flight” response as part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). When you feel uneasy about a situation, your ANS kicks in, increasing your heart rate.

With anxiety, we can **experience acute attacks or become stuck in** this response, which can lead to persistent heart palpitations.

I often feel small ""stings"" in my heart which cause me to feel scared af. I feel this is changing the person I am...does anyone feel like this?"
Anxiety,Persistent shortness of breath.,"Hello. I’ve had shortness of breath for over four years now and I still don’t know for sure what could be causing it and Im having trouble getting anyone to take me seriously and at least look into it further,even for peace of mind at least. I’m just shrugged off it seems and I’ve become increasingly worried because it’s gotten worse the last few months. 
The only possible cause I’ve been told is anxiety which I do suffer from and have done since around 2014,but I refuse to believe shortness of breath caused by anxiety can be this severe and persistent? I used to suffer from frequent panic attacks in the past but this seems different,unless I’ve been stuck in a constant state of panic for these past 4 years if that’s even possible? and how they can shrug it off as such when the only testing I’ve had since this all started is a couple of ECGs and one chest X-ray which came back clear at the time.

The shortness of breath is pretty much an everyday thing and it comes and goes in waves throughout the day that last minutes to hours. 
When this is happening It feels like I’m suffocating to death and I’m just not getting the air I need so Im always taking deep breaths in like I’m hungry for it. 
It happens mainly at rest,exertion doesn’t really trigger it or make it any worse,although I live a pretty sedentary existence right now and have done for sometime because of my mental health so it’s only really light exertion I’m doing anyway.
I’m constantly having to sit up and lean forward to take breaths because it opens up my lungs abit more. My chest feels congested and heavy as if there’s a bowling ball wedged In it and the more I try and breath the heavier it gets, and the heavier my chest gets the worse the shortness of breath becomes. 
My heart rate is also up and down quite a lot when I’m having these waves of shortness of breath and I sometimes sweat and shake a little,like I would when having a panic attack but I’m not particularly anxious most of the time, in fact I’m pretty calm and I just sit with it. There have been a few times where it’s gotten bad enough and I’ve taken myself to the ER but after a quick ECG I’m sent on my way and told to follow up with my doc which I have done. 

Could this really be sob caused by anxiety? Is anyone else here experiencing the same thing? it really bothers me but as I said I’m just being shrugged off and it’s frustrating. Thanks!"

Anxiety,"I gave an interview to the local news channel, what was I thinking?! I'm so embarrassed...","It's a small segment where they ask for people's opinions on stuff and then show it on the evening news. At the time I thought *cool, I'm going to put myself out there*. Yeah, not so cool now. I think I was slouching, didn't know where to look so kept glancing between the interviewer and camera, said the wrong things and used a lot of filler words like 'uhm' and 'well'. I hesitated even when they asked if I'm a student. *I know I'm a student why did I need to think about it before giving an answer!*

Anyway airtime is in 2 hours, I'm praying they discard my interview and show normal people instead."
Anxiety,My mother is the reason for my anxiety,"When i was young my mther always keeps saying that i have a responsibility for my family since I was the oldest among my siblings, so i need to finish my study and find a job,and thats what she keep reminding me every year or everyday, that i become anxious over my future, i became scared of my responsibility, and i didnt want to bear the responsibility that i know i cant take it, but I dont have any choice since they gave me a good life and its my turn to return the favor 

But i cant even do what i like, i cant even enjoy just like the other teenager because I was anxious over my future that i shut down my self from the society, i just go with the flow but the truth is Im not happy

I cant tell it to my parents, because i know that they would scold me, im fighting all alone, without any help

It feels like a chain the forbid me to fly, 

I was want to be happy and be selfish to think not for my family but for myself, but i cant

Anxiety,Father is retiring and I don't make enough money to stay alive,"Before anything, I have pretty severe anxiety which often times makes me physically sick. 

Exactly what the title said, my father is retiring in about 1.5 years and I don't make enough money to support myself. I'm 23 and have an associates in biology if that means anything.

I work full time at $16.90/hr and go to college part time.

I support myself, other than the high rent in our area.

I got this news because he asked me to help calm my mother down (they don't have a house built yet to live in once he retires and that will be on the property they own 4.5 hours away). She doesn't want to leave me/the area that we live in. However he was the breadwinner and we don't make enough money to cover rent in this area.

I think I'm going to have to drop out in order to be able to afford rent. But how can I do that when most rent in this area is more than I make a month? Even with roommates it would eat 1/2 of my paycheck. 

I can't stop thinking about it, my anxiety is making my physically sick again. I was supposed to go to the doctors but I don't know if I can afford that now. I have no skills that are worth a high pay, and honestly I'm not very good at anything other than being a reliable employee.

I'm panicking and I don't see a way out. Probably going to delete later but any advice or comments would be appreciated. Please be nice."

Anxiety,Feeling sick out of nowhere,"Wondering if anyone else feels this way.
I'm at a point where my anxieties are very under control, id say I'm usually at a 7-9 out of 10. 

However suddenly I'll start having the feeling of fever, stomach pains and general discomfort. All seemingly out of nowhere, without having something noticable triggering it. This usually lasts one or several days and makes me believe I'm about to die, or at least starting to be sick.

It bothers me since I otherwise seem to feel quite decent and understand what my triggers are and what to avoid.
I am dealing with health related anxiety, not wanting to be sick in general and absolutely terrified of vomiting etc.. 

Currently on my 2 day of feeling not great and was wondering if anyone ever get the same feeling and can relate?
What do you do to feel better and do you know what may trigger it in the first place?"
Anxiety,Extremely scared of COVID-19 spread and recent potential exposure at a testing site,"Because my anxiety would not let me calm down about a recent trip I made last Saturday, I decided to get a test done in my local testing site for Covid. When I get there, there’s not too many people, and everyone who was unmasked there (I live in a more conservative area) was given a mask. In order to get the results of a rapid test, the testing center allowed people to wait outside for their results, and only let 5 people in at a time.

There was a lady at the clinic who left the testing site as I came in; while I was filling out the forms, she came next to me to check her rapid test results and I glanced over for which it said positive. She quickly left but I was “exposed” to her and maybe others in that office. Worst part was that I didn’t even properly fill out my form so my test results won’t even come in.

I’m really angry at myself that I unnecessarily exposed myself to Covid while at this clinic. Right now I’m alone in my city because I have to work and all my connections are out of town; if I get Covid I could be starting the new year with it and I really don’t want to do that.

I hate that my anxiety induced me to get even more exposed to COVID when I’m already afraid of it. I’ve been in extreme panic since going to this testing center even though I was double masked there and it just sucks that my anxiety made it worse."
Anxiety,Too afraid to face my social phobia,"Hi. I'm 24M. 

I've always had problems talking to people, let's say, ""without reasons"". If i ""need"" to talk, even with a stranger, there's no problems. I go to the gym and have started taking cooking class, and i really have issues. But when it's small, meaningless talk, my head becomes empty, i can't think of anything. Even halfway trhought conversation i struggle to find words. "" What do i even say ? How do i respond to that ?"". As i was a shy, akward kid, i don't have stories to share. I feel like as a result, I can't engage or connect with others. I've had a couple of friends in school, but i lost contact with them. 

I've always wanted to be more social, to go to events, to make friends. But most of my attemps ended up as failures.
When i tried to go to parties and bars when i was a student, i just had panicks attacks, and either frooze or left. When i tried to date, i only got rejected. 

Now, i don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have no ideas how to talk to strangers and the simple thought accelerates my heart rate. And now i don't know what to do anymore"
Anxiety,why do i always feel like i’ll never enjoy my hobbies?,"before i begin doing any of my hobbies, my brain just tells myself i don’t actually enjoy them and i’m just faking it/being an imposter. once i start them, i do enjoy them, but it’s a battle to not let my anxiety or depression take over and just make me feel like i’m a fake. i want to read today, and i’m going to, but goddamn it scares me.

Anxiety,I’m 22 and too anxious to ask my probably controlling parents if I can visit a friend 20 min away,"They don’t even let me leave the house without permission, they’ve got motion sensor cameras and they never say no usually but just make everything feel like an interrogation and huge effort for them.

I’ve been trying to work up the courage for 3 weeks now to ask if I can go to my friend but secretly my boyfriends house (as they don’t let me catch ubers unless it suits them or buses and I don’t drive). Feel sick everytime I try and before that I had two other friends who lived in the same suburb that I’ve never been able to visit.

Would gladly appreciate some advice on this"
Anxiety,Just tested positive for Covid this morning and I’m freaking out,"Rationally I know I’m going to be okay. I’m 28, triple vaccinated, and relatively healthy. But my anxiety is off the freaking handle, I’m barely keeping it together.

After 2 years of not seeing family we decided to come visit and stay with my in-laws. On Christmas Eve we were exposed to Covid. I’ve been freaking out this entire time worried sick that I will be unwell away from home and trapped up here.

Yesterday my father-in-law tested positive and my mother-in-law has been feeling horrible. The plan was this morning we were going to test and if they were negative, drive back home. But I finally tested positive this morning.

My anxiety is through the fucking roof. This was exactly why I was afraid to travel and this was exactly my worse case scenario. I’m so scared."
Anxiety,I'm scared of what I'll do if there is another lockdown.,"Like many, I was deeply depressed and anxious during the lockdowns. I was mistreated by my family. I felt trapped and isolated. I gained about 30-40 lbs. I nearly cut myself. I banged my head on a table repeatedly. 

My state issued mask mandates and since, my anxiety has skyrocketed. 

I am living alone now in an apartment since the last lockdowns, but my gf is across state lines. If there is a lockdown, I won't be allowed to see her. 

I am angry at the world. I came very close to hurting myself during the last lockdown and I'm scared that I'll be in the same situation again."
Anxiety,How Do You Completely Decompress?,"Been going through a ton the last few months. Relationship stuff. Job stuff. House/home stuff. Holidays. I just have had my mind going a mile a minute and really kicking up those waves of anxiety in a way in which my prescribed drugs (Adderal and Wellbutrin) haven't been completely able to control like they do most days. I really just need at least one day of just like total shut down/relaxed/no thoughts...borderline just apathy... to decompress, let my mind cool down a bit, etc. I am curious about what other people do in these cases. Recreational drugs? Walks? Nothing?"

If I focus really hard and can unclench my jaw but as soon as I break that focus my whole face is tense and I grind my teeth all night (with a guard) and all day and only can seem to catch it when my teeth slide hard enough to make noise. It seems like no matter how mindful I am of my muscles, I can't gain any like habitual or subconscious results. Does anyone else do this and how do you deal? I can't take any medication to help my headaches anymore so it's getting miserable"
Anxiety,Too much free time,"Does anyone get anxious when they have too much free time? Im a 19 year old college student who just had a super long break. During that break I felt so anxious that I had all this time. So anxious that it made me NOT want to go and do things. And even though my parents tell me free time is great, I cant seem to enjoy it. I am already thinking about the summer and what I need to do to fill up my time, but it scares me."
Anxiety,"Had a 3 hour long panic attack last night, and I’m not doing well.","For the record, I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder about 4 years ago, and it’s usually worse during winter.

Last night, I had a really bad panic attack that probably should’ve sent me to the ER. However, my parents would’ve gotten really mad at me if I went, so I decided to tough it out. I’ve never felt that awful before, and every single tip and trick I’ve used over the years couldn’t calm me down—even things that usually work without fail. I was an absolute wreck. I woke up after about 4 hours of sleep and I’m still feeling really anxious and my head hurts, and I don’t know what to do about it. Nobody in my family or any of my friends have anxiety or suffer from anxiety attacks, and I feel really alone and exhausted. I really just need some support right now, because I’m tired of feeling this way."
Anxiety,Diazepam,"My doctor prescribed Diazepam for my anxiety and he said to take it only when I need it.  I am not against medication for anxiety but in my opinion, as long as I am able to handle it,  there is no need for me to take medicines. In fact,  I don't even take pain relivers or anything when I am sick as long as I can handle it,  I just sleep/rest then it will be gone the next day all because I am anxious of the possible side effects of medicines.  

Now, I brought some Diazepam just in case I badly needed it but I am scared to take it. Everytime, I want to take it,  I get so anxious about the side effects because I heard that it can be addictive. I have health anxiety and what I did is I googled the possible side effects of taking it and now I am more scared.  

DAE take Diazepam? What did you feel after taking it?  Did you have any side effects?"
Anxiety,How do you stop stressing about disease and everything else?,"It's hard for me to stay in a good mood when you're worried about everything bad happening.

Anxiety,Why am I always so paranoid?,"For the past week, I've been imagining my parents dying in a car accident, my pet dying, and if they come a bit late, during that time I wonder if they are even alive. How do I get over this? I'm 13."
Anxiety,"Saw an image online, now can’t get my mind off negative associative thoughts","The image I saw was sexual in nature as well
So recently I bought a plushie of a character from my favourite series,  then the next day I was searching it online when I saw a image of it on google, my same plush I bought but with someone’s male sexual fluid on its face. I felt quite sick after seeing it, it made me worry that I’ll see what I bought differently and always think of that image when I look at my plush. It’s been around a week and it’s still lingering in my mind , I’m scared I’ll never be able to look at that character or cartoon in the same way or enjoy it as much.
I keep overthinking about it and how it’ll impact my view on the series going forward.

Is there a way to move past this? I shouldn’t let someone else’s actions impact my own feelings so much but I haven’t been able to fight the overthinking and associations"
Anxiety,Rumination Tips,"Good day everyone, I ruminate. I pray that I will stop obsessing over rubbish one day. Until then, I will continue to put in the work. Intellectually, I know that it is not value-added, but my mind wanders down the crowded path of rumination. Two tips that I have learned: 

(First) 3-3-3 rule has helped (I read about it a few weeks ago on this sub)  

(Second) Distraction through action is what I read about this morning, gardening, exercise, reading a book, \[writing this post --- LOL\]

Have a great day, everyone, stay encouraged. Breathe today! Cheers."

Anxiety,"I don't know what is what anymore. Anxiety, medical issues or hormonal issues?","This is going to be a bit of a long text. Sorry 😅

I've been a member for a few weeks now. And I've been reading along with all of you on this subreddit. Trying to figure out what the hell is going on with me. I'm 37, female. Live in Europe, Holland. 


March 2020 sudden shortness of breath started with frontal rib pain and pressure. Also complete panic and very hard to breathe. Went to the ER, doctors thought it was covid or an allergic reaction. I wasn't tested back then, no pcr tests were available. But It wasn't covid. Months later I didn't show any T-cell response so they told me it can't have been an infection with covid. 
After that moment I lived in utter fear for months. Like a wave of panic and unreal feelings of detachment. I had chestpain, nerve tingles down my arms, headaches, heart rate was higher, neck pains, jaw pains and severe shortness of breath with checking my saturation all the time. Trying to calm me down. It did calm me down in the end. And after awhile the continue checking stopped. 

The pressure on my chest was and is the worst. Had an EKG, bike stress test, pulmonary exam, blood was checked, chest xray. One ER staff member said I was hyperventilating. She could see this in my blood work. So I was sent to do some hyperventilation excersises. Breathing excersises and was sent to a lung physical therapist. It didn't help. Still the panic attacks continued. Sometimes a few times per day. Also started having throat issues. Dry throat and jaw problems. I apparanlty had a gaping hole in my tooth that my dentist did not see somehow and an infection started and I needed a few root canals. After those my jaw has been tight and clicking and popping all day long and I was told it might be tmd. Will see a gnatologist in Feb. 

Then in Sept last year I was diagnosed with severe endometriosis. And last Nov 30th I had my endometriosis lap. After this lap and 3 days in hospital (I had general anesthesia and was very sick afterwards) I felt okay for a few days. But then the throat tightness, itchyness in the throat and extremely tight painful jaw muscles and tight chin muscles came on. And haven't left me. Because it feels like someone is choking me I inhale deeply at times. Which make the chest symptoms worse. I guess you might call this silent hyperventilation. Idk. I was also diagnosed with costochondritis by my physical therapist and now swelling on my upper sternum is visible. He now says it's called tietze syndrome. The swelling makes it hard to breathe for me. And the throat is def tighter when it's swolen.

I've had a few intense panic attacks after my surgery. And I feel on edge and anxious the entire time without a reason. The surgery messed with my hormones. And I started hormonal therapy, desogestrel mini pill 3 months ago. I spoke to my gynaecologist and he mentioned these feelings could be from the hormonal pill and wanted me to stop it.

So I did. And the unreal feeling, like living in a movie where my house is not my house dissappeared completely. I am still very anxious and on edge and restless but it's different. I'm not floating anymore. 

I also haven't been sleeping well since surgery. And noticing on the nights I do sleep well I feel a lot better the next day. But still.. I feel depressed, mildly, and find it very hard to enjoy life and the things that brought me joy I try to avoid. Because I can't focus on anything else then those imaginary hands that are choking me. 

I have a tight feeling in my throat 24/7. Gp is sending me to an ENT specialst. But also mentioned this could be jaw related. Or maybe from intubation from surgery.

I feel that I am anxious because my throat is tight. And if this feeling would dissappear I will be able to calm down again. But then again.. I wonder if ALL of this is anxiety related.

It's so so strange that these symptoms all of a sudden appeared one day in March 2020. While before I never had anxiety. I've been in chronic pain the last 6 years, leg pain nerve pain, stomach pain.. Because I didn't know I had endometriosis. So I've been on high alert (and long time painmeds such as ibuprofen) for years. But there wasn't any anxiety.

I'm trying to figure out what part is anxiety and what part is actually my body not being okay. I developed some health anxiety I think. But I've had a lot of diagnoses I wasn't expecting. (severe endometriosis and adenomyosis, tietze syndrome, sciatica, piriformis syndrome, TMD, epilepsy and lipedema,) I suffer asthma and severe allergies for over 30 years now as well. And I've developed new allergies recently and that's also given me high anxiety. I've had adrenaline shots for this last month. Since the feeling of throat closing worsened. But no one can know for sure if that wasn't ""just anxiety"". 

I've had a sleep ecg and my epilepsy is still there. While I hoped it would be gone. Since I haven't had a seizure in a while. Which brings on more anxiety. But also have to take more meds because of that. Which have side affects that can cause anxiety. And epilepsy itself gives you a sensitive nervous system)

I have no idea anymore what what is. I feel tight chested and tight throat even though I ""think"" I'm not anxious at that time. Its just there the entire time.
How am I able to figure out where anxiety stops and medical issues begin?
It's haunting me the entire day. And affecting my life.
I've been chronically ill my entire life and have dealt pretty fine with that. Or have I? 

But feeling on high alert all day long and these throat symptoms that get me on edge is depressing.
Doctors look at me funny nowadays. I'm seeing a rheumatologist soon since an orthopedic surgeon I saw for my shoulder pain suspects fybromyalgia or rheumatoid artritis. I mean... It's a lot to take in.

My psychologist doesn't really know what to do or say. So I'm kinda at my wits end. And want to feel comfortable and without any physical symptoms again.

Does anyone have any tips, tricks, ideas of what I should and should t do? Or someone with the same symptoms?"

she said when I asked the reasons was because I did not ask her any questions on the first date-I do suffer from severe social anxiety and at time I could not maintain eye contact I was really nervous and felt bad about it later on. She said I seemed disinterested and she left feeling horrible and drained having to fill every awkward silence

we texted in between all seemed good we had another call I tend to have a monotone/flatline voice which she noted came across as disinterest

2nd date-I was also a bit nervous and holding back I find it hard to feel comfortable around people and she told me this after she ghosted me that she knew I was holding back

she genuinely seems like a lovely girl she did try really hard to ease make me comfortable on the 1st date

Anxiety,Anxiety gets worse and worse,I had a panic attack a couple days ago and since then it’s all I can think about. I wake up with anxiety that gets worse and worse until eventually at night it will get is bad I’ll start panicking. This has been the case the last few days and I just can’t eat and feel nauseous.
Anxiety,Dealing with loneliness and anxiety,"I'll try to keep this short, because I see I just want to vent for too long.

I recently started noticing that a lot of my anxiety is triggered by loneliness. Whenever I'm watching people hang out with friends, I will get a lot of anxiety.. I immediately start thinking about how lonely I am, and how I don't see my way out of this. I get triggered by so many things, which somehow bring out loneliness in me.. it can be music, TV shows, listening to people chat on the street, just thinking about the past/future, etc...

Most days, my only social interactions are with my girlfriend. She's a medical resident, so she has crazy schedule somedays, which makes me feel more lonely. I feel like I've developed attachment anxiety towards her.. which I've had in the past for my mom. 

I work from home as the newest member of a small team, where we only have a weekly meeting and the rest of it is mostly individual work. I don't interact with my coworkers most days, unless we're working on something together, but most of the time since I've been here, we haven't.

I have some friends from high school, but they all live 2+ hours away since we've all moved away from our home town. They hang out sometimes since they live in the same city, but I only get to see them about twice a year, when we're all in our home town at the same time. 

In the city I live in, I only know 5 people.. most of them are old coworkers that I stayed in contact with, and we do text occasionally, but that's a few short conversations a few times a week. I try to invite them to hang out from time to time, but I feel like they all have their own friend groups, so they almost never return the invitation. One of them is my old college friend, whom I used to consider my best friend, but since we stopped college, we've only seen each other once a year, and I'm afraid to contact them now, since it's been so long.

I'm not sure what to do. I desperately want to hang out with people more often, but at the same time, I feel like I will still feel the same way after. I've always been a bit of a lone wolf, but recently I've had a harder time being alone, because almost everything I used to do triggers me now.

We've got a puppy recently that I've been taking care of, and I desperately hope to meet other dog owners who will want to hang out with me. I'm considering joining a gym, but I doubt I would meet people there. I've applied for a yoga class, mostly to calm myself down, but secretly hoping I will make some friends there.

I don't know what to do. Should I accept my loneliness and live with it, or can I do something about it? I'm afraid these feeling will come back later in life, and I won't know how to deal with them. I want to start a family with my girlfriend, but I'm afraid our child would not have any friends, since we don't have many."
Anxiety,Covid might not kill me but will my anxiety?,"How long can a person stay on high alert about Covid?  I suffer from GAD  and have healthy anxiety.   
 I'm fully vaccinated and boosted.  But, each time I hear of someone I know getting Covid or hear local news about the hospitals in the area (my sister works at one and tells me daily what's going on), I get that feeling of adrenaline shooting through my body and I can literally feel my anxiety raising.  My head starts to pound, my hands shake, my fingers tingle.   I've been doing this throughout the entire pandemic.  I read about it every single day.  I recoil from my loved ones if they show any symptom whatsoever and then feel horrible about it.  I actually get angry at them if they don't feel well.  I look at everyone suspiciously to see if they look like they may be sick.  I question people like I'm interrogating them for a murder if they're stuffy.  I'm just constantly on high alert...constantly.  I've never caught it (knock on wood) and I'm not sure my fear is that I will die from it.  I don't really know what the fear is about.  What I am concerned about is what this anxiety is doing to my body.  I'm not sure how long a body can hold up through the constant barrage."

I can go down these rabbitholes that lead to extreme discomfort, this could be pondering over whether or not I have some kind of illness, what implications that would have in my life etc. I think this is probably pretty standard stuff for people who struggle with anxiety, so I wanted to ask if you guys have any advice on what I should try to do.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety, but I feel that both school and the pandemic have made my anxiety worse than ever. When it comes to socializing, even with people I’ve known all my life, I feel as though I’ve forgotten how to speak- which is why I avoid speaking altogether.
Not only that, but I’ve been experiencing major brain fog which has been affecting my work performance. 

Given that I have distanced myself from loved ones and have been performing poorly at work, I no longer know whether my loved ones and co-workers genuinely have negative impressions of me. I  don’t know if my actions are as severe as I’m making them out to be, or if I am being overly anxious.

now i can’t stop feeling anxious about it, and terrified about different things that i know don’t make sense but i still am paranoid about, like “oh what if we stop being friends later on and they tell everyone about my past and it’s the end for me” or “what if they’re judging me and think i’m a horrible person and they actually hate me now but are too scared to tell me” and just overall feeling  embarrassed and anxious when i see them sometimes? i really don’t think they would do that in the first place but i just end up getting super paranoid and find ways to protect myself 

i used to have a nasty habit of over sharing for (i admit) attention and care from other people, also because i was in high school and didn’t know how to process my feelings, but now i feel like i’ve done a complete 180 and now i don’t really open up at all or if i do it’s because i’m having a breakdown and end up overflowing because i can’t be alone in the moment. is there any way to help process this or just deal with my anxiety that comes from opening up to someone?"

Anxiety,"It’s always a good idea to get evaluated by a medical professional, even when non-medical therapists say you just have anxiety.","Disclaimer!!!!: If you have health anxiety, please be careful with how you interpret it. Please do not go obsessively googling your symptoms for hours upon hours. If you’ve been evaluated multiple times by multiple qualified doctors and they say you’re alright physically and have evidence to prove it, chances are it may be health anxiety. Yes, some doctors are dismissive assholes who fuel the paternalistic medical system (which disproportionately affects all women, women of color, impoverished women, and LGBTQ folks) and don’t do tests or don’t do the right tests and they dismiss your concerns as hysteria but you may have a real condition. If you have seen top doctors who do not support the fuckedupness of medicine and they tell you it’s probably anxiety, it is probably anxiety.

So for years I’ve felt chest tightness and sometimes pain when I’d stand for a while (so commonly in lines and in the shower). I would also literally feel like I’m dying and panicked when I exercised. This anxiety would get better or disappear when I’d lie down. I told my therapist about it and she told me it’s just anxiety. I said it felt different but she insisted it was anxiety and said anxiety can present itself in different ways. It started getting worse and more frequent and I started to get some more symptoms. I casually mentioned them to my school psychologist and she also insisted that my older and new symptoms were simply just anxiety because she specializes in anxiety.

Well, turns out, the “anxiety” I have been experiencing is just my heart freaking out and going from 66bpm to 120bpm when I stand. Cardiologist says orthostatic intolerance. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Explains a lot of the bs I’ve been experiencing, especially the chest stuff or “anxiety.” Oh and the coping techniques given to me never helped in these situations and some actually made it worse (breathing techniques). It’s a physical illness that is not psychogenic. It’s not all in my head like some have said to me :)"
Anxiety,Morning anxiety,I tend to experience a lot of stress and anxiety on a morning and often feel overwhelmed by the tasks I have to complete in the coming day.

Anxiety,[TW]. Apparently death anxiety decreases as we age.,"And I'm wondering why that is.

Many psychological research papers say that and even on r/AskOldPeople when this question comes up (which is alot). Most of them say that they don't fear death.  I wonder why.

Anxiety,Fear of death has led to not sleeping,"I was never afraid of death, I was so depressed I welcomed it! Now I have grown up and I fear death to the point I can't sleep. When I do drift of to sleep I wake up suddenly and have a panic attack that I have died and I can't get back to sleep. Which has resulted in 4 hours sleep this weekend. I'm so tired but so scared. I really want to go to my doctors for help but everytime in the past i just kept getting passed around and not actually helped.

Anxiety,Chaos is giving me anxiety.,"I think I am too chaotic a person and that is easily reflected in my lifestyle. It was never this bad before but now I have started to format my laptop at least twice a month and I keep updating and downgrading it every time I do that. I keep shifting my bed in my TINY room for no reason at all. It's just that I cannot get used to the space and that annoys me. I can't make a single decision about anything without going through bouts of anxiety and these are such trivial issues that I am not even sure if this qualifies as a problem. Before meeting my friends, i cancel and un-cancel at least a thousand times and they even expect it now. In terms of my career/studies I am completely lost. Everything seems interesting and boring at the same time. I think I could get somewhere if I were to just start but it's impossible for me to just start as there is a lot of thinking that goes into it which \[always\] leads to nothing."

Anxiety,Hyperaware of my thoughts and fear of going insane?,"I've been fighting anxiety and depression for a while now, and I've been having different symptoms such as depersonalization, health anxiety and breathing ocd. However, today I developed a new one which is the worst of all the previous symptoms I've experienced. First off, I apologize if this doesn't make any sense to you, because I have next to no idea how to describe this. About a few weeks ago, I've developed a symptom where I am constantly aware of my thoughts and the state that my mind is in currently. For example, whenever I see or read something, my mind automatically focuses on the way that particular thing processes into my mind and how the mind in general works, which hasn't been bothering me much. However, this has gotten drastically worse since then. I now feel like there's an endless flow of information passing through my mind. I feel like my mind is too loud (I do not hear voices) and that if it doesn't turn off or if I don't stop it, it will overtake me. I'm afraid that I'll go insane at any passing second due to being conscious of my thoughts before my consciousness can even process it. EVERYTHING I see and do scares me to death now and gives me panic like anxiety. It's a horrible feeling. I can't sleep or do anything anymore and my mind is locked on it 24/7. I can't distract myself no matter what. I even tried meditation but no luck.

 Have anyone here experienced the same? If so, what has helped you overcome this?"
Anxiety,Nothing much,"I just wanted to say that even though I feel like dying, i want to give myself credit for what I have done in the past two years.

I still grit my teeth, i still keep myself up at night, i still get palpitations and precordial catch, i still have to be alone half the time.  Things aren't great, they might get better or they might not, but I've worked hard.

Two years ago I was fully and completely dysfunctional.  Depressed, suicidal, relying on my family completely.  Inside in my room 22 hours a day, 7 days a week.  On the Internet probably 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  Showering only twice a week and sometimes not even washing.  It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it.  Struggling to simultaneously build up the will to live and discipline to work in order to apply for jobs, get interviews, in order to support myself, in order to... What?  Suddenly all my problems would be solved?

Well, during the two years of the pandemic, i eventually did work my way up from a short term part time job, to full time, to permanent, to a solid salaried job.  Went from low level in person work to higher level hybrid WFH work, went from no benefits to great benefits.  I have to admit that the sudden increase in demand for people to help with the preventative response to the pandemic did create a lot of job openings and i rode that wave.  I'm not sure what would have happened otherwise.  I had a plan that was growing in specificity for how I would throw in the towel during March of 2020.  But when the snowball started rolling, I decided I would try.  And it took a lot of terrible stomachahes, horribly exhausting mornings running on no sleep, absolute flop sweat heart pounding panic sessions gritting my way through intimidating interviews, new job trainings, new commutes, housing logistics, etc.  

But all in all, my situation has really changed in the last two years.  It hasn't all been good, I've made some bad decisions, lost some money, set myself back occasionally.  And it's not like all my problems are solved.  Far from it.  But the crucial lesson I'm internalizing is that I really can affect change upon my life.  No matter how dubious it feels beforehand, if I really throw myself at the goal, work smart and work hard, I actually can change what my life looks like. So even if I'm not in the ideal perfect place now, I should have proven that I have it within me to keep pounding away.  Even if there's a false summit ahead and the real high point is elsewhere in the distance, this climb hasn't been a waste.  I've shown myself what I can climb.  

Godspeed everyone"
Anxiety,Terrified for my medical procedure on Thursday,"I am having a colonoscopy and at this point, I am more scared of waking up and hearing what they are going to tell me. My symptoms have been fueling my anxiety since late August, and it is just so nerve-wrecking to know that depending on what they find, my whole life can change this week. I am only 21, started school again last year, and finally enjoyed where my life was heading after being depressed for years. I have so many plans for the future, and to know that it can all change in the blink of an eye this week terrifies me. I know it is very unlikely to be cancer, but it is still a worry based off my symptoms. I have not been able to fully focus on anything ever since I started feeling this way. I know I have to be an adult, suck it up, and do this for myself. But gosh it is hard. I am proud of myself for being proactive, despite my fears of getting put to sleep and everything else that comes with the procedure. Has anybody on here with severe anxiety had a colonoscopy before?"
Anxiety,I keep getting bad images in my head and I can’t get them out and I just wanna go to sleep,"Idk how to explain this but it’s making me really anxious and I almost wanna cry. It’s images of my dog jumping off a boat and drowning cause he doesn’t know how to swim. I know that’ll never happen because 1. I would never take him on a boat in a million years, 2. I’m terrified of boats so I wouldn’t even go near one and 3. My family is smart enough to never do that and I would NEVER let them do that. I really need help rn I just wanna go to sleep and get these images out of my head."
Anxiety,I want to a break for myself from everything. Need help!,"I want to isolate myself from social life including social medias and going outside with friends. I've finished my exams yesterday, I've plenty of time for a break.

Anxiety,I got gaslighted at work," 

I got gaslighted at work a couple of years ago. I still have suicidal thoughts I was fed a fantasy where my mind was flooded with so much dopamine that I was not aware of my surroundings. My former boss got away with sleeping with some of the girls and I was being pressured to sleep with some of the girls because that's the kind of culture and it felt like such an uncomfortable work environment I saw how that Department was able to psychologically manipulate people just by a mere thought but sadly, they got away with it. I have very little evidence of the gaslighting because I felt I could not move in that environment and people and staff used to such excitement and thrill of seeing other people hurt and seeing pain as a good thing where it turns you into psychotic behaviour because you absorb it. I am still struggling with it right now and I could not tell reality from fiction. My lawyers tell me there is no much I can do because there is very little evidence to back up my claims. I saw these people had links with criminal gangs and the police they used to get a real thrill of seeing other people getting hurt and suck the life out of you so they make themselves feel better and belittle you destroy your confidence and self esteem and become a co-dependent of other people.

I tried going through the Australian Human rights commission but that seems to be a slap on the wrist for them they still got away with it. I was given the illusion of freedom too where my confidence level was being controlled by a narcissism. Leadership seem to be nothing more than a scaring contest that's what it was and there was a high smoker rate and you could really feel toxicity in these people like the emotional baggage too and people being put through severe psychologically stress, trauma and intense fight or flight, or freeze responses to the point of no return I felt immobilised at my desk . Sadly, it has aged me quite a bit I have suicidal thoughts, cannot sleep properly, feel scared about my family how my life was being controlled psychologically. The Department had this thing called ""We Care"" but no one really cared in that Department and most of them have forgotten why they started in the first place and my life was being determined to their specifications and not to my own. What are my options? My brother who is a smart person says that I will lose if I take them to court. I am from Australia but it's hard to prove gaslighting and I saw them psychologically change people to their polar opposite where you cannot tell reality from fiction."

Anxiety,Had an awkward convo in the breakroom and can't stop replaying,"This is why I avoided the breakroom for the last 6 months and took all my breaks in my car, but it's freezing now. Too cold for car breaks. I thought I'd take my break inside like a normal person. But I'm not normal, so. 

I thought I was kinda forming a friendship with this coworker, we would chat briefly between tasks. Now after our weird interaction I'm afraid he is going to hate me and tell people what a fucking awkward loser I am. I'm already paranoid that people at work hate me and can tell I'm an awkward loser. Wish I would stop proving my weirdness to people and just act normal. My coworkers think I'm weird. My neighbors think I'm weird. My family thinks I'm weird. I'm just fucking weird."

Anxiety,My friends asked if I’m autistic and it kind of hurt?,"For all of my childhood I had diagnosed selective mutism. I think I’ve overcome it. I just like to assume I have social anxiety or that I’m socially awkward 
Anyway not long ago I said something random, twice for the sake of being random/funny until my friends friend asks if I’m autistic or aspie.  That she totally sees it and I might have undiagnosed Aspergers. 


I said I was offended and they brushed it off with there’s nothing wrong with having it, two of them have little brothers and sisters with Autism.   I thought about saying I obly have anxiety but decided it wasn’t worth it.   Should I have told them?

They sounded like they were joking or serious at the same time. I mean these same people bring up autism all the time anyways, for example “he gives me autism vibes” about a guy that kept hitting on me at the clubs. “I think he has autism. Not being rude or anything but in general” bout this guy in our zoom class that wouldn’t turn off his camera. 
It’s been an hour now and it’s still on my mind.
I don’t know why this hurts. 

 I had been accused of being autistic back in highschool three times actually.  It made me cry at one point.  Or the time my female friend told me “when you talk there’s no emotion in your voice. Kind of like the Sheldon guy from Big Bang theory.  You should talk with more emotion/expression. Then guys will like you. Don’t change anything else, your perfect.”   To her she was trying to help me but I was genuinely offended, why can’t I sound like a monotone kardashion instead?!  

I’m twenty two now.     Anyways some days I get so awkward, anxious or quiet.  I tried to do a beauty therapy traineeship.   just lost a simple job for being too slow, repeating the same mistakes etc.  my boss didnt understand why I was the way I was and asked if there was anything about me she needed to know, and I didn’t tell her thinking it would effect my job. I ended up losing the job anyways.  Makes me self pity myself over my condition and being an adult and probably never being able to keep a job, giving me the i want to jump off a bridge thoughts I’ve had since finishing highscjool. But I could never do it. 

Anyways. Now that I’ve gone off topic, baxk to the main one.   I don’t know why but being accused of that hurt, just like it did in highschool.  I don’t like my friends mutual friend anyways, he’s full of dumb offensive jokes.   I try to not care what people think and have an idgaf attitude that I want to naturally have.  But no, it’s still on MY MIND.    

Just forget it huh?  I can be abit quiet,  abit odd, crazy, socially awkward, quirky. That’s all.   

Advice"
Anxiety,So much work anxiety!,"so i started a new job at the start of October. I’ve had essentially nothing to do up until last week due to technical issues. Now i’m finally starting work, and going into the office (it was work from home for my
first few weeks) i’m so anxious. I was pretty anxious when i was working from home but now it’s so bad. i’m non-stop worried i’m under qualified/too stupid, i feel like my coworkers and managers hate me and or think i’m lazy/stupid, my social anxiety is through the roof 24/7 as i struggle to have enough energy to talk to people and do work (i’m a massive introvert). it’s a job in finance (something i have no qualifications/experience in but that is not necessary for my level of job). 

today, i was doing a process we have to do every morning. it was my first time doing it and i had to ask the person instructing me how to do it like 4 times. she already showed me once last week so i feel like this instructor fucking hates me now cause i keep having to ask her how to do stuff. 

i understand that part of this is imposter syndrome, i feel like an imposter 24/7 - whether in social life, relationships, music, art, anything. idk why but i just can’t fight. 

any help would be appreciated"

Anxiety,Forgot to pay my restaurant tab,"Hi, 

So I ate at a restaurant by myself. Staff was really nice and I enjoyed their food. After eating, I cleaned my table (put everything together), stood up, walked towards the restaurant's exit, struggled to push open the door, only to be stopped by a staff and be told that I haven't paid my bill yet. 

Jesus, I have completely forgotten that I was at a restaurant, not a fast-food chain. The staff was nice and handed me the bill, and I apologized, paid it and even gave him a huge tip, because it was embarrassing. 

When I got home, I called them and said sorry. They were nice and told me it was okay. 

I could not stop thinking about this. It was humiliating. My brain is really tired of thinking about so many things. 😑 I feel like disappearing."

I've not slept and I've been up having anxiety attacks all night. I'm throwing up and physically shaking. I don't know what to do. I can't go like this.
Anxiety,Can anxiety and stress effect your sleep when you aren’t even stressed or anxious at that time?,"I have been an anxious and stressed person for a very long time. I mainly suffer with health anxiety but i feel recently my sleep has been effected, hate sleeping in the dark because when i try go to sleep occasionally i get these little flashes, i don’t see them when i am awake just when my eye lids are closed. Random and weird thoughts that pop in my head, it’s like my brain is just making stuff up on the spot to think about. Also if my head hears or notices a sound it’ll put a thought or imagine to that when i am trying to rest. Also my eyes feel like they are moving 100 miles an hour when trying to rest them, they are physically moving but could be my eye lids. Also sometimes when i do wake up in the middle of the night i see weird shapes and lines in the dark for a few secs then it goes. I dunno but recently my sleep has been effected loads. My anxiety or stressed only gets triggered when i come across these just before bed i feel relaxed. Frustrating!. Anyone else like this."
Anxiety,Hiv scare,"I am female 21. Had my first sexual encounter a month and 1 week ago with a guy I went to the same high school as. I am paranoid that I might have HIV because. We had protective vaginal sex.
Which was very brief because I was too tight.  But  oral sex was unprotected and I swallowed some salty fluid I am assuming is precum.That's how I think I potentially contracted the virus
 He also spat on my vagina while going down on me. I am assuming I got bacteria or some sti/std from that. Also got a uti from that.
 a few days after the encounter my temperature was high, I had white stuff in the back of my throat and developed a few bumps on my vagina, experienced sweating and a different discharge not sure is it because of my virginity breaking.
What's very concerning is that I have been  experiencing very severe muscle ache in arms and legs numbness, stinging, tingling, pain, lack of blood flow in arms and legs.
Which I have never experienced before!
Because of this I am now convinced I have HIV. I am extremely scared.
At some point i thought it might be because of my vitamin deficiency but why now?
I have 6 weeks left before testing. But I am barely making it through. 
I am anxious in fear and this is running through my mind 24 7. I can barely fall asleep. I feel like I am on the verge of insanity. I can't help but Google something every single day.
I still talk to the him everyday but I don't know how to tell him about all of this.
Because I am assuming he might have HIV and doesn't know.
Which I don't even know.
So my is question is am I experiencing symptoms of HIV?😭😭
Or how likely is transmission from unprotected oral.
I just need some form of reassurance or advice."
Anxiety,Is that anxiety?,"Couple of days ago I had the worst panic attack in my life, I was about to pass out and my heart beat per minute was at 187 at the most for solid 40 minutes. And I was trying to sit etc, but had it at 150-187 all the time. (I’m 18 years old). That day I tought I will die, I would say I was 95% sure I’m dying.

Had same problems in school with heart beat rate around 140 while sitting, happend couple days.

Most of the time I feel like I’m dreaming, and I forget stuff easily, and can’t focus. I really hope I can get some help because things are getting worse for me.

Right now I was making beats on my computer, and randomly I feelt weird with my heart and tought I’m going to pass out, I got really stressed, and my heart beat per minute was at around 90 so it was/is normal. 

Any suggestions what I can do? Or someone knows what is wrong with me?
Kindly don’t ignore, I would like to hear yall toughts."
Anxiety,Suddenly very afraid of developing schizophrenia,"I’ve been having an extremely hard time sleeping tonight as I feel like I’ve suddenly been having really random thoughts tonight. This is hard to explain, but when trying to sleep I keep playing out random scenarios in my head involving other people, and then waking up to double check they’re not real. I’m now feeling very panicked and afraid and I feel like it’s making me feel more crazy. I’m now terrified that my fear and stress will bring on schizophrenia on its own. 

Tonight is random, but when I was looking at the symptoms and I’ve struggled with social anxiety for a while (where I think my friends don’t like me, tell myself things in my head in public and alone ect) and have even lately considered thinking I need to meet new people altogether because things just aren’t working out for me. I even have a gf who loves me and has for a few years. My friends all reassure me however, and I’m pretty sure Im normal but now I’m terrified that this is all sort of a delusion, or even worse, that my panic right now is going to bring on schizophrenia that I was never supposed to have. I’ve also had trouble sleeping for some time now and am extremely unfocused when it comes to school. 

Any reassurance or advice would be great as I can’t sleep anymore and am having a hard time trying to calm myself down. I’ve always been a very anxious person, especially when it comes to my health."
Anxiety,A terrifying young adult milestone.,"If not more intelligent, I am at least more worldly and experienced than my parents now.

I know that if I mess up or don’t get the job it won’t be the end of the world but I’ve been itching to work full time at an “adult” job so that I won’t be broke anymore. I’m tired of being a victim to my anxiety, tired of running away from potential opportunities because I’m afraid of putting myself out there. 

I used to have a hard time believing this but I’m a good person to have on a team! I’m honest and respectful, I work hard, learn new skills quickly, and have passion for a lot of things. I used to let these qualities be controlled by my fear of putting myself out there, but that ends TODAY! Now I’m channeling my nervous energy into unwavering confidence.

Wish me luck."

Anxiety,I’m feeling very hopeless and need to get this off my chest,"TW: SA, Death, Bullying


I’m in high school, I get straight As but I’ve been dealing with a lot and something snapped in me recently where I feel like I’ve completely given up. My mental health has been on a horrible decline since middle school. Unfortunately I experienced SA from another man my age. It was played for laughs in front of a large group of guys and a group of people I thought were my friends because they all thought I was gay and wanted to “test and see if I was” to mess with me, even though I wasn’t gay. I’m a straight man, and I was also young, so unfortunately I felt too embarrassed to speak about it. I didn’t even realize it had really effected my anxiety until this year. I have trouble being around groups of guys my age, I get this horrible feeling in my body where Im always on edge and feel like they’re going to do something to embarrass me. I have this constant unexplainable feeling every second I’m at school, and it progressively has gotten worse. My dog of 12 years recently passed away due to cancer, my family’s financial situation and living situation is at its worst, Ive recently found out a best friend of mine of 3 years SA his ex, I’ve been trying to fix my relationship with my father who I’ve had issues with since childhood, I’ve lost a sibling-like relationship I cherished with my cousin (who I am forced to live with) for my entire life, and I’ve been at my all time worst with my mental/physical health. This is all just this year so it feels way too overwhelming. We changed units about 2 weeks ago in all my classes and for some reason everything hit me at that exact time like a truck. I’ve been reaching my limit for a while now but I think I’ve reached way over it now. I’ve been missing school due to my anxiety, and I’ve been going to therapy but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping. We have a plan in place, but it requires me to hold out and continue going to school for a bit but I truly can’t deal with this anxiety more. It almost feels like I’m the only one seeing this as urgent. I’m really just looking for any sort of advice, as I just feel hopeless at this point."

Anxiety,What happened to me?,"
Hi all, this is my first post. I have been on this app reading peoples stories over the past weeks, trying to make sense of what is happening to me. I have decided to share my story, and I would appreciate any feedback from those that have had similar experiences or those that can offer advice.

Throughout my life, I have endured struggle. As a child, my parents neglected and abused me and my siblings. The abuse ranged from mental to physical, and came from my step dad, who regularly took all sorts of drugs and was a full blown heroin addict. My mother was also a heroin addict, although she never hurt me or my siblings, and I know she loved us all deeply. We were lucky, and had grandparents who would take us at the weekend. Spoil us, and make up for the terrible home life we had to endure. My grandmother was especially kind and nurturing. She was my mothers mother, and all she ever wanted was for my mum to be happy and to look after her children. I think if it wasn’t for my grandmother, maybe we would have been put into care. There is six of us, so we’d have all been separated, which was our worst fear as we depended deeply on one another, we still do.

In my teenage years i struggled a lot with controlling my emotions. One minute I was hyper and the next I would cry uncontrollably. I found it hard to make friends. My mother thought I might have bipolar as my moods would change so frequently, so she took me to the doctor. After being assessed my doctor said I was too young for a bipolar diagnosis and wanted to start me on an antidepressant. I was around 14 at this point. After a few days on the antidepressant I was more manic than ever. I stopped taking them immediately, and my grandmother who was a nurse was pretty pissed off that my doctor had put me on antidepressants. There was a lot going on at home. My youngest brother had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and epilepsy, which turned my mothers life upside down. She already had five children, this was her sixth. We all struggled to come to terms with his illness, and we all helped to care for him. My mum and step dad came off the heroin, which I was so proud of. Although, they both started to drink heavily, which I didn’t mind, as at the time I thought anything was better than heroin?

With so much going on at home, me and my brother moved in with my grandparents. I was around 15/16 at this point, and just about to leave high school. I had missed a lot of school, skipped my GCSE exams and just simply did not care about my future. My grandmother gave me the kick up the arse that I truly needed. I managed somehow to get into a good college, and I finally started to work on my education. At home (my grandparents house) I was happy. My gran would take such good care of me and my brother, even though we could be awful, troublesome children at times. For the first time in my life I felt genuinely happy. Like I could actually achieve something in life. I wasn’t just a troubled kid, I was loved, clean, cared for. My clothes smelt nice and not like cigarettes, I had an allowance, a bus pass. As stupid as it sounds, these are the things I used to envy from the other kids.

Then, just after my 18th birthday, when my life was finally starting to make sense. My beautiful wonderful amazing kind and ever so caring grandmother fell ill with cancer. 8 weeks later she was gone. Just like that. My whole world turned upside down. After that everything just got worse and worse. Grandad couldn’t cope and would drink every night. Him and my brother would fight, and he eventually kicked my brother out of the house. He would reject anyones help but mine. I didn’t have much time to grieve. I struggled most nights to get my grandad into bed as he would drink so much he would collapse onto the floor. Every night. It was like a nightmare that wouldn’t end. No one helped me with him because he was volatile to everyone else. I love my grandad deeply, and would never have left him this way no matter how hard it was. I smoked a lot of marijuana during this time, which I truly believe got me through the moments of madness that I endured.

As time went on he got much better and we decided to go on vacation. Well the vacation was a major turning point in my life, as I met the man of my dreams!! He was from another country, so we would visit each other frequently. Eventually I fell pregnant, at only 19 I had my daughter. I was so happy. He moved over to live with me and my grandad and for 2 years we raised our daughter there. Eventually we moved to his home country and bought our own house, which was stressful , but we did it just the two of us. Grandad would visit for weeks at a time, still does. I go home and see my family all the time too as I miss them terribly. Over the years I had been happy, up until 2018. I got a call from my sister. Mum was poorly and I needed to get home. I flew straight home and sat by my mothers side and watched for weeks as she physically deteriorated in front of us. The drink had destroyed her liver, and she was also suffering from sepsis. It was traumatising what we went through in that hospital. No child should ever have to watch their parents die that way. Her body swelled, her legs developed lesions from the sepsis, her eyes protruded out of her head. She called out in pain all day and night. My beautiful mother. She was honestly so beautiful. Life was so cruel to her. She had a good heart and only ever wanted the best for her kids, but drugs and my step dad always crushed her dreams.

I was 22 when this happened to me, when I lost my beloved mother in this cruel way. This was the first time I ever felt the severity of depression. I went straight to the doctor and he prescribed 100mg of sertraline. I stayed in my home country for a while and grieved alongside my siblings, before returning to my parter and daughter. Everything seemed surreal and just weird. I quickly started a new job and over time, everything just started feeling a little easier. I believe the sertraline helped, but I didn’t feel like myself. After around a year, I fell pregnant and thought it best that I come off the meds for the sake of the baby. I discussed this with my doc and slowly weaned off them.

One Friday, whilst my grandad was over visiting, he fell poorly so I took him straight to The ER. I called work to let them know and my boss was very unhappy, and asked me why someone else couldn’t have taken him! I was pregnant, just come off my meds, worried sick about my grandad and super stressed. My boss told me not to bother coming into work the next day and to come in for a meeting on Monday. The next day (Saturday) I started bleeding. It was too early for the doctor to tell me whether I had miscarried or not, so I had to wait a week for a scan. Monday came around and I went into work and unleashed hell on my boss! I was so emotional! She was rude to me and told me that she couldn’t trust me. Before this event I had never her let her down not even once! I told her to get fucked and walked out of there. Grandad was still in hospital and I was potentially having a miscarriage, all of which she was aware of! Damn it still makes me mad when I think of how badly she treated me that day! I cried so much. A week later grandad and was better but my worst fear was confirmed, I’d miscarried.

Not long after, Covid arrived. I had started my dream job as a writer, working from home. Just perfect for me. I’m an introvert, I love my own company. I love being at home with my dog and knowing that we can always keep each other company. I get to take and collect my daughter from school every day. My partner is excelling in his career. Everything is good. I’m not taking meds, I’m not depressed, I’m not anxious. In fact, I could even say I was feeling the happiest I ever had before.

Im 26 now. A few weeks ago we went on vacation. We surprised our daughter and told her once we got to the airport! We were all so excited and had a great time on holiday. Just beautiful, family time. I got to watch her in the pool making memories, having the time of her life. I read by the pool, listed to music, worked on my tan. It was just lovely. Then on the second to last day I started to feel really weird. We were out for dinner, and all day I’d felt kind of off. Agitated. I had this weird twitch in my arm that wouldn’t go away. It felt kind of painful, like someone was pinching my arm. As we finished eating our dinner I was looking at my partner. He was talking to me and I just zoned out. The room started to spin, and I had the worst heart palpitations of my life. I immediately got up and left the restaurant, no explanation. I couldn’t. I could barely breathe. I headed back to our hotel room and locked myself in the bathroom. I felt this deep, deep pain in my chest that just would not go away. This went on all night and I eventually managed to fall asleep. The next morning we were to pack for home, as our flight was that evening. I still felt so Grimm. I decided to just get on with the packing and get it over with, get us home! The day dragged and I still felt the weird arm twitches and pain in my chest. I just got on with it, I didn’t feel stressed or anxious, at least I don’t think I did. The airport went smoothly, and then we boarded our flight. All was good, until we took off. The twitch in my arm got faster and faster and the pain in my chest felt deeper and deeper. Bare in mind I’m not a nervous flyer, I fly all the time.

The chest pain got worse to the point I couldn’t breathe. The air hostess took me to the back of the plane and gave me oxygen. As I lay on the floor my whole body seized up. I couldn’t move my arms and my hands were as cold as ice. It was terrifying. Any time they sat me up the pressure in my heart would get worse very quickly, so I stayed lay down. All I could think was this is it, I am going to die. My whole life flashed before my eyes. There was a nurse on board helping me, she recommended emergency medical attention. Everything from here is kind of hazy. I remember being carted off the plane on a stretcher. We had landed on a tiny island off the coast of Portugal. The medical team didn’t speak much English, so they couldn’t understand anything I said, which was probably mumbled madness. They got me to their tiny hospital, stripped my clothes off, bar my underwear and started injecting me in my stomach and arms. It was fucking SCARY. Like a horror movie. My body was very low on potassium and I was dehydrated, so they put me on two drips. They also gave me an antibiotic drip and injected blood thinner. Then they stuck a Valium under my tongue and I got very sleepy and relaxed. I kept worrying about my partner and daughter and kept asking where they were. Eventually a doctor who spoke English came and told me that I’d had a panic attack and that my partner and daughter were here in the hospital waiting to see me. I burst into tears. A panic attack? I’ve endured so much pain in life, including a completely natural childbirth – but I had never ever felt pain like that. I was in disbelief, but all my tests come back ok. My heart and lungs were fine. They did blood tests, x rays etc. I just couldn’t believe it. They kept me in for observation and discharged me in the morning with a pack of benzodiazepines. 

I learnt that when the plane landed, it came in too hard and damaged the plane. All the passengers were put into a hotel for the night, until the next morning. I felt terrible and couldn’t stop crying. All I could think of is all the trouble I had caused over a stupid panic attack. The thing is, the pain in my chest never went away, and it still felt like I was being crushed. I felt weak and empty. I went straight from hospital to the airport, the airplane was waiting for us and we took off straight away. I felt ashamed getting on a flight full of people who I’d delayed for over 12 hours. I took one of the benzodiazepines and fell asleep. Many of the passengers came up to me and said kind words to me, wishing me a speedy recovery or asking if I was ok. Some people had made friends with one another whilst in the hotel and were exchanging phone numbers. A guy behind us shouted “where to next on the wonderful plane of adventure” and everyone laughed. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits which made me feel much better. I like to think that all things happen for a reason and maybe we weren’t meant to be on the first plane?

Anyway, I got home and went straight to the doctor about the chest pain. She diagnosed me with costochondritis and anxiety. She gave me pain killers - anti inflammatories, cocodamol and LEXAPRO 5mg for first week then up to 10mg on day 8. 

The costocondritis is inflammation of the cartilage between your ribs and sternum, and I have read that It can cause heart attack like symptoms. I wonder did that happen, and did that bring on the panic attack? This condition has caused me so much pain, if I miss one anti inflammatory I feel like my chest is going to explode. Ever since I got home I just don’t feel right. The Costo pain is so strong I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. The anxiety seems to just linger all day everyday like a cloud of doom.

In regards to the anxiety and panic attacks, why now? After everything I’ve been through and put up with and dealt with, why now? When my life is at its best? That’s why I wanted to tell the whole story, because I’m trying to wrap my head around it. The lexapro is pretty hard to get used to. The side affects alongside the costo has been a journey. Today is day 8, so I’ve upped to 10mg of lexapro. I was scared to this, this morning. I thought about snapping one in half and staying on the 5mg for a bit, but then I thought fuck it and chucked it down. After about an hour it knocked me for six, and I had to lay down. I had a huge heart palpitation and felt a little woozy. So I lay down in bed and here I am, typing up my life story, wondering what the fuck went wrong. Never wanted to be on meds but here I am. I don’t feel ashamed, just confused. Also, I’d take any pill to avoid enduring that kind of pain ever again. 

If you made it this far, thanks for taking time out of your day to read about mine. Please, share your stories with me, they make me feel better. I am open to advice, criticism, whatever. I just want to make sense of this new me. 

Have a lovely beautiful day ❤️"
Anxiety,Have an upcoming procedure i need to be sedated for. How do i calm myself down?,So i have never been put out before. Its one of my worst fears. Idk why but it completely freaks me out bad. I have had a fistula removed and almost left due to almost needing to be sedated. I finally got a epidural instead. But with this procedure i dont have that choice. I get vertigo alot especially when im sleepy and so im super worried it will induce vertigo.  Any suggestions? ( its an endoscopy)
Anxiety,Intense anxiety... Help!,"First off, I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense because I have next to no idea how to describe this. I've been fighting depression and anxiety for a long time now, and I have had many different symptoms such as breathing ocd, depersonalization, hyperawareness and health anxiety. 

Recently, I developed a new symptom in which I am overly aware of my consciousness and my thoughts as well as the state of my mind. For example, whenever I see or do something, my mind automatically focuses on how that particular thing is processed into my thoughts and the concept of mind in general. Also, not being able to let the thoughts flow and being conscious of them all time. This caused panicking as as well as small tension headaches. However, it got drastically worse now, to the point where I can't sleep and it causes me to get panic attacks at least once everyday. Long story short, it feels like I am way too conscious of my thoughts before my consciousness can even process it. It's a very uncomfortable feeling. I feel like I can't control my thoughts, and there is a seemingly nonstop flow of words and information racing through my mind. I'm scared to crap that I'll go insane or completely lose my mind at any passing second if I don't turn my mind off or stop it somehow. I am aware of my thoughts 24/7 and I find it really hard hard take my focus off of it. The only thing that seemed to have helped a little was distracting myself. However, that only works temporarily and the thought comes back once I'm alone in my thoughts again. I'm afraid that I'll be stuck in this mindset forever :(

Has anyone here experienced anything similar? If so, what has helped you overcome this?"

Anxiety,I am deteriorating,I am on the verge of panic all day every day. I feel like my brain is slowly deteriorating to a shell of its former self.
Anxiety,"Need advice, help and support about anxiety and derealization","Hello everyone, 

During my childhood I have had some mild derealization events that lasted a few hours, a few days at most that went away by themselves. I have also suffered from periods of severe anxiety (few weeks) that were handled very well with benzos.

One month ago a new derealization period started and it didn't go away. Of course it triggered a lot of anxiety, maybe the worst I have ever had so far. Questions like ""Will it last forever ?"", ""Am I going insane ?"", ""Is my life ruined ?"", etc ; keep floating in my brain and I cannot shut them off.

Two weeks after it started I decided to visit a psychiatrist following the directions of my GP. It went well and we had a nice talk. He was understanding and he also was familiar with the issue. He estimated that it will go away on it's own and that no medication is needed at the moment. That I should try to relax and live a normal life as much as possible and come back in 1 month to talk about it again, has it disappeared or not. He told me he is confident it will. It reassured me.

Unfortunately it's been two weeks already and it's not going away yet. The problem is that I don't know how to handle this oppressing and overwhelming feeling. 

Sometimes I cannot help but google the condition. I read horrific things and it makes my anxiety skyrocket. Being afraid of it not going away...

Do you have any advice at this point ?  
I will see my psychiatrist in two weeks, I guess I need to be told it will be okay.. I don't want to live like this.

Thanks all for reading."
Anxiety,Does Anyone Else Feel Like Their Medication Is A Hinderance?,"As the title says. Lately I’ve been thinking my medication is more hurtful of any meaningful progress than actually facilitating it. I’ve been on medications for nearly 2 years now with therapy semi regularly and don’t feel like I’ve really progressed in controlling my anxiety but more so have been made aware of it and why. 

Is this a common thought process?? I feel like I’m overly reliant on my medication to just.. *fix* me?

I have a doctors appointment lined up in two days. Not sure if I’m crazy for feeling like this or not."
Anxiety,Is it possible to have anxiety over progress?,"Howdy y’all, I’m not asking for a diagnosis. I haven’t experienced anxiety attacks that I know of or issues talking to people. But, In the past 2 years though I’ve developed an issue putting effort into things.

From something small like a personal project, to even opening my syllabus for class. I get these weird stomach feelings, I notice I pace a lot and feel really overwhelmed. I always figured I just didn’t like school but now I think it’s different.

It only seems to come up when I’m doing something to better myself. Work, school, life projects. I’m beginning to think it’s not normal to have those feeling so constantly. everyone says they hate school and work so I thought I was just being dramatic.

I’m hoping to get a jumping off point to talk to my therapist about it next session"
Anxiety,Money.,"Man. I woke up this morning and didn’t immediately have racing thoughts about a particular subject. I usually do. I usually fixate on something upsetting (not that I want to). Later, I got to work. There it was. Money. I wanted to doordash because I didn’t bring anything with me. But then I started thinking about how I shouldn’t be spending money like that, I should save. But then I think, what’s the fucking point of saving. I’ll never have that much with the type of work I do, no matter how frugal I am. And what’s the fucking point of working and making money if I don’t use it. God, I just want food. Then I think about how I need to lose weight and my fat ass doesn’t need to doordash for that reason."
Anxiety,Do not take prednisone!!,Literally the devils pill if you have anxiety.
Anxiety,I have hard time to distinguish myself from different emotion,"I don't know where to start.

I have insane insomnia for 2 years+ , I didnt face it for a long time but recently started to take sleeping pills. I am heavily depressed recently and can't stop having suicidal thoughts. Last weeks I was so upset to an extend that I was feeling 'unconscious' on the street. Sometime I am anxious about my job, my future and think that everyone actually hate me. I think in fact I have done a pretty good job faking myself around everyone and at least everyone does not hate me.For me 'well-socializing' seem like a skill rather than my personality.

I found that I also have heavy mood swing. I have a job that need to face a lot of different people a lot of time. I am getting used to wear a mask that pretend I am happy and friendly. I also feel that I can't control being 'faked' after job and having hard time controlling my emotion. Some day I am heavily depressed after work + on holiday, these few days I can't control myself from laughing even no one around me.

Can someone tell me what happened to me? I am having difficult time these few months, I cant stop having suicidal."
Anxiety,Discouraged &amp; Anxious in my 20s,I'm taking .25 clonazepam twice a day for my anxiety and pseudo-seizures and I just wanna know if the rumors are true. Am I sworn off alcohol for the rest of my life now? I'm not an alcoholic in my opinion but I just feel like I'm about to be 25 and a huge part of being young and social has been ripped from underneath me as an option.  I dont like being around drunk people or smelling alcohol if I'm not drinking so it makes me not wanna go out. But as an extroverted person I love being around people. I do enjoy a good time and having a drink or two with friends or family. Or getting socially drunk every once in a while. I feel like I just won't have that again with this medication or any benzo at that point but it's what I keep getting prescribed. its what works I guess. but it doesn't seem worth it. I dont even like the idea of taking meds forreal. I'd rather just smoke recreationally it helps me with my anxiety but my husband recommended pills because my anxiety was getting a bit much for him and I was in the hospital for an anxiety induced seizure for the first time in 3 years. so I did it for him. so I couldn't have drinks with my family at thanksgiving. my birthday and New Years eve is coming up. no egg nog at Christmas. I'm turning down events left and right and I just dont like that. I'm a very social person and I think I'm losing out on that just so I dont feel anxious. which sounds good sometimes. feels like a good trade but sometimes you have a stressful day and you want a beer. I dont wanna think about the google search that told me I might not wake up afterwards ya know? anybody taking klonopin/clonazepam and drinking comfortably? just curious. been too scared to do it. is there anything else anyone can recommend for anxiety that doesn't say you can never drink?
Anxiety,Morning anxiety," I wake up with My heart beating so fast and feeling super anxious, i can't be on My Bed for more than 10 minutes without feeling so much anxiety....and this happens every day, does any of You have any tips or recomendations for this?"
Anxiety,One thing to another,"Hi guys! For about ten days, I have had this weird thing where I completely fixate on one thing - and once I feel less anxious about it, something new happens within a few hours. I feel anxious 24/7. Is there something to break the cycle? So far I only had „occasional“ anxiety."
Anxiety,35 and i think it's time for me to finally face my anxiety head on and get therapy + medication.,"I've lived with anxiety since i was in middle school. But i have religious abusive parents who would tell me not to seek help, but talk to god. They'd frown upon people who needed to take medication for mental disorders saying horrible things like ""youre not you when you take those, it changes your personality"" And it would terrify me because who doesn't want to be themselves? So i bare with my anxiety for a good two decades. But i'm done. Because it's getting worse. Now its affecting my sleep. For the past week, every night i'm sleeping only 3 hours. My heads in a fog and my body is in pain. I told my husband i can't take this anymore. I need help. He's taking me to my doctor today. For anyone who currently or used to take anxiety medication. Could you please ease my fears. What's taking those like?"

Anxiety,Did this guy have anxiety?,"I was texting this guy who I met on Tinder. We were talking about how we both liked art. And he said he had tickets to this art exhibit. I asked him who he was going with. He said he wasn't sure and would maybe give the tickets to his mom and boyfriend. So I said I think we should meet at the exhibit and he never replied this was in September two months ago and today he replied with this

*Hey, I want to apologize to you for never responding. Anything I say would be a poor excuse (and it is), so it's hard to explain in a text. I was feeling awkward at the time and not understanding your message, with the art event being a few months away, so I let a few hours become a day, which became two days and so on... until I felt I had waited too long to say anything. No need to respond, just please know that was a real failure on my part and that I'm sorry for that and hope you're well.*"
Anxiety,My life Is now anxiety.,"For me, it started in 2012. My sister was very sick with alcoholism and pill abuse. My mom had COPD and was  probably depressed. My dad had kidney cancer that he chose not to treat. 
2013. All of the above people passes away. This was the start. 
2018. Marriage is going good. Husband felt some lumps in his midsection. Next come the tests. Stage 4 appendix cancer. Maybe with a few months to live.
Huge surgery. Colostomy bag. ER  when some complications happened. 

So this is where I have had my anxiety start up and never leave. I can quiet it. But I know it is always there. And might be there forever."
Anxiety,Anxiety after social situations,"I usually avoid so many things because of my anxiety, but sometimes when I get invited to some event and don't go, depression kicks in later. So this Saturday I decided to go along, despite feeling like a mess. 

Saturday was pretty fun for me, went to a local tattoo convention, met some cool people, saw some nice art. It was really a fun, decent day.

But now, because of it, my anxiety has only gotten worse. These past two days have been hell. I want to delete my socials again. I'm constantly overanalyzing if i said or did something wrong, questioning if I behaved ""off"", worrying about how people perceived me. I really know that I shouldn't be doing this, but it really IS out of my control. These past two days are really tough on me... I'm on a verge of crying once again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for comfort on here. How do you guys deal with similar situations? How can I help myself? This has been my life for a looong time, but it's only getting worse and I'm running out of tools to help myself."

Anxiety,"Need advice: Anxiety, Loss, Grief, PTSD and Trauma Treatment Centers (USA)","First time posting. I’ve talked with insurance and our behavioral specialist team with my company directly. I have been in therapy for 12 years, and recently lost my therapist as she is fighting stage 4 cancer and currently undergoing chemotherapy. I’ve been searching for new therapists since 2 months ago but the backlog of therapists aren’t seeing new patients until February 2021.

I have generalized anxiety disorder. In my 12 years of therapy I thought i had built a large toolkit of resources to cope with my anxiety. Then, my 25 year old brother tragically passed away due to complications from COVID in February, 2021. It shattered my family that was already pretty broken. I’m pretty broken. I don’t have the tools in my toolkit to cope with loss, anxiety, PTSD and trauma resulting from my brothers tragic death. 

My anxiety has since quadrupled and I’m finding it hard to manage anything in life right now. The circumstances of my brothers loss have brought extreme PTSD and Trauma to me, which is compounding my anxiety to a point where I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’m not depressed or suicidal. Don’t need help with substance abuse or addiction- I just want my anxiety 

The ask: any personal experiences or recommendations for inpatient or outpatient programs in the USA? I’m willing to do anything to get my brain back.

Anxiety,Scared of MRI scan,"I have an upcoming MRI scan (head and neck) and I am terrified. I can't imagine how I will survive 30 min in that closed up space. Does anyone have any tips for me? I am somewhat claustrophobic, I do not use elevators for this reason."
Anxiety,What’s the process to getting prescribed anxiety meds?,Anxiety meds seem like they’d be so helpful.  I’ve been struggling so much lately but haven’t reached out to a professional about it because I’m still on my family/parents health insurance and my parents don’t believe in mental disorders.  I’m a broke college freshman so my options are limited in that regard but I’d appreciate any advice!
Anxiety,I have extreme anxiety and dissociation regarding substance use when it comes to romantic relationships and I need a bit of advice.,"I was raised by a father who liked to drink and other things and disappear from time to time (ultimately he ended up in jail). Then I was raised by my grandfather who also drank and would completely change even after one drink. A lot of this caused me to dissociate and distance to prevent what could be or what could happen.

To this day, in my 30s, I get triggered when I am with someone that has a past related to drugs and alcohol (romantic relationships). It happens when we get closer and closer, and, even more so when their past trickles into the present. I had and have my own issues with alcohol but always choose to abstain when I am in a relationship.

I have indulged in some of these vices myself and I choose everyday to not drink or partake in other substances (I do fail sometimes).

I never ever judge someone's past and I really enjoy them for who they are, but I usually end up with sleepless nights and anxiety just not feeling safe no matter how much time passes in the relationship. It gets to the point where even if they enjoy a glass of wine I get triggered and I hate myself so much for it and I just sit with the fear.

To note, I also have ocd regarding intrusive thoughts and been doing therapy for years and hard work regarding this yet this issue does not seem to go away and I am not sure to this day if this something I should continue working on when it comes to significant others with a past that entails drugs and alcohol or should I just look for someone who does not have such things in the past and keep on searching.

I sometimes feel shitty writing this because I always believe it is always worth trying to work through your issues, especially through open communication with your partner, but it's so exhausting as it just keeps coming back despite all the work that is effort or effortless."

Anxiety,Depersonalization advice,"I'm 30F and been having episodes of depersonalization lately. I feel overwhelmed. I have had this before but it wasn't this bad.

I work in a foreign country but now I'm stuck home because of the pandemic. I have been working online for almost two years with zero social life. I think this is making things way worse. 

I don't know how to get out of this. Sometimes I wonder don't other people question their existence. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this. I want to get back to normal.

Have you experienced something like this?

Any advice would really help me."
Anxiety,Should I be worried about carbon monoxide poisoning?,"Hey everyone!

Since i've been sick with a flu this weekend i've been full chill mode in the living room, playing on my ps4 with the fireplace going. So sitting in my living room with the fireplace lit(wood burner), I threw on a few more logs and lowered the ventilation so it would slow burn. Being kinda out of it with the flu I managed to lower it to the lowest ventilation setting. Didn't think much about it.

45 min to 1 hour passes of me just sitting in the couch, when my roommate walks in the room. He says there is a gray tone of smoke(I couldn't see it) as well as heavy air in the room.

He then told me about the potential for carbon monoxide poisoning, and that really stressed me out. I contacted the poisoning info hotline, as well as the ER. I got a small headache, but I was really focusing on whether I had one or not. But with me already being sick it was really hard to tell about symptoms aswell.

Went to the doc and they said it didn't seem like nothing over a mild case of CP. But im still kinda anxious about it :( My thoughts alwasy go to the worst case scenario, i. e permanent damage that will show up later.

I think im overreacting, but I can't help but feel really bad about this."

Anxiety,Severe anxiety about covid shot,"Hello, i have a covid shot scheduled today, its the third or fourth ive made after cancelling the others. I contiue to read about different vaccines and potential associated events like blood clots, strokes, and death. At this point i feel paralyzed, stupid and defeated on making any type of decision and just want to stay in my house forever. I know what i should do but i also dont want something terrible to happen from a vaccine."
Anxiety,People trying to help: am I right to feel defensive?,"I am on an intensive placement. Struggle to complete my first big assignment. Everyone including mentor seem too busy to talk about feelings. Already received some insensitive approaches to my struggling (i.e. you seemed fine last we spoke, this is what works for me, Covid has been affecting everyone in strange ways). Cried in secret today at unreliable points of contact constantly rearranging or saying ‘can it wait’. 

Finally got a meeting to catch up and schedule next few assessments. They assumed a therapist role in which I could see that they thought they were helping, but every time I was thinking/sometimes said I’d tried that and it didn’t work. Just unhelpful and made me uncomfortable - when I asked to discuss other things they were offended. Wasn’t even a private space. Followed by a phone call with student support advisor. Felt rushed. They were late by two hours and got interrupted mid-call. 

Sorry, I feel angry and stressed. Frustrated that my options are so limited and people can’t just listen to my needs and empathise. Still haven’t communicated fully because I feel ‘shut down’. This is why I never asked for help in the past.

Fortunately, I start counselling on Thursday."

Anxiety,Anxiety over surgery,I was suppose to have oral surgery today to remove an extra tooth located high up on the left side of my mouth below my sinus. It got cancelled because it's too complicated and they prefer I be fully asleep and surrounded by a medical team. I already was shaky today and feeling sick to my stomach. But now I feel even more sick knowing I couldn't get operated on today  to allow for more safety for me. I also need to have a endoscopy done soon and a ct scan to determine if I should go through with surgery for my deviated septum.   Anything bloody makes me woozy. Any advice for the anxiety over the procedures soon to be.

Anxiety,"If it could just stop, that'd be great...","Has anyone else had anxiety just pop up out of nowhere?

I've had panic attacks before in the past, but they never bothered me. I never fixated on them. I just went about my business the next day. Also I had zero anxiety symptoms. No dpdr, no shakiness, no increased heart rate, just no anxiety minus the 3 times I had panic attacks.

But about 4 months ago, I'm suddenly having tons of anxiety symptoms, getting panic attacks that leave me shaken for days, anticipating my next panic attack, and just living in a heightened sense of fear and uneasiness.

Granted these symptoms showed up when I had a major life changing event. But I've had major life changes before and never had anxiety...So I'm wondering what's so different now?

Can anyone else relate to this? And if you have had anxiety from a major life changing event, were you eventually able to go back to the way you were before anxiety?

I miss my old self...."
Anxiety,Three Tips For Overcoming Anxiety,"The following guide from a $300M-valued startup founder where he explains anxiety as a natural reaction to major stress, as well as how the more you'll overcome anxiety with the following three practices, the more you'll progress: [How To Overcome Anxiety: 3 Proven Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHPLF7Qsv6E)

1. Physical practice - note it down and articulate your emotional and physical reaction.
2. Intellectual practice - focus your 100% control on your input, on that you are doing, because your output is actually out of control, the biggest cause of stress and anxiety is the feeling of lack of control.
3. Emotional acceptance - remember that your life is measured in decades, not in days."

Anxiety,Anxiety about not sleeping and moving,"Hi there,   
I am moving soon. I am having anxiety about moving and about not sleeping either before the move or once I get to my new place. Whenever I get not enough sleep or no sleep at all, I start panicking and freaking out, and it sets off my nerves. My anxiety has been hard to deal with the whole day so far today. I have tried breathing, as well as taking a shower and nothing  has worked. I didn't get enough sleep last night and I woke up in a panic, which I couldn't fall back asleep. I just need some positive words, advice, support, and prayers right now. I just want to get through this.   
Thank you."
Anxiety,Anxious about Common Cold And COVID,Hi. I was at college the other day sitting next to someone who was not wearing their mask properly or at all. They claim to have a cold and coughed without covering. I am anxious that I will get sick. I was wearing a mask. Would the mask provide any protection? I have a immune system issue so whenever I get sick I get brain fog😩. Do you think that I will sick?
Anxiety,I don’t know what to do anymore.,"Posting here because I don’t know where else to. I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety my whole life (31yrs old). But lately my anxiety is the worst it has ever been. For the past 8 months I’ve been living in an apartment where my neighbor blasts music/slams doors all day and night making me constantly on edge and my sleep rare and interrupted (have tried talking to them, filing complaints etc and nothing helps). It’s impossible for me to move right now because of finances. I got laid off of my job during Covid and haven’t gotten a new one. I have an abusive family so I haven’t talked to them in years and I lost all my friends and support during the pandemic. I tried to reconnect with an old friend but I ended up having a full blown panic attack in public with them and I had to go home. 
I‘ve had panic attacks before but in the past year or so my anxiety has gotten so bad that I am having several attacks per day that last pretty much the whole day. It’s effecting my physical health so much that I can’t eat or drink much even when I try to force myself. I’ve had to go to the hospital for an IV and treatment multiple times this year because my bp has dropped to dangerously low levels. 
I’ve seen a psychiatrist who has prescribed me benzos and other medication but my anxiety is legitimately so high that the pills barely help. I have tried to see 3 different therapists this past year and all of them ended up being a negative experience (ghosting me, talking about themselves the whole session, etc) and it has made me not want to even try to get a new one. 
I also struggle with side effects from a head injury I received years ago. 
I’ve had some hard times in life but this is genuinely the first time that I have no idea what to do. I feel so ashamed that I’ve spent the last year basically in bed all day barely moving. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t see a way of this getting better and I’m so exhausted and just feel stuck. Seems like every time I try to make a little bit of progress a new issue comes up. I’m so sick of being in my own head and all these spiraling thoughts."
Anxiety,MRI tomorrow and I'm really nervous,"My neurologist wants me to have an MRI due to new things happening with my chronic migraine, she mailed me the form in October and I never got it done. I tried, I really did. I scheduled it and went in, but as soon as I got in the machine I had a panic attack and they asked me to reschedule. I had a MRI years ago and did great, so I thought it would be no problem. I'm disappointed in myself. All the thoughts just rushed in when I laid down, what if it's not safe? What if I pass out in there and die? What if? Goodness am I tired of what ifs. I rescheduled, and now it's tomorrow afternoon. I thought I'd post here and see if anyone has any tips for me, or even just a positive story about their experience. 

Adding in that I've been in therapy for my anxiety disorders for a few years now. Currently trying to find a different person to see as my current therapist is not helping me at all."
Anxiety,Feeling Overwhelmed?,"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety.

### Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:

&amp;#x200B;

**Identify what you can and can’t control.** List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control.  

**Focus on solutions.** Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, identify your chosen end point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.

**Prioritise your actions.** Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.

**Communicate.** With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.

**Eat well.** Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.

**Gratitude.** It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.

**Blow off some steam.** Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s sleep. 

**Get your rest.** Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.  

**Celebrate your successes.** Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
   
 

**Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.**"
Anxiety,random feeling of anxiousness,"few mosts ago im not sure if i posted it but my anxiety relapsed and it might have been to big life changing events , also my dr thinks the pandemic is part of it . For the past while i felt fine but just the last half an hour ive felt anxiety creeping up again and last time i was anxious all this scary stuff happened, im not talking mentally im talking they really did happen and i got sick and everything"
Anxiety,im constantly paranoid and worried that ive done something bad :(,its 3am and my chest is SO tight and im all anxious and everything feels wrong and all im worried about is what i couldve possibly done wrong in regards to my relationship?? but i really havent done anything at all. everything is fine yet im so anxious. im supposed to see my gf tomorrow and im just so nervous and worried for some reason ugh
Anxiety,Am I having anxiety attacks?,"Hi all. Male in my 30s here, 6ft tall and about 72kilos. For a few months now I've been waking at night with my heart suddenly beating fast (Fitbit says like 110-120bpm and my resting is 63bpm). I've called an ambulance once as I thought I was having a heart attack. Ambulance crew checked me over and said all vitals were fine. Have been to doctor about 3 times now and on each occasion the blood test and checks on my heart, lungs etc with stethoscope didn't provide him any concern. I am going to get a heart monitor from doctor to see if there is a reason for palpitations but doctor thinks anxiety is most likely. I know in light of the above what I'm about to say sounds crazy but I can't shake the worry that there is something wrong with my heart, and each time I get a racing heart I fear it is a heart attack. Just wondering if anyone else here has experienced similar, and guess I'm looking for reassurance. Feeling lost, sad and worried. Hopefully within community rules, apologies if not."
Anxiety,a lesson about overthinking,"i wanted to share a lesson i learned today about how always imagining the worst can hold you back.

so since it’s halloweekend, i dressed up in my costume and posted a picture to my snapchat story. my ex boyfriend’s good friend, who i used to mess around with before dating my ex, responded to the post and complimented my outfit. this caught me very off guard as we haven’t talked in ages.

he then asked me if i had anyone dressing up as my characters bf in the show. not gonna lie, i was freaking the hell out. 

the overthinking naturally took over, and kinda put a dark cloud over my night. i was trapped in my own head, considering a million negative scenarios….. maybe he was pranking me, maybe my frizzy ass hair was overshadowing my outfit, maybe he was with my ex and they were trying to see my reaction, maybe he’s trying to hook up (which i am not interested in)….

i thanked him for the compliment and asked him what he was being for halloween. he told me that him and his boyfriend were doing a couples costume. i was shocked, and questioned further. he told me about how he came out as bisexual and has been happier than ever since finding his true self. this really struck a chord with me as i am bisexual as well. 

we talked a bit about our coming out experiences and he described how his friend group (my ex and his friends) had cut him off due to his sexuality. he wants more friends who can understand and relate to him, appreciating who he truly is. 

i feel like a total moron for letting my overthinking define my night. i was too concerned on the potential negative scenarios to consider that someone could have good intentions. 

had i let this overthinking control me, both he and i would have had one less friend we can relate to. i could’ve spent my whole night in fear of the possibilities instead of pushing my limits and being pleasantly surprised. 

i really know now not to judge an interaction by its appearance. just because something is a possibility doesn’t mean it will happen. 

overthinking almost cost me a relationship with someone great, so please remember this next time you’re considering taking that leap of faith :)"
Anxiety,I wish my brain would just be quiet,"This is my first time posting and I’m a little nervous about it, yet at the same time I’m just hoping I can find someone to understand.

I feel so alone with my anxiety, i don’t have anyone in my life that fully understands how debilitating this can be. Most of the time I’m just stuck in this confusion of “why?”. For example, “why can’t my brain just quiet down?”, “what is productive about this constant worry and fear?” and especially “why me?”. I know that I’m not the only one who deals with this but at times it can be so difficult to not feel like the world is out to get me, better yet my own brain. 

I just feel like I’m at a standstill, just a constant cycle of me trying to push through my life, trying to believe that I can do it all by myself. I wish I could go to school, or work, or even just go into any type of social situation without thinking about thousands of different things that can go wrong. To put it simply I just wanna be able to function “normally”, whatever that means. 

I don’t know how to get myself help, and I don’t really know how to accept it either. I’ve finally found a great therapist that really understands me, yet I know I need more. How do I do this? Even writing this down I’m scared of the silent judgement this post might receive just in the brains of the people reading this. 

If you did take the time to look this over, I would really appreciate any kind words in the comments, even if it’s short. Sending love to all of you!"
Anxiety,constant pain/discomfort due to muscle tension,"because i am so anxious 100% of the time, my muscles are constantly super tensed; in particular, i feel like i physically cannot relax my facial muscles and my jaw is constantly clenched on one side (and i’m sure it’s even worse when i sleep, which can’t be doing me any favors). i am always uncomfortable and/or in pain - pretty much all over, but especially in my jaw (and face in general?), neck, and back, plus constant headaches, sometimes migraines. seriously, it feels like it NEVER stops and i can never relax - at this point my “resting” face is a tightly clenched jaw and furrowed brow; that’s just automatically what they do.

does anyone else experience this and know of any solutions, or at least methods of reducing the tension/pain/discomfort? i’m only in my mid-20s and i already feel so decrepit and achy - and i can only imagine it’ll continue to worsen over time. the main solution i’ve come across online is to “reduce stress in your life” but like, how do you do that when you are biologically predisposed to a perpetual state of fight-or-flight? i’ve had pretty severe anxiety (general and social) for my entire life and i am so EXHAUSTED. it just never stops.

thanks in advance for any help!"
Anxiety,getting insane anxiety and dread from being around drunk people," Is anyone else like this ? I feel like I'm losing my mind even more bc it seems like I'm the only one bothered. But basically I cant stand being around drunk people specifically drunk men. Mabe it's because I'm a girl so I just always imagine the worst happening to me ?    


But just being in the same house with a guy (family member at that) that is wasted gives me this insane amount of dread...i am literally unable to sleep because I'm so scared. And I do not know why or the logic behind it because no single event has causes this? Like a drunk person has never done anything bad to me so idk why im like this.    


My brother keeps coming home drunk (2 days in a row now) and its Halloween weekend so I know him and his friends will be drunk again the next three days. And its really fucking with me. Today I locked myself in my bedroom and just blasted music to take my mind off it and calm down, but it's not working. And I dont think im going to be able to handle another 3 days of this.   


And it's not like I can ask him to stop. Like he should be able to drink whatever its his body.  But i hate feeling like this and i seriously think im going to have a breakdown tomorrow when him and his friends are over drunk again.   


Does anyone else experience this? Or have any tips to calm down ? I feel so sick with dread"
Anxiety,clorox bleach ..,"this might sound dumb but does anyone else get anxiety by cleaning with bleach ? today i was cleaning my bathroom and i used a lot of bleach because i was deep cleaning . now my chest hurts but i can’t even tell if it’s the bleach or my anxiety . while i’m cleaning i think about irrational thoughts like what if the fumes get inside my lungs and burns them ? or oh no i accident mixed my bleach with another (compatible) cleaning solution it’s going to kill me. as you guys can tell i’m stressing over this . and it happens every time i clean the bathroom ugh :/ i live in a apartment so there’s no windows near the bathroom to open just the ventilator. anyways i should go to sleep , if i don’t wake up , it was the bleach . 

 at least the bathroom is clean :))"
Anxiety,Neck hurting ouchy - anxiety is a real illness that can affect you physically,"The back of and the back sides of my neck hurt like hell especially when I'm really anxious that week. It hurt sooo bad today because I had a panic attack yesterday. 

I feel like it's probably due to a couple reasons mainly being the fact that I tense up there when I'm anxious. So I exhaust that series of muscles. Gotta get neck rubs and use self massage tools to loosen up the muscles. 

Just a reminder that my mental illness is valid and I need to take care of it since I am affected by it physically as well as mentally. Its getting worst as I get older too 😩"
Anxiety,Paradise State Of Mind podcast,[removed]
Anxiety,How is anxiety?,"When I was 18 I had clonazepam and prozac prescribed but witdrew because my parents coudl not afford it. After that I've been trying to go to therapy but never seems to work, it's hard for me to make friends and to socialize in general, because of this I've lost many jobs, Im 34, lost actually two different jobs in one month, Im about to be kicked out of the apartment I rent with a friend, the thing is that many times I've been suggested that Im just lazy and that I just take the easy way out, I can only describe it as feel a lot of fear but for nothing really. When I read the way people here describe their anxiety I can't relate that much to those experiences specially the breathing, I breathe normally but I just feel the urgency to escape no matter what Im leaving behind. Does anybody experience their anxiety like this?"
Anxiety,The worst situations for me,"I’m just writing this to see if others can relate with this because sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind.

So I’ve noticed a pattern for my anxiety, that being that situations where my level of control is vague are the absolute worst. I’m normally pretty well adjusted and cope well, but when those situations occur I feel so overwhelmed. 

Situations that are out of my control? Fine, that’s life, I go with the flow. Situations that are in my control? No problem, no matter the challenge.

But situations where I either have to wait or practice extreme measures drive me up the wall. For instance:

A) Health scares. I have an odd, vague symptom. Could be nothing, but could be horrible. Only thing to do is either wait or go through expensive and major evaluations to get clarity.

B) Flying. I have control to panic and leave the plane up until take off after which I have to just wait and suffer.

Or like this morning. My boyfriend left for work in the center of the city (Saturday/Sunday mornings are always the most restless because not a lot of people and all that is left are a few commuters and then some undesirable characters). He’s not really a big city person so he doesn’t always really exercise the same level of caution. He always sends me a message when he gets to his work safe in these situations, but this morning he didn’t. Then my calls/messages didn’t even go through to him. I panic and assume the worst and my choices are to do something frantic (call the police? What? I don’t know), or just assume it’s nothing and wait it out. Well I succumbed to my anxiety and called his office and through that confirmed he got there safe. I was morbidly embarrassed about my freak out (and still hate myself for it).

I just wish I could be more mellow in those situations, that my mind wouldn’t take me to the worst case scenarios, but then again I’m afraid that by being cavalier, something horrible will come out of it and then I will end up regretting not doing anything.

Can anyone else relate? Any advice how to learn how to just throw caution to the wind and let these moments slide so I don’t have to either make panic moves (that resolve the fear but at what cost), nor suffer for opting to be indifferent. 

I hate how vivid my mind is and how I’m able to look at the big picture too well sometimes. Makes me great at my own job, but at what cost."
Anxiety,Anxious to get vaccinated,"Deep down inside, I want it. I know I will be fine. But my anxiety is overtaking my thoughts. Whenever I hear people talk about it, my mind goes on a downward spiral of fear. That's why I try to distract myself from it. Right now, I'm planning to go to a psychologist and ask about it.

I'm scard because early this year, I really had a bad trip of marijuana and meds the following month. Now, my body is sensitive. But I know, my immune system is healthy and I don't really feel that there's something is wrong with me. All I know is my anxiety.

How do I get over this? I'm asking for people to re-assure me and give me advice. Encourage me. Thanks"
Anxiety,Please read🙏🏻🥺,"Every time I convince myself I’m alright, I always get anxiety attacks or panic attacks. I tend to hyperventilate I think when this happens. I’ll be sitting down playing a game with friends, and then I move around and can’t sit still in my chair, then I’d hyperventilate and breathe weird… 
Sometimes I can control it, sometimes I can’t. But when I hyperventilate I start to freak out and then actually feel like I’m gonna die on the spot. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety by my doctor. Same thing happens on highways , even at my girlfriends house. Her mom made food and I completely could not contain myself. Kinda had to let them know i have anxiety and shit. But recently I’ve noticed me getting to my older self which is good. But when I feel like it’s getting good, this panic happens. I feel like im right there with this whole thing of anxiety . I never thought I’d be like this . Its like I’m constantly moving around and when I stay still for 2 min I start to try to focus on breathing then end up feeling dizzy and scared. I just really am tired of this . I really want some advice on how to handle this anxiety and panic. I just always feel like I’m about to die on the spot, it’s very weird. 
Advice???"
Anxiety,Anyone else get these physical symptoms?,"Sometimes when i wake up in the middle of the night my vision is distorted like out of focus and it needs to focus properly which panics me and after a few secs it sorts it self out. When i am between sleep and awake i see flashes of light in random areas of my eyelids at random times when my eyes are closed. Also when my eyes are closed i see moving lines and shapes and loads of other weird things mainly when i wake up in the middle of the night and when i try go back to sleep but after a few secs that goes away. I am guessing that’s just adrenaline i don’t know unless it’s just my anxiety and stress i suffer with. I am on my 4 weeks of amitripyln 10mg to help with sleep and tension headaches and 20mg citalopram. I am gunna give it another 2 weeks and see if things get better. I just don’t want to see or come across any weird things, if i wake up i wake up, i just want to feel normal when trying to sleep."
Anxiety,I try to not check my story on Instagram. Do you check that who looks at them?,"I try to not check because I wanna that post stories on Instagram for myself, not anybody else.

Before the pandemic, I got movies, theaters, abroad travels and I posted them on Instagram Story. I didn't try to show my life as amazing. Just I wanted to share them and I did.

In this situation, Not checking is easy but there is an exception that hurts and causes anxiety.

When I love or care very much about somebody, I check that she looks or not. If not, I ask why. Especially, she posts a story on Instagram after me and does not look my stroy, I ask why double times and As I have said when everything is normal, not checking is easy. But, otherwise is annoying.

In the past, I checked every time when I had posted it but I understood It was bullshit. Because This is my life but nobody's.

Since the end of September, I've posted, and unfortunately, I sometimes checked that My crush looked or not. I know it doesn't matter but...

Anyway, Hope I do not check anymore.

How about, Do you check that who looks at them?"
Anxiety,Sudden wave of anxiousness. What to do?,
Anxiety,Listen here…please read,"I’m kind of tearing up while typing this. But I truly feel for every one of you. Past couple weeks I’ve been at maybe my lowest . I’ve broken down and cried, I’ve had panic attacks in front of my girlfriends family. Like it was fuckin embarrassing lol. But lately I’ve kinda been feeling like my old self again ngl. Don’t get me wrong I get the worst of worst attacks, like I’m about to die on the spot or something. But I’ve been feeling honestly decent tbh. Will prob have an attack again, but maybe I won’t. What if tomorrow is actually a good fucking day? What if I decide to hit some push ups , sit ups, take out my dog, maybe not sleep at fucking 5 lol. Point is, there is actually a peaceful light at the end of this terror. I see it. Happiness. And trust me man I thought I was fuckin down and out. Fuvk I even had a panic attack today, but it went away like usual. Please don’t quit guys I’m a 21 male and just want to help some ppl and also receive advice. I’m not gonna run from this anymore. I haven’t run from it. I want to learn."
Anxiety,Does anyone get super anxious when having to or wanting to describe yourself to others?,"I don't usually get anxious. I was more anxious a few years ago, most of the time.

Nowadays, only a handful of situations make me shake with anxiety.

One of them is describing myself. Be it for classmates, for friends/family members, for a dating app or simply to write a diary, I get really anxious.

What can I do to get over this? It seems a silly reason to get anxious, in my opinion."
Anxiety,How to stop getting so anxious about pregnancy,"This is a really new problem for me and I'm a little concerned. I've had anxiety for a while, and I'm going to group counseling for it, but it feels like my anxiety just gives me a new problem every few weeks. The most recent problem is being anxious about getting pregnant, and it actually affecting my health. I'm only 19, and I'm on birth control, but lately even thinking about the ""what if's"" surrounding birth control and pregnancy make me feel nauseous. It seems to happen around when I go to bed and my thoughts race the most. Within a few hours I throw up, feel better, and go to bed. This has happened twice in the past week, and I'm starting to be concerned. The first time I threw up, and the second time I didn't but I felt incredibly nauseous all night. I've only missed one pill, but it was way after the last time I did anything so I know I can't be pregnant, but the thought still makes me nauseous and anxious.  Why is this happening now when I was fine before? How can I stop feeling so sick just from the thought of my birth control magically failing me and I get pregnant? Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,How to get rid of tense feeling?,"For short my health anxiety has been the worst over the past month because of a swollen lymph node that showed up after bad acne, I had one panic attack after the other almost every day, my appetite was horrible mainly because of the fact the attacks triggered my GERD and shortness of breath. 

Eventually I got treated for my GERD, appetite came back and I'm feeling better than when it started but I'm still assuming that I'm tense. My shortness of breath feels like the sensation you get after you cry, it feels better when I'm distracted (i.e. Falling asleep, doing anything that requires full focus) which is my most worrying symptom. I always yawn and hyperventilate. 

I'm wondering if anyone who has experienced this found a way to lessen the severity of feeling tense and if anxiety symptoms can last for a while."
Anxiety,Extreme anxiety after drinking what can I do now to fix it,"So I rarely drink but when I do I have really bad anxiety and I also feel depressed for days sometimes longer. I know why this happens and it's why I don't drink. Last night I drank for the first time in ages and got really drunk. I just woke up (it's 10am) and I have really bad anxiety I don't know what to do I can't handle this. 

My question is what can I do to ease the anxiety?"
Anxiety,16 and depressed,"I have never made a Reddit post before but I found this forum and wanted to share my story. I’m 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them. Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don’t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I’m not the only one facing stuff like this."
Anxiety,Anyone else get this?,When i close my eyes on a night to sleep my eyes aren’t physically moving but not sure if it’s my eyes or eye lids feel like they are fluttering when i try sleep. Is that from being tired and not having enough sleep and just my anxiety and stress?

Anxiety,Worst months in my life (I need help comments),"First of all, sorry I'm not english native.

Hi to everyone, I'm 21 years old and going throught the worst shit that happened in my life.  
 My life is hell, I have problems since I was a kid because they bullied me, I hated school,  i was afraid because of this. But now after years that I finished it (3 years) I got problems with other shits that are draining my life  essence. In 2019 I got several and continous sleeping problems and Breathing OCD, that year was tough, but everything got worse this year.

I mean 2020 the year of the pandemic I was better, this year was being fine but in July everything change in my life, my problems were back and I couldn't resist them, I started to go to a therapist, and man it's really hard.

 Last 2 months are complicated but the last one, all october was one of a shit month, I feel i'm sick. Maybe you can help,  maybe some of you went through this. My emotions are altered as hell, like everything that happens to me is in 100% emotional-sensitive level. I have a terrible breathing OCD,  I feel like I'm fighting every minute that pass, but now I'm writting this because I simply CAN'T SLEEP, worst thing i'm afraid of sleeping but I want to sleep (today not even an hour, yesterday 4 hours, before yesterday 5 hours). I feel so lonely that I sleep with my parents even, so tough ´, so complicated maybe some of you  can help me.

I can expand my story if you want, thanks, god bless you."

Anxiety,Can anxiety cause persistent numbness and other symptoms? Health anxiety is kicking my ass rn :/,"So I have been diagnosed with social anxiety a few years back, and nothing else, but I do suspect that I have severe generalized anxiety disorder, or something similar that causes frequent worrying and distress. I'm also aware that I'm a very mentally unwell person, and very well may be dealing with other more severe affections.

I started getting depersonalization around 2 years ago and it has stayed with me 24/7 and taken a huge toll on my mind and body.

I'm also not able to get treatment or even see a doctor for anyone for this for a long time.

Needless to say, I'm a constant nervous wreck.

But something that's really got me scared now, is numbness.

About 2 months ago, I had some weird numbness in my back that didnt go away, and began to stress throughout my body, to my legs, hips area, arms, and even my face.

After a while, most of this went away or at least feeling returned a good bit.

But now I still have numbness in my eyelids, behind my right ear, in some spots on my back  and in 2 little spots on my hands.

I also been having weird circulation and weird sensations in my fingers.

This never goes away, but the intensity of these sensations vary, sometimes feeling returns a Good bit, and it just feels slightly numb, and then it can intensify a lot, and feel extremely lacking in sensation. 

I've noticed no muscle weakness or any physical disability in these areas, everything is working fine, and movement is a-ok but the sensation is just not there.

I have really bad health anxiety and I've convinced myself a lot of times now that I have brain cancer or a similarly destructive illness , which has really scared me.

It's just so weird because when I get anxious or panicked, or my stress gets bad or I'm having a panic attack, this all gets a lot worse, and when I focus on them they get worse too, but they still remain there, 24 7.

As far as I know if it was caused by a brain tumor, there wouldn't be any instances of feeling returning, or it getting better, and it would just be on one side of my body and limited to one small area. But my mind runs rampant.

I'm just curious if anyone has experienced this? 

Or more generally, if anyone experiences symptoms that last persistently even tho they're more calm than usual? 

This shits jus really stressful man my birthday in 2 days and I just don't wanna be be able to relax 😂😂😭"
Anxiety,Waking up early?,"Does anyone else not have an issue falling asleep,  but waking up early and not being able to go back to sleep even if you feel tired? It’s been happening a lot recently. I wake up between 5-7 am even on my days off and can’t go back to sleep. It’s like my mind starts racing and then I become super hyper aware of my heart beating. Does anyone have this or have any tips on how to maybe go back to sleep?"
Anxiety,What do I say to my friend who dismissed my anxiety?,"I just would like some help with some clarity in this situation. 

My close friend is anti-vax and has been worried as I’m booked in to get it Monday (NZ but yes I’m slow to get it because of my  anxiety, I am not worried about the safety and keen to get it)

He is very worried for me and so tonight was telling me some stories of peoples bad reactions, i just listen politely to this shit it’s not worth getting into as he is adamant. He described the adverse reaction of one particular person as extreme anxiety - he went on and described so so many more anxiety symptoms… I was feeling excited to say That’s how I feel every moment!! I went on to say those sound just like my symptoms from GAD. I was happy because my friend seemed to understand how bad the symptoms where in the man he described - he really understood how terrible it is. So I said now you know more about how I feel, he responded that it was different because that man had never suffered this before. 


If found that weirdly crushing, it was dismissive right?"
Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they're faking?,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and taken medication on and off for the past four years. Right now it's so bad even thinking about going in to work makes me throw up and I can barely eat. I tried to have a conversation with my boss about it and just ended up crying, hung up, and had a panic attack. 

And I STILL have this voice like ""You just don't want to work."" ""It's not that serious"" ""You're just super emotional.""

How do you guys combat that voice? This is the worst I've ever felt and it is constantly going in my head unless I distract myself."
Anxiety,Health anxiety is getting hard,"Hi, guys. Just posting here to see if someone has a story similar to mine. 

I got covid one year ago. I was stuck in my room for 7 weaks and I can say that that experience has been ruining my life since then. I already suffered from anxiety before, but after this episode, became worst and worst, starting to affect all fields of my life, from my relationships to my work. Particularly my health and my pannic of getting sick. 

Six mounths ago, I start to develop some kind of hipocondria, when I found an axilar node in my arm. In that time (even before going to my doctor), i was completely convinced that i had breast cancer, and my life was all around that. 
I went to the doctor, got some exams, and nothing was found. Just an inflamatory ganglion for aparent no reason. Since then, the nodule comes and go, so my doctor told me that could be some hormonal disrugalion, and send me to and endocrinologist (I did not had this appointment yet). 

The scary thing is that, one week ago, I found another nodule in the opposite arm. My world ruined. I became obcessed again, searching online and constantly observing my two arms. I dont know how to do anymore. All my friends tell me that i need to stop pannicking and that everyting is fine with me, and this is all my anxiety affecting my whole body. 

What do you guys think?"
Anxiety,Argument with a friend,"I was out with a friend last night before going to the cinema with a few more. We were walking and talking and everything was fine, until she mentioned about a new place in town that I talked about, in which I described to her wrongly. The place in question is a new gaming area.

I asked how did I describe it wrong, and she said from my description of the place it was going to be huge but in reality it was small to which I said but from my description I didn't specify what size it was so your own expectation disappointed you. So we got into a stupid argument to prove who was right, and I got a little bit stirred up until we shut down the argument because of how pointlessly stupid it was. Like who cares. But I was kinda cooling down because I got a little heated because I was told I was wrong and I gave a bad explanation of something I know I didn't. 

I get paranoid about how I describe things because I know I usually leave out specific details from some things, but I know I didn't leave anything out from that. 

So I collected another friend on the way to the cinema, and she brought up the argument and they both were ganging up on me saying how badly I described the place. And got on me how I said they were gonna have tables and areas to play other stuff, but when I actually said they were in the works. And how I called it a gaming cafe when they said it was a gaming lounge. Getting on my case about specifics.

So it got to me, and I just stayed quiet when I got to the cinema/bowling alley because I was annoyed and didn't want to say anything hurtful in my annoyed state. We played bowling before the movie and the annoyed energy got transferred into my bowling skills which carried me through the first few rounds, and they were all joking and having a laugh but I just couldn't get on that level with them. 

We go to the movie and we're sitting down to watch Dune. And the movie was good, but I just don't think it's my kind of movie. But I couldn't really focus on the film because I got a chance to be quiet and think. And then the anxiety kicks in of whether or not my friends think I'm smart or that they like to gang up on me and give me shit for things. Because it's not the first time the two of them have made me feel like this where I'm dwelling on a conversation I've had with them where they call me out and I'm left replaying the whole confrontation over and over in my head. 

At the end of the movie, the friend I sat beside thought I didn't enjoy the movie because he noticed I was sighing alot and just didn't seem to vibe with it. They were then saying things like ""Yeah I understand why you wouldn't like it"" kinda making it seem as if I can't enjoy that kind of film.

I don't even know why I'm posting here, I just feel like shit and anxious and like a grump. I feel like I'm just making a mountain out of a mole hill, but it's kinda set me off too... UGHHH"
Anxiety,Anxiety causing gastro problems for the last three weeks,I’ve come to the realization that my anxiety might be causing all my gastrointestinal distress this month. I had an actual stomach virus but then I gave a notice to my job because I got a new one. I’m very stressed about starting a new job as the other job is the only one I’ve had. My symptoms aren’t consistent either. Some days they’re bad. Some days they’re non existent. Usually I wake up to diarrhea and nausea in the morning that gets better throughout the day until it’s almost gone completely at night. Does anyone else get this?
Anxiety,(TW) Thinking about going on meds,"
TRIGGER WARNING!! This post talks about depression, suicidal thoughts and eating disorders. 

I had anxiety pretty much all my life. Even as  a child I would avoid social situations, and binge eat to cope with anxiety. I had extreme paranoia of leaving my house, never spoke up in class, had trouble meeting people, and I genuinely don't know how many times I cried when giving public speeches. I became aware of my anxiety when I was 14 and had a panic attack during a concert. Between 14-16 my anxiety got so much worse. I was depressed, isolated, obsessive, and aggressive. At that time my binge eating transformed into anorexia and bulimia. I basically hit rock bottom. I ended up seeing multiple psychiatrists. None of them could help me, mostly bc we just didn't match. It's extremely hard and EXPENSIVE to find a good psychiatrist/therapist that you get along with. I ended up giving up on therapy and my family also lost their fate in psychological help. They denied my requests to find a new professional. Psychological help costs so much so I never insisted. 

It took me about 2 years to get my ED under control. I never wanted to heal from ED bc it provided me a sense of comfort and security. It made me feel in control since I was never able to control my feelings and anxiety. It's been about 5 years since I started actively reading and researching about psychology. I specifically took courses in uni to help me along the way. When COVID began, I was keen to find and heal my traumas. I started journaling, doing inner work, and I was shocked by all that I'd bottled up. My mental health started improving immensely. I no longer starved myself. I started eating a balanced healthy diet, doing daily exercises, reading, journaling, meditating and implementing other rituals that kept me grounded. I've become extremely self aware. I am aware of my triggers, traumas, body responses etc. However, all the work I put into healing myself just doesn't seem to be enough. I am doing better but that doesn't mean I have mental stability. I still have anxiety, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, obsessions, compulsions and body dysmorphia. I know why I have these, when they are triggered but for some reason I just can't get rid of these mental issues. Especially in fall time my mental issues become so much worse. I am always very hopeful and happy during summer. I feel like there's something wrong with my brain chemistry, some sort of imbalance. I just don't feel like my mental health issues are solely trauma based. Because no matter how mindful I am, how much I take care of mysef, show compassion, I just can't have ease in my mind. 
My father's side of the family has a history of severe mental health issues. My father is bipolar, has anxiety, depression, OCD and eating disorders. I am very much like my father in terms of my personality, even the way we think is the same. I used to be against medication but now I feel like it's the only choice left for me. I can't live the rest of my life like this. I don't want to and frankly I don't think I can handle the turmoil in my head any longer. 

Can some of you share your experience with medication? Did it help you? Did you have side effects? Did you try everything before going on meds? Please let me know."
Anxiety,I'm having uncontrollable social anxiety,"Hey, I'm a 19 year old male. I was kind of extrovert when I was in high school, that is 2 years back. But I have gotten used to living alone during the lockdowns (I live with my parents but I barely left my room for a long while). This has taken a huge toll on my social skills... I'm not able to talk to new people anymore (if it is one person I don't really panic, but I can't deal with groups of people.) My college classes have been online untill now, so my batch mates meet up often but I keep coming up with reasons to not go..  I have become extremely insecure and I always feel people judge me... I actually started smoking weed to deal with my randomly triggered anxiety attacks and it really helped. But that didn't help with my social anxiety... I can't go to therapy because that would need me to open up to my parents and they aren't the kind who would understand this and even if they did they would get hurt and blame me or themselves and make a pointless argument about it... I am really struggling because everytime I tell yes and then I cancel in the last minute... This happens only with new people, I'm comfortable if it is a group of my old friends... Any suggestions on what I should be doing to improve my situation?"

Anxiety,Venting,Lexapro and dull aching headache!🙂
Anxiety,Muscle twitch,"Hello. i have asked the question several times but i am very nervous and scared. I have been struggling with muscle twitching for 1 year now it occurs in any part of my body. in my hands, fingers, buttocks, feet, scalp, sides. Almost everywhere !!! I would add that I struggle with extra anxiety, hypochondria, OCD, panic and dp / dr! I do not take any medication for these. I also do not take sedatives or antidepressants. That's pretty much the problem. I’m afraid something serious brain disease is causing this, I have constant compulsion thoughts about it. I don't want to go to the doctor just with someone like this already, please reassure me!"

Anxiety,I think I might have anxiety or something similar,"This is the second time I have been resiting for the college entrance exam. Even though I already was admitted to an university that is considered great in which I'm from last year, I still decided to try again and keep on preparing for this years exam because I want to get into med school (the education system here is quite different from the US and they award bachelor's degree in medical science.). Everything was smooth at first, but recently I started to lose concentration or make mistakes like copying the wrong numbers when solving math questions. And things go worse; I now have the problems that I sometimes can't read the lines in the books and I just can't process what the questions are even talking about (I have solved the same questions for like, 7 times before without problem, which makes the situation I am in right now the more frustrating.).
And thinking of this makes my heart rate accelerate and it's hard to breathe. My hands shake when I try to study, and I still can't focus on studying.
I think I've become stupid as I can't solve basic math anymore.
I don't know what to do and I'm really afraid of failing the exam again this year.

Sorry if this gives you a hard time when reading... I'm still learning English."
Anxiety,Ideas/Suggestions to get distracted when you're sad &amp; heart broken?,
Anxiety,advice please,Hello i’m 15 i’m diagnosed with anxiety and depression and im can’t stop thinking about school and obsessing over how to make friends. I’m been at school for 11 weeks and think that if i don’t have friends now that probably make any since it’s too late.  School is the only thing i think about and it’s so suffocating sometimes i just want to relax and not think about school. I was doing so good last week i don’t know what happened. i feel like i won’t know how to live my life and be “normal” again. Right when i wake up i automatically become depressed and sad thinking about how i’m wasting my life and high school years away and how lonely i am. I just want to be happy again
Anxiety,Kinda freaking out,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for god knows how long. On Prozac, buspar, and I have 4 pills of Ativan for when shit hits the fan hard. Lately I’ve not been able to sleep. Tons of tossing and turning, maybe getting 2 hours of sleep here and there.
I got prescribed Ambien for it a couple days ago, but it’s not working at all. If anything, it’s making it worse. I also have trazodone, but idk if I can take them together. That stuff makes me tired the next day too, which is just as bad
I’m just beyond frustrated and on the edge of a panic attack right now. I don’t really know what to do. I haven’t slept in a week. Any advice or help?"

What are some ways to help me break out of this habit so i’m not as nervous when it’s time to sleep?"
Anxiety,Anybody get a feeling that when good things happen to you something bad will happen?,"I have OCD and it fills me with negative thoughts 
Example: something good will go on in my life and it’ll be pretty consistent and my mind tells me it’s too good to be true and something will go wrong. It might be my lack of hope or general distrust in myself and the universe. Idk"

Anxiety,Can I ask you for help to find out which emotion I felt in this situation? Which Need didn't get met here?,"It's concerning a conversation I had with my friend.

He showed me something, and I answered to him:

Me: ""Oh, nice, i saw that in a livestream from (specific person)""
Him: I don't give a fuck about (specific person).

I do understand that someone can get upset about people they don't like. But I know that he likes or feels neutral towards this person. I didn't understand his reaction but I felt really upset and took it personally , so I stopped talking. I can't tell at all which feeling I felt or which need didn't get met in this situation.

Do you may have a hint or an idea what it was?"
Anxiety,I can’t sleep well anymore,"I feel more tired than often and can’t sleep more than 8 hours. After I wake up I feel scared and I start to become very paranoid.

Anxiety,My biggest regret in life,"When I was 19-20 I used to go on the unmoderated Omegle for hours and hours to jerk off for a total of 6 months.I have easily masturbated with over
500-600 women on there. I also used to record every encounter I had on there. It was a habit, as soon as I saw a naked woman I pressed the record button and started masturbating. The worst part
was when on 4-5 instances the girl told me she was 15-16 and my impulsive reaction was to press record because it was a naked person. I was so consumed by hours spent beforehand on the site getting horny that my brain just shut down. Then after 3-4 minutes I would see her face or some other indicator that would make me realise she was actually underage and I would leave the chat, or the girl would leave herself. In both cases I deleted the recording after and never kept any of them. 2 years from that I am seeing a therapist but I still get severe anxiety and depression that no one will forgive me for this and accept me into their lives. I am lost."
Anxiety,Has anyone had this happen,I smoked weed monday and it triggered an anxiety attack. Ive been having these anxiety attacks on and off throughout the day. 2 days ago my sleep has been almost 0. I have not been able to sleep the past 3 days. Im not sure if its because of the weed withdrawal or anxiety. Ive never been through this and im not sure what to do.
Anxiety,Tinnitus (ringing in ears),This issue started the same time my panic attacks started. Now when I’m anxious I get this ringing in both ears. Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night it’s like I obsess over it and in total silence it seems so loud.   Is this relates to anxiety?
Anxiety,I wish my brain could just shut the fuck up,[removed]
Anxiety,"Feeling so guilty, anxious and confused need some advice?","Over a month ago I went out with my friend we had a few drinks and decided to go to the nightclub to see what it’s like as i haven’t been clubbing for 3 years. I remember most of the night like when I went to the club and walking home I remember me and my friend talking to these people and I can even remember what the people were wearing and other small details I don’t remember much of the conversations though and I remember me and my friend dancing on our own for a bit and deciding to leave the club early as we felt tired and I felt really bad going out clubbing without my boyfriend. My mum said when I got in I seemed drunk but not overly drunk. I always get scared if I done something bad after drinking as before I use to black out and have done bad things like at the start of me and my boyfriends relationship I blacked out and a boy kissed me and I didn’t pull away, my boyfriend has forgiven me for this but I’m so scared if this happens again and I wouldn’t remember it or suppress the memory of it. My friend said nothing like that happened and we didn’t even speak to any boys but I’m scared if she doesn’t remember either? I keep having these memories of me dancing with someone or hugging them or even kissing but each time the memory changes to a different person and to a different scenario? I can’t sleep or anything in case I did do something and just suppressed the memory? Everyone keeps telling me or my friend would of remembered. I’ve recently been diagnosed for ocd and I’m waiting for therapy and waiting list is 7 months I’m not sure what to do I feel like I’m going crazy and that my boyfriend doesn’t deserve me I have this really bad guilt and keep worrying what if I don’t have ocd what if it’s just an excuse in case I did do something bad what if the memories are connected to something that did happen"
Anxiety,"I'm going to my first rave! Here's how I have prepared, and how I'm strategising for a good time.","I'm 22, and will finally attend my first real rave. I've never even been clubbing, so this is a totally new experience. I've had crippling anxiety since as long as I can remember, really, but now I'm medicated and in my prime!! 

First of all, I'm really really scared. I've already decided to not do any substances I'm unfamiliar with, and to kick my (old but constant) ED thoughts to the curb because not eating will mean hella anxiety and bad times. I want to have fun! I want to not think so hard about what's to come. 

My bag: a staple in my anxiety is prepping. I have a small crossbody bag that looks cool with my Halloween costume that contains all my necessary stuff. 

Contents: Two small candy bars for emergency energy, weed for emergency anxiety attacks, plenty of booze to keep me drunk (I'm a lightweight so I could fit plenty for me) a powerbank + charger cable, bandaids, hand sanitiser, earplugs, a case for my glasses and there's room for my headphones and my phone. I feel a little overpacked but It's necessary for my anxiety, everything is carefully planned for any situation. I just got off my period last week so there's no fear of that since I never bleed mid-cycle. I wanted to pack more things but this is all I could fit + I can't dance with a big bag hahah. 

I'm going with a friend who will NOT babysit me, which I'm a little scared about. He will look out for me ofc, but I'm going in fully dependant on myself. I'm going in costume which I feel very comfortable about, I love dressing up and I love Halloween. 

I'm really scared about making my way home after, but I'm trying not to think too hard about that. I have plenty of money in case I need to take an Uber, and the bus always goes to my station no matter the time. As long as I can get to station X I can always get to my home station, 24/7. As long as I can charge my phone I can find my way home. 

Going home is an issue for future me, and as long as I have my phone and my headphones I feel ""safe"". 

I feel so unhinged when I talk to my friend about my anxiety over this, since he's such a chill, go with the flow dude, so it's nice knowing some people might be able to relate.

Anxiety,It’s my one year anniversary of getting anxiety from malware,Hey guys. Today is the one year anniversary of my anxiety. This day last year I downloaded a bad malware onto my laptop and every day since then has been hell. I don’t even own a computer anymore but know I can’t help the feeing that whenever I use one I’m going to get a virus. I’ve tried to get help multiple times but most of the responses are “Just get a good anti virus” or “just reboot windows”. None of those help because even if my computer had no sign of a virus I will still be very paranoid. I know there’s other people going through this and I try reaching out and most don’t respond. I just want to get past this. This has been the worst year of my life and I don’t think it’s gonna get better. Until next year guys!
Anxiety,Guy trouble,"So this is something that’s been on my mind for a bit. I matched with this guy on Tinder I went to HS with. We didn’t talk, more just vaguely recognized each other. He seems sweet, but I don’t know if he means it or not. We cuddled and he asked for every little thing he did (first time we hung out). He wanted to kiss me, but I declined since I wasn’t planning on it being a intimate visit anyways. He just invited me over to chill while I was sick. I also told him a bit how I’d lost one of my siblings not too long ago, so I don’t know if that’s a red flag? Sometimes I also feel like texting-wise he just tries to cut it off with a lol or something. He did invite me to something again, but I just said maybe because it’s outside and it’s getting chilly. I do genuinely like his personality and I feel like we vibed, but please let me know if any of this sounds weird! I just don’t wanna rush in blind and get hurt. Either way, I will be careful. If it’s been a few months and I’m confident, I might be open to more. But right now, I’m just not there yet."

Anxiety,nothings the same anymore its too late,"i failed my friends , i made a promise in 2013 when i made all those improvements nothing would tear us apart , we wouldbt let anyone take us down , 3 years later i have an eating disorder ready to be locked up just before christmas day , my friend is homeless , drug sick , my other friend is pregnant and assaulted and has PTSD from childhood abuse and is in a shelter for young mothers at risk . my fwb demons got to her from her narcissist ex and we both drank and had a terrible toxic break up , everyone went down hill no body got better , we never made it to where we wanted to be . i did but im all alone , it feels like im in a ghost town / cemetery where all the memories were . i feel like a failure and theres nothing i can do to fix it ."
Anxiety,DAE get anxiety about anxiety-induced stomach aches?,"Anxiety isn't exactly known for being logical, but I feel like this definitely lives in the top 10 of Classic Anxiety Ridiculousness™. Does anyone else find that they live in a constant state of anxiety about the potential of getting an anxiety-induced stomach ache? This has been my life for the past few months and I haaaaate it.

One of my anxiety's favorite forms of manifestation is stomach aches, as I'm sure many can relate to. But these days I find myself getting SO worked up over the thought of getting a stomach ache. How debilitating it can be, how I'll be down for the count for hours, the potential it has to ruin my plans. I wind up giving myself a stomach ache about it! Self-fulfilling prophecy 😞"
Anxiety,What should I try?,"For a couple of years at least it’s felt like my anxiety has taken over my life.  I’ve dealt with varying levels of insomnia and I seem to constantly being on alert and my mind constantly finding something, anything to worry about.  It’s worse when I don’t have something to reasonably worry about.  I tried medication once but the side effects seemed to be as bad as the anxiety.  I’ve also had counseling in the past, but I tend to think of my anxiety as a medical and genetic issue.  A few years ago I was feeling better with regular exercise and better eating habits — and feeling positive about my future — but now because of constant stress and poor sleep I’m so tired and have muscles and joints aching that it’s hard to exercise regularly and cut back on junk food.  What has helped other people in a similar situation?"

Anxiety,Freaking out don’t want to live like this I need someone to talk too.,"So I’ll preference by saying every since I went to the dentist on Monday I needed to get three cavity fillings I’ve been in tight pain. Before this I was fine. There was one time I woke up to intense jaw pain. I took Tylenol and went bed the next day I went to the dentist and he said tight jaw muscles. He said it would go away and eventually it did. This was a year ago. Ever since then I haven’t had many problems if I open my mouth really wide it would feel tight tight the muscles and if I keep my mouth open for too long the muscles would hurt. Now after the filling and once the numbness wore off I was fine until the next day I started feeling tight cheek pain that radiates to the other side. I feels like a vice squeezing my cheeks and head. Or someone punched me and the soreness after effect isn’t going away. It’s been like this 24/7 till today. I took Tylenol nothing is making it go away. I wear a mouth guard at night. Ever since the dentist it got worse. I can’t handle myself right now, I’m going to see him again Monday. I just don’t want to live like this."

Thing is, i suddenly got very nervous, since as a not very social individual i havent gotten out much...what if my costume is not enough/too much? what if i bore people?

what im most nervous about is gift giving though...its technically her bday, but i also dont think we are more than acquaintances and thus dont know her likes very well. The only friend i asked what i should do started teasing me saying if i got her a gift she would realize i have a crush on her, so i didnt, but i feel guilty if i dont! I dont know what to do, I dont want to be rude nor straight up not show up out of fear, I havent panicked like this in so long :("

Anxiety,It does get better!,"2 years ago, I had my first panic attack and from there on everything went downhill. I suffered one year in silence, didn't get professional help. Finaly after not being able to do a lot of the things that I formely could, I broke down. I went to therapy and it was the best decision of my life. I now can redo all the things, that I could before my GDA. Life isn't as great as before, but its really ok. Some days it's even better than before. I'm glad for my therapist and that she believed that I could do it without any medication. The anxiety is still there, but most days it doesn't really bother me. I still have a long road ahead of me, but I got my optimism back that I lost. I hope and pray that all of you here will also one day know that infact, yes, it does get better."
Anxiety,Thank the absolute LORD for EMDR therapy!,"EMDR is a life-saver! Yesterday I  saw some disturbing images and I almost felt like I wanted to die after seeing them. Then I discovered EMDR.

Anxiety,"Trying to reframe my FOMO for gratitude that others can have fun and I will get there, too","A big part of anxiety for me is feeling like the world is passing me by, people are out doing the things that would be so overwhelming to me I just couldn’t imagine doing it.

So I’m trying to reframe those feelings with gratitude. That other people are capable of living their lives in that way, and when I do the work I need to do on myself, I can join in to. Like sitting on the sidelines, giving myself the love and attention I need while I cheer on others. 

I don’t know if this would help others, but it’s helped me cut down on the shame and panic about not being able to participate in life in the same way others can without anxiety. This also helps frame a positive future, where I can start to visualise myself enjoying these situations with others. 

What do others do to help this feeling of FOMO?"
Anxiety,Can’t sleep - so much anxiety about job decision. Advice or happy thoughts welcome!!,"Am I a jerk? Going back to Corp life..

I was hired at a startup about a month and a half ago. I wasn’t trained at all. Voiced concerns about just not being a good fit and tried to resign twice now. They have tried to find a new role for me, admitted that I was thrown in to a complete madhouse, offered WFH, and begged me big time to stay. After like an hour and a half convo I said ok without speaking to my wife. Bad mistake lol. This startup job is no WFH, getting home late every night (semi my doing bc I strive to be good), commuting, etc. when I said ok, i agreed to staying until after the holidays.

Well- I was pretty upset about everything and even very embarrassed. At the end of the day, it’s just not a good fit. I need to be home more with my family with a job that doesn’t require very high demands. I tried to spin it in a way to not call their baby ugly. 

My old boss has reached out to me and offered me my job back for basically the same pay. I feel awful bc I told this job I would try this “new job” before I had any old job offers. Do I stay here for a month to try to just help and then leave or do I just rip the bandaid off now? Also am I a jerk? I tried to tell them but I think I was too nice and it got me to stay when I really didn’t want to. I’m sick with guilt bc I’ll likely need to try to
Resign a 4th time. I’m just hoping I can meet them in the middle and not start the new job til early dec… thoughts/advice fellow anxiety sufferers??"
Anxiety,"I finally did it, after years!","I went to the doctor for my skin issue that has been my biggest insecurity for years, but I've never been brave enough to go to a doctor about it as it always seemed so scary, uncomfortable and awkward. 

Earlier this week, I walked all the way to the doctor without any makeup on to cover it, and that alone took a lot of courage and convincing. Today, I picked up the medicine for it from the pharmacy! 

I realized it was scarier to live this way, trapped and insecure, than to just get treatment for a health issue that shouldn't feel embarrassing to get treated anyway! I'm feeling really good about myself! Just wanted to share. :)

I hope this fits here!"
Anxiety,I always end up getting rid of money.,"I like to joke and occasionally moan about how hard it is to save and keep my bills paid and stuff, but in reality i’ve not really had trouble with bills this past year. I’ve made enough, and I certainly haven’t saved.

However, I casually misspend my money. I almost do it compulsively because i am scared by its potential and my own past excessive behavior with it (mainly regarding drugs, which I am thankfully largely over). Between occasional Twitch subs as thanks to people who genuinely make my life more tolerable to overspending on food and (this is the big one) lending money I don’t ever expect to get back, I’ve gotten rid of almost every single cent I’ve made in my life.

I don’t want people to feel needy like I have. I have a good enough life as-is but money is always a damper in my happiness, whether i’m giving it or receiving it. I couldn’t even borrow $60 from my sister without ending up feeling horrible as I try to pay it back because she lives in another country and giving it back to her has been an immeasurable headache. I hate dealing with money. It’s always a source of contention between me and the people around me, and I’m not presently in debt but I still lack the peace of mind I seek.

The biggest one is my mother. I give her more than half my income as rent and to help pay for bills, and I VOLUNTARILY decided I would pay her more because electricity has been going up, but she still demands most of my time and energy, constantly interrupting me at work (which demands my presence) and always asking me to do things she could do herself, verbally abusing me when I don’t comply. She then acts all sweet and caring when I DO indeed perform for her, even though she doesn’t realize (or chooses not to) that I only do it so she can leave me alone.

Money is a nightmare. I hate it. I feel terrible and, while I really deeply want my life to be more tranquil, I feel like I am still paying past dues for my horrible behavior in the past trying to adjust to life (unsuccessfully) as a settling adult. I wonder if I will die without having known peace from it."

Anxiety,Grown up Stresses while I feel emotionally 7,"I've been through the fucking ringer these last few months, damn near a year and I feel so emotionally drained. I've started and stopped sertraline because I thought I was having health anxiety but it turned out I was actually sick and the side affects of the medication were causing issues with my actual symptoms of sickness. My partner of five years nearly stopped dead in front of my eyes twice this year and I haven't had time to deal with that trauma at all. Topping it off this morning my son's bio mom hit me up trying to get him for his birthday in two days. She ditched him over two years ago and never paid him a visit, phone call, or a dime. Her and my boyfriend are still legally married because she never provided an address to subpoena in those two years. I've contacted an attorney but I'm too poor to even get all my required medical tests so I also have to apply for legal aide and it's a fucking nightmare to deal with. I'm at my absolute bottom here and the thought that she wants to pretend to be a mom now makes my blood boil. Emotionally I'm so not ready for this, I want my mommy and a blanket and to cry and cry and cry and instead I have to be a whole big grown up and I hate it."

Anxiety,Severe Anxiety Symptoms,"Before I start this, this is in no way representing others with severe anxiety or anxiety in general, everyone has it differently, and I’m not reprimanding them or making them less, I’m simply sharing my story.

Adding onto that, this post also isn’t to belittle other’s problems, everyone’s problems are valid, you deserve help.

This also is to say that these symptoms are not always anxiety, please check with a doctor. 

So, with that out of the way, my story starts when a stomach virus hit me in 8th grade, I think, hard to tell. I was severely nauseous and was not able to move or eat anything. What was bad, is that I had to go on a trip to New Mexico with my family that week, and there was no way I could stay home by myself. I tried to move but every time I felt so sick and I started to have panic attacks. We tried medication, for the trip, from nausea medication, which did nothing, to allergy medication, which made my heart race. Then, the day came that we had to leave. My mom has to be in the backseat of the car with me while I cried and had to fall asleep to get away from the extreme nausea and extreme heart racing. By this time, I hadn’t eaten anything for a week, so my parents were desperately trying to get me to eat, but all I could stomach was fruit drinks. We got to the hotel, and the whole trip was ruined for everyone by me being bedridden in a hotel room. The only thing that kept me sane was sleep and playing Animal Crossing.  Fast forwards and we finally got home, from there, I wasn’t able to go to school, I was barely able to eat (my weight dropped to 80), I wasn’t able to move, for months, I took so many blood tests and went to so many doctors and tried everything, until my mom finally convinced me that maybe I could try anxiety medication, since my doctor was recommending it so much. I tried, and started feel better slowly, I was able to walk. Got on another medication, and the nausea was gone. I was able to move and go back to school, eating hasn’t been easy, I’m not at the weight I want to be at all, but at least I’m not dangerously underweight. It’s all a work and progress to get to my best, even though it’s been 3 years, I still can’t eat like I normally could and I have panic attacks when I feel nauseous in fear that it’ll come back, but, I’m trying."
Anxiety,[Advice needed]how to reduce stress? its getting all over me and i cant study one bit due to it.

Anxiety,I'm losing it,"Yesterday has had to be one of the worst days of my life so far. On Saturday I moved out of my parents house to live at university halls, which I have being planning to start for a year now. The first day there I though I was doing okay and was trying to stay positive to try and enjoy it. The day after I woke up with butterflies in my stomach that lasted for about an hour until I calmed down, but later on during the day I was overwhelmed with thoughts and began having a panic attack. The Tuesday followed a similar pattern as I had my first lecture which I found difficult as I couldn't understand the task at hand and another student called me stupid. Then Yesterday was supposed to be a day for me to try and chillout and focus on my mental health, but something inside of me changed and just couldn't stop crying. Yesterday was the first day I believed that I would be better off dead then face these difficult challenges as I panicked and tried to ask for help where many were turning me away.

I'm now back at home with my parents and am thinking about quitting the university I'm going to do open university where I can study at home as I don't like working with other people and my parents can keep an eye on me.

I feel like an utter failure because I let things get on top of me and have decided to quit. To be honest I'm scared everyday and worry about my future as I can't go to new places without my parents and my anxiety and depression is out of control.

I need some serious help, I just want to be happy."

Anxiety,Health Anxiety And Worrying About A Nose Disease (M20),"For the past two years on and off I’ve had 3 periods of some really debilitating health anxiety. It started off after I got a septoplasty, which is where they fix your deviated septum. Before the surgery I read up online about a disease called empty nose syndrome. It was a real scary disease that a lot of people end up committing suicide from because of the symptoms it leaves u with. The disease is rare but looking it up it said it’s possible to get it a few years later, which is even more rare in its own. Most people that get it later will get it a year later or so but they’ll have weird symptoms right after surgery. I Talked to the doctor because I was so scared of that disease and he told me that he’s going to make sure I don’t get it which made me feel good at the time. 



To make this story shorter basically I just did a bunch of research and looked at the people who talked about the disease and they’re experiences etc. After this happened I had some anxiety but not much. Well since then Anytime I have a traumatic event or feeling this health anxiety comes back.  The most recent being the breakup of me and my girlfriend. She was so so so important to me and we dated for quite a long time. I remember after doing it I had just a giant fucking panic attack, one of my worst if not the worst.  Since then my Breathing has felt weird. Feels like I can’t breathe correctly through my nose and i end up breathing through my mouth and my chest is all tight and it just gets worse. It’s like my body becomes hyper focused on my nose and feels every sensation etc. Now i’ve dealt with this two other times yet I still am able to feel convinced i’m getting it.



I know the disease is rare and i know  it’s even more rare to get the disease unannounced years later but I still can’t shake the thought it’s awful. Just typing this out so feel like I can’t breathe and my throat feels tight and etc. It’s just awful because one of the symptoms of that ENS is feeling like u cant breathe but the reason for that is because the air in their nose feels to open with no resistance or it hurts to breathe or they can’t feel the air at all like they’re drowning in some way etc. I cant have this happen a third time it’s so damn awful."
Anxiety,Friends?,"When you go to school/work or even wondering in home, do you guys have need to have/make friends?

What happened before was I got lost in my own thought because of some triggers that makes worried sick, then I can feel my heartbeat and my hands shake terribly and my vision narrowed.

This happened a few weeks ago but now I just keep asking myself did it really happen or I’m just overreacting? Or worse, maybe I want it to happen? I just feel like I can’t trust my own judgement."

Thanks again for the welcome, a hug."
Anxiety,Is this anxiety or Rejection sensitive dysphoria? I can’t even live a normal life,"Hey guys, I am having a really tough time with my anxiety now. Always gets worse for me at the end of the year I’m not sure why. 

I am deathly afraid of any confrontation, so I let so much of shit slide. Basically I just ignore or act like something doesn’t affect me when it doesn’t. 

I remember last year I was sitting in my car, turned off and the guy next to me slammed his door against my car. I was so pissed and angry but I was too scared to confront him or say anything. After the “altercation” with me not doing anything, this anger brews in myself that I can’t even defend myself or my loved ones in the future if I am always like this, and that anger makes me so angry at the small stuff too. 

I tend to get very angry and worked up nowadays if I sense even the slightest sarcasm or attitude or anything besides 100% sweet and kind interactions which I expect for some reason. I can’t take any rude behaviour or any interaction that seems half arsed. 

I get so damn angry and depressed over the way I am being treated, and then I get depressed and angry over the fact that I am too scared to do or say anything about it, and the voice at the back of my mind says I’m not a man or I’m not normal. 

Has anyone else experienced this kind of mental torture? 

I am unable to do normal stuff people my age do because I fear these intersections and the subsequent internalised reaction my brain goes though. 

I need to apply for a job now as I’ve just graduated but I can’t seem to apply as I’m too afraid to get rejected for the job and destroy my already absent self esteem in addition to being afraid of the interactions that I would have to go though from the interview and during my job too

I am just a shell of a person now 

And I hope this issue is not forever. I have tried therapy but I couldn’t even do the tasks I was given because it was too hard for me to do, and that was just to call and talk to my friends over the phone, which I don’t do too"
Anxiety,Long term success for dealing with anxiety,"Like many anxiety has stole time away from my life. Months in fact, and I think I've seen it at it's very worst and I don't want that to happen ever again.

A change I will make is to make time to do things which help my anxiety every day, ESPECIALLY on the days where I'm NOT feeling anxious.

This is something I've neglected to do. When things are going my way I'll ride the wave rather than take stock of the situation and not get carried away.

So daily I want to take things easy, practise yoga, do breathing exercises, take more baths and walks (alone time!), eat less crap.

Hopefully that way I'm best equipped to deal with anxiety when it rears its ugly head next!"
Anxiety,Are you worried about something and have no idea how to solve it? Answer 7 questions and get the words of encouragement you need at this moment.,Link in the comments below 👇
Anxiety,Not to mention love !,"I am a girl (18f) and really not sure that I love a boy or not. But I have just wanted to Time pass with him and really did it. 
But recently I heard that he is going to be married. Now I am become crazy by thinking that I can't time pass with him anymore. And he will not pay attention to me anymore.

And I want to back his attention to me. 

I didn't say about my love to him and he has not done it also."
Anxiety,i hate it when teachers ask me questions in classes,"i have never any idea whats going on even though i look at them and listen to every word and i think they can tell that and i remember like 10 years ago a college professor who would just lecture and never really ask any questions and he just looked at me and asked me a question i had no idea and it just really makes me angry and same with this yoga class she does one of those ""what does yoga mean to you?"" BS questions where everyone has a corny answer and i cant answer a question like that i hate i life so much"
Anxiety,"I don't think I've had problems with Anxiety before, but I'm pretty i have depression, im not diagnosed. I recently started getting sudden anxiety attacks while in school. I don't want people near me. Is this an anxiety attack or something else?","Hello. It's quite common for me to feel uncomfortable about being physically close to someone, but i never really noticed it as a repeating problem, my instincts just solved it. By that I mean I would just leave the room when i feel a bit uncomfy. But on Monday I felt really uncomfortable while in class, i Just wanted to be alone, i hugged myself, went into the fetus position, and was just constantly moving away when someone walked near me. I really feared getting touched and really wanted distance. It was the first time this happened and i ended up just crying and shaking until it passed. Right now I'm experiencing the same, i really don't want anyone around me, but my friends are aware of this now and I'm more prepared so I don't expect it to get as bad as it did on Monday. I just flinched because my class mate moved their arm and they're within reach of me. I really do not want to be touched and I fear it a  lot at the moment. I wouldn't say I have social anxiety as I feel quite comfy with new people but atm I really just want to get away from everyone."
Anxiety,Little inconveniences can ruin my mental health for days and i don't now why? I am the only one?,"I've been feeling really depressed and anxious for the past week or so. I truly feel awful and i am always on the verge f crying because i have that much stress.
I always feel like this when a minor inconvenience  happens in my life and it throws me right into a worrying-overthinking-spiral that i cannot escape. Especially if i don't have the any control over these situations. 
For example, my bf's wisdom teeth need to be removed in 2 weeks and for some reason i have been a total mess since i knew. I really don't know why but i just can't stop worrying about things that could go wrong and i don't want to see him in pain. I know it sounds ridiculous but my anxious brain is making such a big thing out of it. I've had 3 panic attacks in the last few days just because i cannot get it out of my head. It makes me feel weak and ashamed tbh 😅
It's not that big of a deal and what about people who actually are dealing with much greater issues and worries? What must they think of me...
And If i can't handle this then what if something really major happens in the future? It makes me even more afraid, like if my bf ever got in a serious accident i would just die i guess. Is this even normal? Am i the only one? 
And how do i deal with these feelings? I know my thoughts are irrational but my feelings are still real. His surgery isn't for two more weeks but i don't want to feel like this for two more weeks. 
I also don't think that is the only reason why i am feeling so shitty but that was the triggering event i guess. 
Anyway, words of advice are highly appreciated &lt;3"
Anxiety,Brain zaps when angry/scared,"Hi all,

So I've experienced brain zaps before, when I've been coming off of antidepressants or missed doses but I'm currently on antidepressants and I haven't missed any doses.

Yesterday when I returned home, I noticed that the back garden gate was open which isn't possible because its bolt locked.

When I saw this, my body instantly starting having zaps up and down my body. I know that I had a rush of adrenaline, but when I turned my head or heard a noise or was coming around a corner, my whole body shocked from my brain to my feet. It was absolutely awful. It didn't feel like a normal fear response, like I said there was zaps up and down my body, it felt like the jerks you get when you're falling asleep and your body jolts.

Does this happen to anyone else when they're faced with a scary situation or threat?"
Anxiety,I miss when I used to not experience anxiety/stress,"I didn't really experience real anxiety or stress until I was like 19. I had a good upbringing with no traumatic incidents and had parents who were very lax, so I feel like there was literally nothing for me to care about. I had no concept of the future or responsibility. I remember my best friend had anxiety and I couldn't even comprehend what that meant and when my friends would talk about how stressed they were I'd be like ""why? just stop caring?"".

Then when I was 19 I moved to a city and started living alone and had to get a job of course. I feel like the reality of life hit me all at once and since then (I'm 23 now) it's never been the same. It's been particularly bad the past couple years. I can't smoke weed anymore cause I have panic attacks every time. I've not been drinking very much for months cause it sends me into an unbearable depression &amp; gives me anxiety.

I just miss how stress free my life used to. Sometimes I think back to how my brain used to think about thinks and process stuff and I wish I could go back to bring able to think the same way and not think so much about everything. Bums me out sometimes. Feels like this is just life now and I'm gonna have to live with this forever and I won't ever get back to the way it used to be.

In a way I'm grateful that I at least got to experience those 19 anxiety free years, but I just want it back so bad."
Anxiety,My anxiety gets so bad I can’t even focus on reading,"I can’t focus on anything, eat, drink, sleep. I try to read something and this horrible feeling comes over me of complete sadness and like something bad is going to happen. I am so desperate for someone to talk to I don’t even understand it 🥺"
Anxiety,Nice combination of anxiety and ADD,"Yeah, so. Imma tell you. I have this nice combination of anxiety and add and all my life, my parents and teachers got/get super mad at me, because I forgot to do something they told me 5 minutes, or even 30 seconds ago and I get super anxious about it and in the end of the day I feel like I'm gonna colapse xddd 
But most of the time Its just this funny ""I...wanted to say something...I forgot what it was...oh my god...wtf did I want to...Aaaaaaaaa....AAAAAAA"" and it actually makes some people laugh, so I don't mind it that much xddd But yeah, it's a fun combination that I wasn't aware of until recently, when my friend pointed out that I show all the symptoms of ADD and she was right it seems xddd

So yeah, just wanted to tell this to y'all, hope you have a nice day and remember, that I love you all!"
Anxiety,Please help me with my survey about travelling and mental health habits,[removed]
Anxiety,is this an extreme reaction?,"I took my first sertraline pill last night at 7pm. 50mg.
This morning I randomly woke up around 2am to the most intense panic attack of my life. I was so stressed and anxious she heard me say ""I want to die"" loudly as a way to expell what I was feeling from me.

I've spent the morning hyper ventilating, legs weak with a migraine and an intense weight in my chest. I called the doctor who said this should go away after a few days, but my family is concerned for me.

Here's the thing, I don't have anxiety all the time, I only get it in certain situations where my life isn't going well, yesterday I was feeling great, and this morning I feel worse than I've ever felt in a long time.

My family said I shouldn't take any more medication,  I'm inclined to agree, I have studies to complete and this is getting in the way. Right now I'm laying in bed trying to insulate myself from how cold I feel, I'm thinking all the worst thoughts about myself whereas yesterday I was fine. 

What should I do? This is much more intense than I was expecting"
Anxiety,My brain never shuts down,"Hey everyone,

So, my (21f) biggest problem in life is that Im never comfortable at doing anything. Even when im in the most perfect scenario, with people i really like and without nothing to worry, my brain is still stressing and being anxious for some reason. 

Even when im smashing drunk, my brain is still going on and on about why i shouldnt be there or why everyone around hates me (and im pretty sure they dont).

Whatever the circumstance is, I overthink every small thing. I just want to be in peace for a second so I can enjoy life, but i cant do it as much as i try"
Anxiety,Anxiety avoidance,"I'm suffering anxiety and my SSRIs finally started working, I feel normal again and able to keep up with my daily tasks. Except one thing, I really cannot push myself into stuff I love doing. I draw, and I'm also pursuing masters degree at Academy of Fine arts. Drawing is a must for me and also my biggest passion. But ever since my panic disorder and anxiety kicked in, I've been avoiding it to the point I cannot even be in the same room as my working tech (I'm a digital artist). I push myself everyday, but only after couple of minutes drawing something I'd otherwise enjoy, I start getting nauseous and my heart is going crazy. At this point I'm literally doing everything else beside that, I read, clean, and interact with friends and my partner, but cannot get myself to engage with my real passion. Does anyone has thoughs on that? :)"
Anxiety,General anxiety,"I'd like to say that most days my anxiety is under control, or low. But then there are those days where EVERYTHING makes me a worried wreck. 

Right now I'm stressing myself out over a Dj-gig I have together with a friend in three weeks.  Yesterday my brain also decided to remember a few stupid things the bf told me years back, which makes me feel insecure today for some reason. 

Never mind why, right? It doesn't really matter what it is, the anxiety pops up regardless how small or insignificant. 

I'm just not quite sure what to do with it. What do you guys do? Do you shut yourself off from the world for the evening and just try to stabilize? I tried to meditate, but yeah, still sitting here with anxiety. 

""This too shall pass"", I just get so angry at my brain when it does this. What could possibly be the purpose of grabbing onto one of the few mean things the bf has told me during our 8 years and obsess about it? (I'm sure he didn't mean for it to be mean, hes a good guy. Its just another example of a mind obsessing about some random thing in the past really.) And I KNOW the gig will be fun, just got to suffer through the three weeks of agony beforehand? Fucking sucks."
Anxiety,My first meds have started to kick in this week.,"I was told beforehand that they are likely to make things worse before they make them better, so this isn’t a surprise. But I’m now on my third consecutive sick day from work staying underneath my covers because I can’t handle thinking about anything else. I’m freaking out and I hate it."
Anxiety,Moving from a high-rise to a freehold and it's causing me so much anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this? I get nervous at the idea of living on the ground and feel so vulnerable. Everytime I see the new house my brain distorts.,
Anxiety,I can’t leave the house,"My anxiety has been so horrible this week. I had to quit therapy b/c I found out my Medicare type doesn’t cover it. I thought it would be a smooth transition but I’ve never felt so much horrible anxiety. That and other factors of life are making me so anxious to the point where I can’t leave my house. I can’t go to school because the thought of being anywhere that isn’t my house sets me off. This morning I was crying and hyperventilating because I was about to leave the house and walk to the bus stop but I felt paralyzed. Like even the thought of touching the door handle scared me. I know it’s my brain making the world seem scarier than it is and I know it’s irrational but I can’t. I can’t explain it well. I can’t imagine existing outside the world I’ve already made for myself inside home. My dad asked what I was wrong he was practically begging me to tell him what was wrong but I couldn’t tell him. I, myself, can’t even pinpoint it. I’ve missed school yesterday and im missing today as well . I feel pathetic. I feel burnt out to where I don’t even want to speak. I feel horrible."
Anxiety,Body acting weird,Literally 3 minutes ago I was about to sleep then all the sudden my legs randomly started to feel weird. Like electricity was running through them. And I feel a weird needle like pain on my feet. That sensation lasted for about 10 seconds. The needle pain happened twice. It’s scary to me. Yesterday I had an okay day so now after this happened I’m feeling like I’ll just be anxious for the next couple days.  It’s 5:42am for me now.  I have health anxiety so anything weird happening in my body I automatically think I have something wrong with me.  I’m very scared it’s something bad. I also am scared of doctors.  I’m just scared 🥺🥺🥺 why are my legs feeling weird. Imma cry
Anxiety,Anxiety induced insomnia,"My anxiety started in in August and has progressively gotten worse. I always feel a rush of adrenaline in my chest when lying down. Now, I've been told I suffer from depression as well. My sleep disturbances started late August waking up a few times but able to go back to sleep. a couple of weeks ago I having trouble falling asleep. When I start to doze off my body would experience hypnic jerks and I would jolt awake. I would end up staying awake the whole night. I am unable to nap. I use a sleep aid so I can sleep and function during the day. I meditate daily, practice living in the present, exercise. Nothing seems to help.

My doctor prescribed Lexapro to treat my anxiety and depression. Would the insomnia subside if I can get my anxiety ad depression under control? Or do I need to see a sleep specialist?"
Anxiety,Dizziness,Does anyone else get dizzy? And does it come on before anxiety?? Or during??
Anxiety,Constant anxiety has made me look different almost sick.,"I don't know if anyone else suffers from this. But I will look in the mirror on some days and think 'geez you look like your dying' I've lost weight these last few months (not underweight) and I think I look paler....

My weight just shocks me cause I haven't been this weight in almost 4 years! And I'm already super pale to begin with, and I haven't been going outside ever... 

BUT my anxiety is a bitch and when I'm looking at myself, it repeatedly tells me 'your dying. Google it I bet it will tell you the same thing'

And it makes me even more anxious when my family randomly shows up at my house and all I can worry about is 'oh god they are going to think something serious is wrong with me' (which they never do. They always tell me I look the same lol) 

I just wish for a break. A normal day would be wonderful."
Anxiety,Throwing up due to overwhelming anxiety.,"I’m 18 years old. For the last 9 months I’ve woken up in a shear panic attack that would last for a few hours if I was lucky. Within the time I wake up to when it’s over, I sit on the bathroom floor and violently throw up. I’m balling my eyes out, not wanting to be here, not wanting to continue on with it. I can’t breathe or talk, and I’ve been getting help. I was put through c-pep a month ago and shit just doesn’t get better. I’m finally trying to open up again, meet someone new. And I have, in fact I’m supposed to be seeing her tmr and stay the night. But all I fucking do when I think about it is throw up. Which makes no sense considering I want this more than anything. It’s completely ruining my life and I just need someone else, who also vomits from too much of one feeling to just help me out. Please tell me something I don’t know. I’m just exhausted.."
Anxiety,Fuck extrasystoles.,That's all.
Anxiety,Scared to take medicine,Hey everybody! I went to my doctor on Monday and he gave me some etifoxine (stresam) to take mornings and evenings to help with my anxiety. Once I got home I started researching this on the internet and I've read a lot about how it doesn't do much and gave people very bad (and quite dangerous) effects. Now I'm scared to try it in case it makes me sick. What should I do?
Anxiety,Agoraphobia,"I'm about to go out and I don't know how to deal with it, i already have stomachache i dont know what to do"
Anxiety,Had two panic attacks in a row with my heart pounding thinking im dying,"And guess what? Went to the ER everything checked out. I am actually a little bit thankful that I did have these two attacks in a row because it really tells me that after all these physical symptoms and me thinking it’s a heart attack that it is quite literally me just getting myself worked up. 

Onwards and upwards!"
Anxiety,How long does it take for anxiety to damage heart?,Title.
Anxiety,"Do anyone else feel like there is an ""air bubble"" in your throat? And when you swallow saliva, it feels like it is going up then down. Is this anxiety related?","Do anyone else feel like there is an ""air bubble"" in your throat? And when you swallow saliva, it feels like it is going up then down. Is this anxiety related? Hyperacidity and acid reflux runs down in my family both sides and I have it too. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. Can this be caused by anxiety or acid reflux? I also had been in an anxious situation a while ago. 

Any tips or techniques to get rid of this sensation?"
Anxiety,I can not do this anymore.,"This physical pain. It's like there's a boulder on my chest. There is a knot in my stomach. I don't know how to make it go away, I'm so exhausted. I can't cry. I have forgotten how to breathe properly. I can't, I just can't anymore."
Anxiety,Climate anxiety is very much real to me,"I'm a 22 year old from Brazil, have been diagnosed with anxiety when i was 15 and i take medicine for it. The last year or so i've been struggling with climate anxiety, which is something most people don't take seriously or maybe ignore it because they can't change and fix it, i'm not sure. But i've seen my mental health decline loads in the last months due to it. 

Every single time i see a dead wild animal, bees for example, i feel actual sadness and deep anxiety. When i turn on the TV and watch news about wildfires in my country (caused by people) i feel so angry and frustrated, and i cry. Sometimes my day is completely ruined by climate news and i can't endure seeing wild animals dying (not domestic animals, i mean actual forest animals). Around may this year, a biome called Pantanal in my country was severely devastaded by wildfires and everyday i would cry knowing i could do nothing about it, i feel powerless and so much frustration.   
Can someone here relate to me? I don't want to read people saying ""well thats the world now lets end capitalism"" because even tho i agree, that is not something i can actually do and it's not going to help my anxiety unless capitalism ends tomorrow, you know? I know there is no easy solution for my feelings but i would like to hear from people who feel the same."
Anxiety,Comfort chat,"Hey. It's early evening here and anxiety is playing up. Chats open to talk about anxiety, depression, life, movies, anything."
Anxiety,Anyone here working night-shifts?,"I am looking for some insight and I want to know how you are dealing with night shifts and how it has affected you. I've been working a strange schedule for the past 5 months.  


Week1: 08:00-17:00  
Week2: 15:00-00:00  
Week3: 18:30-03.00  
Week4: 00:00-08:30  


This has been my rotation."
Anxiety,Need some immediate advice if possible (lots of anxiety),I’m in Boston and have to drive home but I’m extremely anxious to get in my car and be in traffic and have no escape and all of that…. Like I just need to get out of the city qnd need quick advice on how to do it. Getting here was insanely tough
Anxiety,Tongue tightness/tension/awareness,"Very aware of my tongue

Almost like I'm clenching it and it's tired/stiff

The more I try to relax it the more I tense it

Any experience of this as an anxiety thing?"
Anxiety,I’ve been doing really well but this week I’ve been getting anxiety spikes out of nowhere or over small things,"I have been doing so well lately and suddenly I’ve been getting anxious over things That use to worry me but I’m kind of ok with now, or waking up anxious.

Seems to get worse because before it was only over social situations and now it’s over random stuff"
Anxiety,Should I be concerned about Wellbutrin?,My dr wants to add Wellbutrin to my already existing Zoloft. I know this is a popular combo but she mentioned something about it lowering the seizure threshold and I’m scared to take it now. I’ve never had a seizure but I’m afraid I might if I take it.
Anxiety,My coworkers are making me self conscious without meaning to.,"I think because of them speaking a lot on my appearance I'm getting more stand-off-ish. I don't know what to do because I genuinely don't mind them wanting to give me advice or voicing their opinions but it's making dread this job more or even just hate looking at myself more. I'm beginning to get a little nasty too as a defense mechanism and I know that's horrible. Their hearts are in the right place, maybe? I hate being so overly freaking sensing and having no real people skills."
Anxiety,Finally had a breakthrough about my thoughts for almost two weeks: I was ruminating,"Hi! A few months ago (like three), I finally accepted that I have anxiety after a two years of being in psychiatric treatment for suicidal thoughts (which I left behind, thank you very much) and after a lifetime of feeling sad and overwhelmed with life. It was quite liberating and realizing that thoughts are jyst thoughts, that they aren't real, lifter another weight off of me.

The thing is, like every overthinking anxious person, since last Monday I was thinking over and over, worriee about the songs that cross my mind, about memories that appear when something in the present reminds me of a past memory. It started making me feel terrible, especially because I had already felt that way a previous week. Meditating yesterday, I realized I had gotten scared of my thoughts and of feeling anxiety. And on, and on I went analyzing my thoughts (you can guess where I'm going with this).

So, a few minutes ago I read [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/08/19/7-science-backed-ways-to-get-out-of-your-head/?sh=12a1beef3273) article and ugh, I finally realized that what I've been doing all these days is RUMINATING over my thoughts. I was so in my head trying and trying to manage them that it became an obsession and made me feel terrible and anxious. I already knew about rumination, but I thought it was about thinking about a specific problem, but I realize it is about analyzing your thoughts too, how and why you think things. I guess, thinking too much over stuff it's damaging and in this case, it really was.

Today, I'm going to see my psychologist so I'm going to tell her about all this. I hope that this breakthrough can finally help me feel calm after almost two weeks of terrible anxiety. At least, right now my heart isn't racing or palpitating, and I'm feeling calm. Wish me luck for the rest of the day. Thank you for reading my story 💕"
Anxiety,Wish me luck guys im really scared,Currently at my neuro ophthalmologist appointment bc of my optic neuropathy I'm scared right now that they had to calm me down I calm down a little bit but a still anxious as other said on here that it's probably diabetic related I hope their treatment bc I don't wanna go blind.
Anxiety,OCD vs GAD?,"

I’m struggling to differentiate these, they share a lot of similarities. I overthink every little thing and constantly stress 24/7 even I have things under control. It’s been causing headaches and neck pain a lot because I stress so much and my head feels dizzy. I worry a lot about finances, my health, family even though I know everything is under control I just can’t stop these ruminating thoughts. I’ll spend hours “researching” things on google until I’m satisfied with the results, then I’ll just do the same thing the next day. I can never relax, I’m always stuck in my own mind. I can’t enjoy time with my family and friends I’ll just sit on the couch for hours with these obsessive thoughts and every time I’m away from home I’ll get extremely anxious because I can’t look up these things. Please if you have any feedback I’d love to hear it. I can’t take much more of this."
Anxiety,Never ending oanic,"I get panic attacks when I’m alone—like  blind hysterical panic and it doesn’t end til I find people. I’ve tried meds and therapy for years but I still can’t do stuff like driving in rural areas w no quick access to ppl via shopping centers or whatever. 

Im afraid I’ll never be able to live alone and that if I do find myself alone and panicking it’ll reach the point of zero thinking ability, just running from panic thru the woods. 

I’m exhausted and feel stupid and ridiculous but it’s so far beyond anxiety attacks, jsut full on flight response w no thinking"
Anxiety,Suggestions for anxiety regimes,"I have PTSD as well as depression/anxiety. I take 300mg venlafaxine, 20 busprione, 10 mirtazapine daily as well as clonazepam daily. They used to get me through but everyday at the moment is a massive struggle. It's a huge wait to get in to see my psychiatrist so I have to make do with my gp. Does anyone out there know of any medication I can suggest to my doctor that might help?
I go to therapy weekly and have plenty of tools to help but they aren't cutting it at the moment"
Anxiety,Just received an official diagnosis today of anxiety.,"Essentially, I have been an individual with some form of anxiety throughout life. Attributing it to my dad's anxious personality and parenting methods (Partly). Well after coming down with some severe COVID my doctor is saying I have some form of anxiety that is manifesting in panic attacks.


I've been just browsing new jobs and applying. Every once in a while I see the disability waiver that you have to sign. With anxiety being on there. I'm curious if anyone has said yes to that and what the outcome has been?"
Anxiety,Any of you have bouts of excessively needing to clean the house but it never feels clean and it’s just really upsetting for some reason,Makes me not wanna try. Then it gets worse. Then I feel worse. Fuckkk. Why do I care. I never have people over here anyways.
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"When I’m around people especially in crowded hallways I feel like I can’t breathe. My throat feels like cement and it starts getting really tight and feels like I’m suffocating. At first I thought this was claustrophobia, but i’m coming to realize I get this in situations other then in crowded places.  Like I usually spend most of my days at the library in my school bc I have a weird schedule and have a lot of time to kill, and sometimes these girls will sit at my table with me and I start getting the feeling again. I start freaking out a bit because I know I need to keep my breathing down or they’ll think I’m weird so that kind of gets added onto everything. Sometimes ill even be in a vacant hallway and I’ll see one of my teachers/coaches and get the same feeling. I’ve had this happen to me ever since I was in middle school (maybe even a little in elementary school.) I also have a whole weird thing with eye contact, like I don’t really know how to keep it. When someone looks at me my first instinct is to look away, and I usually don’t know how long I should be looking at them when I talk to them."

Anxiety,I don't deserve anything good that has ever happened to me.,Why does life give me so much anxiety?
Anxiety,"Silent Anxiety? No panic, but debilitating tension in chest"," Hey Guys. Any advice would be appreciated. Since my early 20s I have had some sort of anxiety. It started as mostly panic attacks. I'm 40 now. I have figured out how to suppress the panic attacks over the years and the worst I get now is edginess with a slightly elevated heartbeat. I don't love it but I can live with it. Recently I haven't had the edginess but my body has been having issues.

Generally my body is tense. I get pain in my neck and shoulders, chest, and joints. Recently I have been having a tightness in my chest making it hard to take full breaths. I have also been having on and off lung pain. The lung pain is like when I jog in the cold and the cold air hurts my lungs. Been going to the doc and we thought it was GERD. I have been on meds for that for several months now (PPIs). Heartburn has been better but lung issue and tightness are still there. Doc sent me to gastro doc, gastro doc says this isn't GERD, go to pulmonologist. Likely it's a lung issue. It's going to be several weeks before I see the pulmonologist. Reading around online it appears like this could all be anxiety. Docs don't think I have any huge issues as I am in reasonable health otherwise.

For stress I have been trying to walk, run, and exercise often. And I am eating healthier. This has had the opposite effect. The other day I took the dog for a hike and I could hardly breath, it wasn't asthma, I just couldn't open up my chest to get a breath. I was surprisingly not panicked and just tried to calm down. I had to get home and sit for a half hour before it mostly passed. I have been experimenting with tryptophan to try and relax and I have seen some good results. The first time I took it I told my wife, ""I can breathe"". But it has started to work less and when I upped the dosage I started getting bad headaches. The lung pain and chest tightness generally happen when I drive, exert my body, and later in the day. Caffeine and alcohol relieve the issue, but I hate using either as a crutch.

I really hate dealing with this and I hate that being healthy makes it worse. Generally exercise really helps my anxiety but in this case it makes my issue worse. I would love to hear any successes any of you have had with a similar issue. I have a very busy life running a business and have young children. Oh, and in my 20s the only med that seemed to help my anxiety was Paxil. It had terrible side effects and I vowed never to take it again. Getting off of it was terrible too."
Anxiety,Conspiracy theories are literally causing so much anxiety/ Tik Toks algorithm sucks.,"Ah okay so with tik tok and YouTube shorts I sometimes stumble across conspiracy theories. I usually don't care about them, I find them interesting and just go on with my day. 

Well yesterday I stumbled upon one that relates to me specifically and I'm freaking out. Apparently I have Sanpaku eyes(my iris doesnt touch the bottom) and a lot of people think that's a sign of a curse/ early death. So here I am sitting in the library at school freaking out about my impending death.. and to make things worse death has always been a big cause of anxiety for me in general(I literally slept in the living room for half a year because I was afraid I'd die while sleeping and nobody would see me in my room thats away from all the other bedrooms)and now it's worse.. I know this is a a fake theory but just seeing all ths ""evidence"" of people with these eyes is just freaking me out. I've always been an anxious person but now I'm just in a constant paranoid state. 

So in conclusion, I hate tik tok and I hate people who make these videos. And I hate anxiety."
Anxiety,"I want to travel so much, but anxiety is getting in the way","I've traveled a lot and I consider it a significant part of my life and it's all i want to do. But anxiety is a feature of every trip i go on. It's gotten so bad that I've bailed on a good few trips now, most recently today. I'm feeling a little demoralized as i come to terms with the fact that i might struggle to do the thing I love forever.

My anxiety is caused by the fear of being anxious. I'm anxious about being abroad and not being able to calm myself down because I'm away from my familiar settings. It's especially bad after COVID.

I'd just like to know that there's hope for me, before COVID i was planning a trip to central Asia for a few months and today I bailed on a short trip to France"
Anxiety,Cardiophobia after eating,"Hello, 3 weeks ago I got into an accident from playing sports, I basically played for 3 hours straight and was dehydrated, so I thought I was gonna pass out or something. Then after I got checked and everything was fine with my body, I went to eat a heavy meal and I got a large panic attack in which I went back to the hospital and they told me it was an anxiety attack. After that there was just an \[imaginary\] scar there, and after eating another heavy meal a few days later, I got another panic attack. I found that I just instantly correlated food to panic.

This impacted me so much that I became extremely against eating anything that looked unhealthy or anything that is a large portion because I was scared it would give me a heart attack or something. The reason why I correlate my eating anxiety to my heart is because I talked with nurses and checked online and saw that acid reflux and stomach issues could mean a heart attack, yeah that freaked me out a lot, especially since I've felt weird things in my heart since I was a kid (but every single test they did on me, I was perfectly normal). So now any sense of chest pain I feel, I become very worried. I do not want to eat anything unhealthy, and the thing is I'm an 18 year old male that is fairly healthy, I didn't exercise much, but I still did exercise and I barely ate fast food and my go to drink was always water.

Additionally, I just got to college, it's 2 hours away from my home so it's not bad but now whenever I feel anything weird that doesn't feel right, I instantly buy a bus ticket back home to stay the night. I also hate sleeping in college, I don't sleep, I get lots of sleep paralysis and dreams where I feel like I'm awake but I can't move. I also feel something in my chest after eating anything, especially when I'm alone. I just want this nightmare to end, now I kinda feel ""depressed"" \[I wouldn't really say depressed but extremely unwilling to be in the college campus\], and I'm even thinking of transferring to a closer college or switching to a major that is 100% online. It sucks that this is where I'm at, I know this all wouldn't have happened if I just didn't go exercise that night, but I guess everything happens for a reason.

I wanted to get this feeling out of my chest and hopefully get some advice, that's why I type this, but of course, I still feel something weird in my chest .\_."
Anxiety,"My wife and I are both pregnant, she has anxiety. Help!","My (F35) wife (F40) and I have been trying to have kids for 2 years. She's been pregnant 3 times through insemination/IVF. The first two pregnancies resulted in early miscarriages and the third one in a traumatic abortion after we'd found out the baby had brain damage and would not survive. This was 10 months ago. 

Now she's pregnant again, and she is suffering from crippling anxiety. She can't sleep because she's scared she'll have to do another abortion so she got sleeping pills from a mental health institution yesterday. She's also taking anxiety medicine that are ok to take while pregnant, but they're not really doing much (she's been taking much stronger medicine since she was a teenager). 
She's also on a sick leave because her job was too stressful but due to start again part-time next week.

I try to support her but it's like talking to a wall. I take her out on walks, to restaurants and cafés, on a long-weekend trip, and we are also starting couples therapy next week. But I'm really worried about her because she just seems so empty when I talk to her. Do you have any tips on how to support her?

My other question is about I could better cope with her anxiety. We got pregnant one week apart from each other and I'm not allowed to be happy about it in front of her. For example, we got loads of hand-me down baby clothes that I eagerly started washing and sorting, but I had to keep them out of her sight and couldn't talk about them. There was no celebration when we found out I was pregnant, only dread from her side. She says she is going to be jealous if her baby dies and mine survives and she's worried she won't love my baby. Since I'm going to love any kid that comes into our family, I did offer taking her embryo and carrying her baby MANY times, but she refused. So I decided to also become pregnant myself because we are SO ready - we've been living in a house with 3 empty bedrooms for 2 years. And, I'm also getting old so I just wanted to make sure we're doing everything we have in our power to start a family. We didn't think it would work for both of us at the same time, but here we are. To be honest, she reacts to every little change to her life with dread and anxiety, and I don't know how to cope with it. She wanted to buy a house with me and when we did - she was apathetic and kept crying. She's been wanting kids her whole life and now that she has 2 on the way she needs more anxiety medicine and I can't reason with her. 

Since this sub is for people with anxiety, I was hoping to find some understanding and a little bit of help with how to cope."
Anxiety,This is the worst!,
Anxiety,My bad,"First time posting ever so forgo any slip ups on my part. About a year ago I started having light headed ness after or during a workout. 31m descent shape so I know I wasn’t over working. Light headed ness would last through the drive to work, some days to the point I thought I would pass out while driving. Then one night while working late I simply passed out. Went straight to the er. Nothing was wrong with the battery of test only thing they could tell me was I was dehydrated. Well that’s hardly the case I drink at minimum 3 Liters of water daily. I’ve always felt that was a cop out of most e r in the area, if we can’t find the problem it’s got to be dehydration. Got a fallow up the nest week with my dr. Had test ran turns out I was extremely low in testosterone and vitamin D. I was also prescribed a light dose of anxiety medicine to get me out of my head. However, by that time my driving and only driving anxiety was through the roof. Now if im the only one in the car im good for maybe a 5 mile radius. Any further I just feel like I’m going to pass out. If I have someone in the car with me I’m 100% to drive all day (mostly). That was about 4 months ago now I have anxiety in all parts of life, so I decided to come off my anxiety meds to see if that was the cause. Hopefully it will just reverse back to only driving anxiety. Anyone else ever feel like this?"
Anxiety,It’s like my brain is looking for something to be anxious about,"I’ve been in a very tense mood these last two weeks and yesterday was the first day I felt really good and free of worries but a part of me keeps searching for something to be anxious about. 

It’s like I’m sitting and I’m calm but my mind can’t believe that I’m calm so I start going through a bunch of thoughts in my head looking for something to be anxious about. Then the fact that I may soon become anxious over something puts me on edge

How do I stop this and just enjoy the moment?"
Anxiety,Just diagnosed,"I was just diagnosed with anxiety. It started on my first day at a new school. I had multiple panic attacks throughout the first 3 hours after I woke up. After that day I couldn't get myself to go to school and started making excuses to not go even when I didn't have panic attacks. I ended up not going for two weeks straight. In the third week of school, I finally went but because of this new anxiety, I can't understand my body or mind at all anymore. I've always had anxiety because I've just been a really nervous person since I was a kid, but it was never something that had been diagnosed and it was always normal for me so I got used to it. 

Since I started school it has been good and bad. On the first day, a boy talked to me which got me excited but after a week I realized that I shouldn't be around him. He kept making weird and kind of perverted comments and he always made me feel bad for him and is overall creepy. He has depression and had cuts all over his arms. I had never actually seen someone who cut themselves in real life so this terrified me. Blood, in general, makes me queasy and scared. He also kept trying to get me alone and stares at me and follows me after class. I finally cut him off but things are still crappy. I have a hard time getting to school because of my anxiety, but also because I have been feeling really nauseous in the mornings. This happens a lot before I got diagnosed with anxiety, but especially now it's really bad. I noticed eating in the morning kind of helps but we ran out of the only food I like in the morning. 

I made new friends but I feel like I'm forcing myself on them and they don't want me around. I'm an introvert and making friends is really hard for me especially since this school is ten times bigger than my last school. I haven't even made eye contact with most of the people in my classes. 

My therapist also said that he thinks I don't need him anymore after only two sessions. I got scared because he said if I ever want to meet to just have my parents or myself contact him and make an appointment, but I don't like to talk to my parents about my feelings and I have a hard time with asking for help.

My classes are also a mixed bag of emotions. My math class has the creepy kid in it so that sucks and i have no friends and my group doesn't help me, although I probably help them more than they could help me. My science class is the class I made friends in, but we are doing the worst topics rn. My english class is extremely boring, my teacher has us do writing assignments then has us read for the rest of class (I hate reading). My history class is okay, I like the teacher and I am pretty talkative in the class, but I already learned all the topics we are focusing on just in a different way (and I hate this topic). For electives I take two art classes and one of them sucks because the teacher quit before i even got to enjoy the class, so now its basically a studyhall. My second art class is kinda nice. My teacher is really nice and thinks I should be in a higher level class (which I should but the person helping me with the classes chose this for me). So my teacher put me in honors so we'll see how that goes, but other than that I have to still do the other work from class which is boring because I already learned this in middle and freshman year. Also the topic we are studying is sooooo boring and I hate it.

Anyways the reason why I'm posting this very long rant is to see if I can have some help. I could use some suggesions to help me calm down sometimes for the social anxiety and maybe some good figit toys or something. I just need some way to get back in touch with my body and emotions. Sorry for how long this is."
Anxiety,I dont know whats wrong with me need some help from reddit,"I dont know whats wrong with me and its on my mind every day. Someone help me out a little.  I already have been diagnosed with major depressieve disorder and anxiety.  But I still feel uncertain and confused about what i need to address or how to talk to my therapist about it.  I started having panic attacks at school and at night freshman year and really started feeling heavy anxiety  in my chest every day.  It didnt help that I was in a toxic relationship at the time and it was hard for me to open up and be vulnerable with my partner about mental health.  Im a senior now and have been in and out of depressieve episodes since freshman year.  Been on multiple different medications for bipolar but Im sure im not bipolar because mania doesnt last more than a couple days usually. I got diagnosed with adhd and was prescribed 40 mg of vyvance which helps keeps my head focused during school as well as 100 mg of welbutrin which has been amazing for me.  For the last couple months though i keep having mood swings all week and no day feels the same.  My brother has  autism and its really hard for him to be adept socially, so ive always felt like ive been the i needed to help him and be the “healthy” and “normal one”.  I still get social anxiety all the time especially at school events and school in general.  The mood swings can be exahsting cause i always end up deppressed and angry.  Which leads to me lashing out at people and being kinda hurtful but its hard for me to care.  I have a stable relationship with my girlfriend thank god because she is always very supportive and good at saying the right thing.  Overall im very worried ab everything all the time, ive always been kind of a prefectionist and super hard on myself.  I dont know where i fit in with other people and question who am and and if im even worth anything all the time."
Anxiety,Long boring story I need to share,"Hey, I really didn't know where else to go to share this bad experience. I have no friends, my only human contacts are my S/O and parents, and I don't feel like talking about my mental illness-related issues with them (especially not my parents...)

Today, I had a medical appointment. I have been in pain for over a month and there's only one physiotherapist that I know in my area than can work on my specific issue. For the record: I refrained from booking an appointment with him for months. I was too anxious to do it because I felt like I was bothering him at some point. But I couldn't wait anymore because of the pain.

Backstory: (1) I work from home, and today was an extremely stressful day. We had lots of last-minute emergencies to handle, so I had to wake up early to be able to get work done as much as possible before my appointment. (2) I have hormonal issues and haven't had periods in years. Of course, today was the day I finally got them, and let me tell you my body doesn't handle that very well (migraines, sweat, derealization, and more). (3) Over the past couple of days, I've been receiving phone calls from an unknown number. I never answer phone calls if the person doesn't leave a message (to avoid scams and toxic people from a past life who still sometimes try to join me).

Now the story: I went to my appointment. As usual, I'm on time (5 minutes early even). I wait for a few minutes, then I see someone come out of his office. It's not him. The woman doesn't say hi, she doesn't even look at me. I'm starting to think she's his replacement, and she might have been the person trying to call me to tell me the appointment would be delayed. 

She ends up taking someone else. It was about 15 minutes past the time of my appointment. I'm feeling extremely anxious because of the work I know I have left at home, because it's not my usual practitioner, because of menstrual pain, and because that woman looked cold and mean. So I decided to leave.

A couple of minutes later, I get a phone call from my physiotherapist. He sounds mad and asks me where I am. I was so surprised. I started babbling, trying to explain what happened, but I was so much in distress that I could barely say anything. He ended up saying he didn't have time for me anymore and hanged up.

I feel like shit. I cried for the first time in a year (that's how I know how bad my social anxiety is getting). I barely go out anymore, and every time I do, I'm reminded of why I don't. I just want to stay inside until I find the courage to freaking off myself. And yes, I know it can sound exaggerated like it's just a guy being rude, it happens, get over it.

Yeah no, when your whole life has been dealing with people tearing you down and trying to push you to suicide, when you have no one to talk to, and when you barely see the sunlight because of your mental struggles, a simple mishap like this can cause SO MUCH damage.

I'm so mad at myself for feeling that way. I'm so mad at him like he's probably thinking that I'm the villain of the story. Freaking pisses me off."
Anxiety,Can you please help convince me I don’t have a blood clot,"This obsession is ruining my life the past few months. I can’t get it out of my head even if I have no symptoms of it. 

But for the past couple days I have had this awful pain in my calf right below the knee crease, and I’m convinced I’m going to die. It’s not red or warm or swollen and in my brain I know it’s not a DVT but I can’t help but panic. I feel like crying right now."
Anxiety,Violent content sends me into a spiral. Anything that helps?,"Violent content has always put me in a bad headspace. I tend to avoid tv shows, movies, and games where the violence is very dramatized. I tend to do alright with real world accounts of things which is weird. True crime I can handle unless I'm already in a dark place. But for some reason dramatized, fictional content sets me off. 

For example, today I read some spoilers for Squid Game on Netflix and ever since I've felt this dark cloud over my head and my stomach is in knots. I can't stop obsessing over the details or inserting myself into those situations. I can't tell myself that this stuff isn't real. That doesn't work for me. I've tried breathing exercises and distracting myself. 

I don't necessarily need to consume this content but I can't even read spoiler by accident without this ruining my day. 

Anyone else deal with this?"
Anxiety,Panic Attack Programs,"Has anyone had any success with any programs or reading that helps with panic attacks. I used to get them pretty bad and was on Zoloft for 9 years off and on. I tapered off of the medicine successfully about 4 years ago. It was tough right after I was off but it got better and since about 3 years ago, I would say I haven’t had much issues with anxiety at all. A small panic attack here and there, but nothing like what has happened lately. I feel like I’ve been placed back at square one, only the attacks seem much stronger this time. I used to get the pins and needles in my hands if it was a bad panic attack, but now it seems like the tingling goes all the way up my arm to the elbow. And they are just suddenly happening so frequently. Anytime I’m in the car for more than 15-20 min, and I had my first one at work today. I am trying to get back in with my therapist that helped me when I was coming off the medicine. I admit I failed in that regard and should have been seeing him regularly. I can’t see him until November because I am considered a new patient because of the time that has passed. I’m asking for any advice or any program/information because I really want to be able to make it to November and be with him, as he knows my whole story and I’d like to continue that journey. I feel like I need something in the meantime because I’m very worried that I’m on the edge of this affecting my life and job more than it ever has in the past. Thank you all so much for reading this, and I hope that everyone is well."
Anxiety,I started crying at the doctor’s office and now I feel so ashamed of myself,"I’ve dreaded this doctor’s appointment for the whole last week already, and today, when I arrived at the doctor’s office, the anxiety got even worse. 

The doctor was very nice and considered and I managed to calm myself down enough to sit through the appointment. 

But, in the end, she asked me whether I was feeling alright because I looked a little pale and I don’t know why but I started crying like an idiot. I guess it was the anxiety just boiling over.

I felt so stupid but I couldn’t stop crying. It was probably the worst feeling I’ve had in a while, I felt so helpless against myself.

It was so fucking embarrassing and I’m still crying sitting here writing this because I feel like such an idiot now."
Anxiety,Covid test anxiety,"Hello, I recently have developed some mild cold like symptoms. I am a private tutor so before I see students again, I need to make sure this isn't covid. I am terrified of people putting probes into my body, and I am so scared of someone sticking that probe up my nose. My test is in a couple hours and I am panicked. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you."
Anxiety,Am I asking too much,"Trying to keep the post short and easy, however I’m more than happy to share more details.

I’m a person who feels guilty asking for help.
But I recently had something happen where I’ve had to ask for help, and take time off to deal with it mentally and physically. About 8 days suddenly between the last 2 months. 

And said event caused me to go from a top performer to a middle pack performer.

Ever since I was transparent with my boss on what happened he’s treated me differently.

I’m missing 2 weeks of pay, I keep asking him to approve them and he hasn’t. I also work 50% commission based.
I ask for help and he does nothing until the issue hits critical mass and ends up with a client complaint.
He’d rather take my files and give them to other employees then help me.
In fact he’s never asked me how he can help, when I do he messages back saying it’s my job and I need to figure it out.

Last night he pushed me over the edge, I had another file hit critical mass that I tried so hard to solve. I tried so hard. 
He took the file from me after the client called in, told me he’s tired of dealing with me- tired of me not taking my job seriously, and that I need to change jobs.

I feel like he’s trying to push me out, however I feel guilty due to taking time off to deal with my mental health, getting sober from alcohol, and the issue I got into.

Am I asking for too much, should I go to HR since talking to him isn’t working? I have a offer to go back to my old boss, less pay.
I just don’t want to quit I’ve been doing this for 5 years and love it."
Anxiety,I have a job interview tomorrow,"I've studied all my life, in and out of schools, so I haven't had a proper job ever and I'm already 32.

Once, years ago I dropped out of school due to mental health and burnout... then my neighbour talked me into starting a job as a telemarketer, but that lasted whole 6 days, it was a traumatic experience which made me respect telemarketers a little more.

Went back to school and have been unemployed for years since graduating from the local UAS, in and out of therapy also, depression, anxiety and ADD.

Yesterday I (was semi-pressured into it) sent a job application and today (this soon??) they called me offering an interview. I'm excited but also profoundly terrified, every single time the thought of tomorrow crosses my mind my stomach drops to the floor and I feel so sick, then I force myself to think about something else. I simultaneously hope and dread I get the job, I can't do this. I am bound to screw something up and I feel lost. And beyond embarrassed for feeling this way being this old and terrified."
Anxiety,Crazy question,"Has anyone done, or considered hypnosis therapy for anxiety. I’m very curious about this."
Anxiety,Is this normal?,I have clinical anxiety. Sometimes I feel physical anxiety symptoms without any anxious thoughts. Is this normal?
Anxiety,Going almost numb when thinking about death,"This is kind of confusing for me, because for the longest time i never feared death, at all, but now it's like my mind just went ""you know what? you're gonna fear death, i don't care"", and it's not like i'm old either i'm 18.

So what happens is, i'm going through my day, and suddenly the thought of death crosses my head and goes ""boo"", and then my body goes kind of numb and my vision gets blurry for around 5 seconds, it's the same feeling as you getting up too fast after sitting.

I just wanted to know if someone can help with this, i don't even know if it's serious enough to look for a doctor, but it's not a pleasant feeling when it happens that's for sure"
Anxiety,I'm spiraling hard,Never posted here before. I suffered from anxiety all my life. I  was on an antianxiety for awhile before I felt good enough to quit. I switched over to a stress analysis job. I wasn't really qualified for this job and I let them know but they assured me it was fine. A year later and some issues were found in something I analyzed when I first started here. I was nervous but everything worked out it got fixed but the guy who found the first issue has maybe found another issue. I am freaking out and feel like I don't belong here at my job. Like I will be fired any minute. I couldn't stop thinking about it last night to the point I was almost in tears and I'm paralyzed with it today. It's been so long since I've experienced anything like this. I don't even know what to say or to expect from posting this.
Anxiety,Life feels like a never ending battle.,[removed]
Anxiety,Helping a partner with sudden anxiety attacks?,"Hi all,

I’m (29F) hoping for some help for my partner (28M) who has, within the last year, suddenly developed really bad anxiety. The stress of the pandemic, working freelance, and moving to a smaller house have all been really hard on him, but his anxiety is starting to become really hard for me to help him with. I have tried so hard to listen and assuage his concerns, but I know anxiety can be an awful beast, with a new concern cropping up and feeding it next, but it’s really becoming detrimental to our relationship.

About a year ago my partner started to get occasional moments of anxiety about our relationship. We’ve been together for nearly 9 years, and we broke up for a brief period 4 years ago, as I felt he wasn’t listening to some of my concerns about how fast the relationship moved sometimes, emotionally and physically. 

Up until a year ago, we had managed to put all these concerns behind us and he was really putting in the work of listening to these prior concerns, although I do feel a bit like this effort was sometimes inconsistent. His panic is based in him not feeling like a good enough boyfriend, or that he’s not doing enough.

I try and reassure him as much as I can, but it becomes hard when he says “I love you” a hundred times a day and is concerned if there is any change in my cheer levels. He now spirals to the point of hour-long anxiety attacks incredibly quickly, and I have tried to reassure him as best as I can, and research as much as possible about anxiety attacks. 

As an example- The other day he had a really bad anxiety attack because he opened a drawer above where I was kneeling down, so when I stood up I accidentally knocked into it with my shoulder. I had seen him open the drawer and knew to move around it, I just misjudged the space and knocked myself, but he was convinced this was proof that he was a bad boyfriend and could not breathe until I reassured him 20 or 30 times and then had to step in with grounding exercises. It’s hard because I know that it is detrimental to his self esteem to have someone else step in and help him through it but he won’t research his own grounding exercises and views anxiety itself with such an embarrassed lens.

The trouble is that sometimes I really need to tell him that something he said or did upset me a bit, or to talk about a relationship issue, but it’s invariably met with an anxiety attack that he needs me to help him through, meaning my concerns are put on the back burner. He is acutely aware of this also, which I think only makes his spiralling moments worse. 

I’ve tried to talk to him when he has calmed down, usually the next day, about getting help or finding some anxiety resources but it usually just starts the spiral back up anew as he feels he isn’t doing enough, or doesn’t want to talk about it because he’s in a good place now and he feels so embarrassed about having the anxiety attack in the first place. I try and tell him that it’s nothing to be embarrassed about, anxiety is an awful experience but not his fault, and we just need to work towards conquering it. He needs to work on finding his own coping mechanisms that work for him, but I can’t seem to convince him of this and I’m becoming really burnt out from being put in the position of talking him through grounding exercises when he’s panicking so hard he can’t breathe well. I’ve tried to ask him to do his own research, but it’s like when he is out of the anxious moment he forgets there is work to be done to help himself through the next one, or doesn’t want to because he feels so embarrassed about it.

We aren’t at a place, monetarily, that major therapy is an option, so I’ve tried to get some books for CBT, anxiety and couples therapy for us to work through together. He reads a couple pages maybe for ten minutes the next day after he has an anxiety attack, then feels he’s good and doesn’t maintain it, resulting in another attack very quickly, sometimes 5 in a day. 

He has never had any mental health issues up until this point, to the point that his whole friend group knew him as the most stable, unshakeable one. Whenever he isn’t having active anxiety he is so cheery, pleasant, interested and kind- I really worry for him when it takes over though, and want to help him, but it’s getting to the point that not only can I not talk to him about any of our relationship concerns, I have to maintain a heightened level of happiness in myself because any change in my own mood means an anxiety attack for him because he feels he couldn’t help me fix it or the vibes set off his own concerns.

I hope my concerns don’t come off too harshly, I genuinely love him and try and be as supportive as possible, but I can’t help but feel that I’m feeding an unhealthy coping mechanism.

Any help with this would be wonderful, or even just any similar experiences shared would be so helpful too.
Thank you in advance!"
Anxiety,"Fear of driving, insecurity and financial stress","So I have seen some posts in this reddit about the fear of driving. My situation is a bit different though, so that’s why I’m posting this. I’m a 21 year old university student in The Netherlands and I love sportcars! My dream is to own a Ferrari in my life and I think it’s possible. The strange thing is, that I’m scared to drive. I know I can solve this fear by driving a lot, but the problem is I don’t own a car and I can’t afford one. I could use my parent’s car occasionally but since I crashed it, they won’t let me drive it by myself. The last years I have worked my ass off to get in a better situation financially but I’m young so I didn’t make much money. I left one job and at my other job there are not many working hours going towards me anymore. I’m tired all the time and still want to finish my bachelor this year, so getting another job again is no fun at all. The fear of driving makes me insecure so I don’t show up at meetings far away and I’m scared to date girls, because I can’t drive while they probably can. I feel like I’m stuck in live and it makes me feel terrible. Please help!"
Anxiety,Anxiety of being murdered because of the job I want to pursue.,"I want to be a geneticist. But a lot of people seem to hate that scientific field and if there are a lot of people who hate something that bad that some on is going to go to the extreme. There hasn't been a single murder/attack on a geneticist because he/she was a geneticist but I dont want to be the first and since there is still a lot of time until I pursue that carrier a lot could change. There all ready have been sabotages of studies about genetically engineered plants which are better or regions were planting space is small since these plants have more nutrition then there normal variant so these people dont care what the purpose of the experiment is. The likelihood of something similar or worse happening to me depends on: what I am doing  research of genes or development of genetically modified organisms (and which organisms), how ""famous"" I am, where I live at that time (probably Germany), how the general opinion on the topic is (in the moment it is rather negative to neutral), etc. . The problem is that I cant control these possible causes or I dont exactly know what I am going to do in the genetic field. In the moment I would prefer to work for a company and just do research which doesn't involve topics like modifying mosquitoes to not be deadly or humans to make them ""better"". Which results in me probably researching genetic disorders and trying to find a cure. But I dont know if I want do that since I dont have any experience which I cant get because I am to young. And I cant see my self working as something else then a geneticist or a biochemist so its a relevant problem I have been trying to solve for a relatively long time."
Anxiety,Anyone else feel really odd when it anxious?,"I haven’t been feeling the slightest bit anxious the past 3 days and it’s been amazing but also I have this weird feeling from not being anxious. I’ve been anxious for a couple months now and now that I’m like completely calm and haven’t been anxious for a bit my body just feels off, like not completely normal? Has anyone else felt this way?"
Anxiety,Starting new job tomorrow,"Hey everyone,

I have quit my last job (which was super stressful and my panic attacks were just really bad), and then I had a month off and I've travelled solo through Europe, came back on Saturday evening and tomorrow (Friday 1st of October) is my first working day. I don't really know why, but I'm just been feeling really anxious, and I'm scared Iwill not be able to sleep tonight (anxiety = bad sleep for me). It's a whole new job with less responsibilities and more of a routine, so not sure why I feel this way. It's nothing like my old job and much more laid back. Any tips to decrease my anxiety a bit?

Thanks!"
Anxiety,Am i the only one,Whenever i feel anxious my body temperature either gets  too cold or too hot.I have social anxiety and had to text someone idk and now i feel like i have a fever.Once i was drinking iced coffee alone  in starbucks and idk if it’s the caffeine or the ice but i started to shake uncontrollably and when i thought about people noticing that i’m shaking i started to shake even more and had to leave.Is there a way to control this?🤦🏼‍♀️
Anxiety,I just have to tell some about my anxiety,"Honestly your  not going to want to read because it’s probably going to be all over the pace and not make since idk. Not to mention it’s pretty long.

My anxiety started has social anxiety when I was around 12 or 13. At this time I had just entered 6th grade. I had always been shy and never really had any actual friends. However that changed that year because me and 3 other people befriended each other because of our common interest in Xbox. We would hang out all day at school and play Xbox with each other until our bedtime. Out side of these 3 friends I would literally not talk to anyone. If I tried it would always just feel so awkward. And I would get this feeling in my head that at the time I couldnt really explain other than my mind feeling”fuzzy” I never really put much thought into tho and still just thought it was me being shy. I didn’t even know what the word anxiety was. It was like this for the next two years. Just a slight uncomfortableness when talking to anyone I didn’t know. Then came along 9th grade. I don’t know what change but this is when things started getting bad. 

In my first period on my first day of school the teacher had us do an activity to learn each others names. It was like a game where the first person would state their name. Then the second person had to remember persons 1 name, then state there own name. And this continued down the line. I remember having so much anxiety because I was near the back of the class and was going to have to call out like 20 peoples name in front of the class. My mind was racing, my heart was pounding, my palms were sweaty, and my hands were shaking. It finally got to be my turn and I stood up I front of the class. I could just tell my face was red From the burning heat I could feel coming from my cheeks. I started listing the names and it felt like I had just went in to a third person point of view watching myself. And as I’m listing names I started to get more anxiety that people would notice how red my face was, how shaky my voice was, and how I was basically just staring into the ceiling. I ended up getting through the names and it was the next persons turn but I still just wanted to vomit. It occurred to me that something similar to this would probably happen in the rest of my 6 periods.  I started dwelling on this thought and it was the only thing I could think about. And sure enough basically every period we did some sort of name learning activity. And every time the attention was on me I had the same reaction as the first. I made it through the day though and it was i huge relief when I got home that I wasn’t going to have to go through that again. I was wrong. From this point forward any interaction I had with people  (other than my original 3 person friend group) gave me bad anxiety. A 1on one conversions made go into “third person mode” where it feels like your of two different minds. One is controlling your body and the things you say. The other is like your consciousness where your observing every move movement you make to make sure it’s normal and to process what you say, only after you say it, to make sure it made since. I would dred going to school everyday. Then In the second semester of 9th grade we were forced to take a class called oral communication. It’s a class in which you would spend a week or two working on most often a solo project, then you would have to present it to the class. This became my worst fuc*ing night mare. All I could think about in school and out of school was the next time I would have to present. Like every 30 minutes for the 18weeks  the thought would cross my mind and give me anxiety. It was hell. 
 
Anyways I felt like I needed to share the beginnings of my anxiety for you to understand where I’m at now. Through out that entire time I never told any one about what I was going through. I kept it from my friends and I kept it from my parents. This kind of anxiety stayed with me through out of all of high school. When it came to anything i did that required being outside of my house made me anxious.  Specific things like doctors, dentists, and eye doctor appointments I would dwell on for weeks in advance. It took me a month after turning 16 to finally get my license. I was shaking the entire test. I didn’t attend my own graduation because the thought of being on stage in front of thousands even for like 5 seconds gave me panic attacks. My mom was so upset that I didn’t walk. I had to play it off like I just didn’t really care about school and graduation. Like it wasn’t any sort of accomplishment. Because one of my biggest anxiety’s was telling anyone about what I was going through. It’s hard to explain. I wanted to tell my parents so I could get proper help and medication but I couldn’t because my anxiety just won’t let me. 
Now I’ve been graduated for two years. I still live at home with my parents and I still haven’t told anyone about what I’m going through. My parents have been pushing me to get a job and start living my life for over a year now. But now they are getting serious about it. No more living rent free with no job. But the amount of anxiety I have I can’t even fathom the idea of me going through the interview process then having to work a job in which I’m pretty much guaranteed To have social interactions daily. I also can’t fathom the thought of sitting down with my parents and tell them what I’ve been going through for years and years. Not out of fear of them not being understanding it’s just... idk I just can’t because... anxiety. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve started contemplating suicide because I really don’t think I can live like this any longer. But for obvious reasons(anxiety) I don’t think I could actually do that to myself. 

I just don’t know what the fuc* to do I feel like I’m going insane.  

Like I said there was know real point to this post. I just needed some one to know what I was going through."
Anxiety,Can i have two therapists ?,"
Long story short im 21F always had anxiety/ocd but going through a big flare up since may. Already experienced something like this and went through it on my own but now i want to do therapy and solve my problems before my adult life if that makes sense.
I started seeing this therapist (we will call her N) right before my flare up which i think happened a little bit because of therapy and talking about trauma but i dont feel like shes getting that i have a panic disorder since may and that i have irrational phobias. I get along with her and everything is perfect and were working to see the root of the problem but i could use some help with my panic and my life right now. I learned about CBT and how it would be perfect for me so i talked with a Cbt therapist today and she told me with the time and the money i could totally do both therapies at the same time or pause my therapy with N, get a CBT therapy and then go back to N which i think is a great « everyday therapist » if u get me. Sorry if this is long and sorry for my english since im not a native speaker but is this really a possibility and is this helpful?"
Anxiety,Getting anxiety afterwards,"I’d say the bulk of my anxiety happens before and during doing something, which is obviously difficult.

But one thing I’ve noticed recently is getting anxiety afterwards. I did something big today, I went to a freshers event at uni and it went so well. I was a bit anxious before but whilst it was happening I was really absorbed in conversation and barely thought about my anxiety. 

But now I’m feeling a bit drained and on edge, slightly nauseous. Does anyone else get this after social events?"

Anxiety,"Today, Everyday.","Today is a hard day. I’m stuck in my head and can’t keep myself from looking back at every mistake I’ve made in my life, every piece of me that I threw away for things that never lasted. The pain, anger, frustration all of the emotions and memories attached to the past still hurt everyday. 

I know I am strong and willing, and I am trying my hardest to pull myself back up and find who I am, but I am so lost. I don’t know how to love myself if I feel I don’t even know who I am. From every angle I have someone smiling telling me it’s all going to be okay, or giving me advice of what they would do if they were me. I am not me and I am certainly not okay. How do I take a step forward at the lowest point in my life without answering the question of why I am here?

Why am I here? Who am I? What is my goal? My purpose? These thoughts and more flying through my head a mile a minute. How can I let others love and support me when I don’t know who I am? I certainly don’t have the answers and the harder I look the more confused I am.

I feel so conflicted and confused about every little decision. Who do you listen to when you can’t trust yourself? I guess no one. Life is an uphill battle right now, and I’m out of energy, stuck at the bottom of the hill."

Anxiety,My mind doesn't stop (I know im not alone in these feelings),"I don't know how to not be afraid about contracting covid and passing it on to other people. Even if folks are fully vaxxed, it isn't 100%, no vaccine is 100% effective. Maybe ill forever be terrified, and never hang out with anyone. Ugh. I'm feeling disheartened. And sad. I've been fully vaccinated since June. I'm a PSW and I'm just constantly afraid that im going to contract it from someone, and be asymptomatic and pass it on to someone (the people I work for with disabilities) and they die. I am grateful, however, that I live with my loving partner. (Please don't come at me with anti-vax nonsense. &lt;3)"

Anxiety,Fear of Rabies,"3 weeks ago when I was on vacation in Palm Springs with friends, I woke up with a bite on my foot. 

I assumed it was a bug bite from a spider or something, but my irrational/anxiety side of my brain of course made me start wondering if a bat bit me during my sleep or when I was outside with my friends the night before. Here’s the picture of the bite: it’s a spider bite I’m pretty sure: https://imgur.com/gallery/Kcm3xp4 

I’ve had heachaches and tingling on different parts of my body ever since but I know these are just symptoms of my anxiety. 

I restarted my lexapro prescription I stopped in June as I thought I had adjusted well, but this has just restarted all my fears and anxious tendencies. 

Overall: I need some comfort and ways I can calm down to get over this fear/anxious moment."
Anxiety,Does anxiety cause dry sticky lips?,"I know dry mouth is a common symptom of anxiety. Lately, I've noticed that when I'm anxious, my lips in particular get very dry and sticky. Is there any relationship? How does lower production of saliva affect the lips?"
Anxiety,My efforts to be there for someone were rejected and made me super anxious,"My partner and I both have depression and anxiety and we are struggling to manage it.  We keep triggering each other and find it really difficult to pull it back when that happens.  Both person believes their own story and is hurt the other person doesn't see their perspective. The back and forth effort to communicate and the hurt it causes the other can mean we get stuck in a funk an all day.

So this morning my partner was very down and depressed.  Covid restrictions and being unable to do life as planned has been getting to him A LOT.  I was trying to cheer him up or help him or just be there for him, I was asking him what he needed and what I could do for him - could I make him something to eat? could we talk about some positives in life? or perhaps he just needed some space?  He just kept shrugging me off, telling me he wasn't hungry, snapping at me - nothing I was doing was working.

This made me anxious.  I could feel it coming on. I feel helpless and like all my efforts are worth nothing - there's nothing I can do can help him.  I was trying to be positive and upbeat and he wasn't taking it well. I have been trying to be mindful of my anxiety and I kept telling myself I was doing all the right things, he just wasn't responding favourably.   I felt tight in the chest and unable to move on, I decided to talk to him about my anxious feelings, I said ""You are just moping around all day with your shoulders slumped and sighing loudly, it's giving me anxiety as despite my best efforts, I just can't cheer you up.""  

Well, that caused him to blow up, I tried to reassure him that my intentions are good and I just want to be there for him, there's no need for this drama, I love him etc etc etc, just grasping for something but we was so worked up I had to leave the house. 

He then messaged me accusing me of mocking him, attacking him for being mentally ill, that as a person that is meant to be supporting him I was torching him.  He told me that I was being manic and crazy and lying to myself about helping him.  No no no, I'm just trying to help I say.  He tells me I'm bulldozing him, that I think I'm being calm and loving but I'm actually being defensive and aggressive.  WTF this kind of talk makes my anxiety even worse!

I came home and he's in bed keeping away from me.  It's now the evening and this has gone on all  day.  I'm so tired of this and I just don't know what to do :("
Anxiety,Anxiety or Covid?,"So I just had the weirdest experience. For starters, I felt kind of shitty earlier tonight (stuffy nose like allergies, increased heart rate, stomach pain) so I took 1000 mg of vitamin c thinking I might be coming down with something… potentially covid. As I was getting ready for bed, I started to feel my heart rate increase even more and my feet were clammy. Suddenly, as I’m laying in bed, my body starts to shake. I wasn’t sure whether I definitely had covid or having an anxiety attack because when I got vaccinated the only symptom I had after was body shakes/chills. I put in a hoodie &amp; some socks, took half a Xanax, and after roughly 15 minutes I felt better.

So, I guess my question is, has anyone here who has had covid felt similar symptoms? I hate that the symptoms for covid and anxiety are so similar!"
Anxiety,Can BFS symptoms be “triggered? through anxiety?,"Like something brings back bad memories, or of a major fear of yours that you never reconciled with. Or if you see something that triggers you. I only get BFS when I think of such things. But I also have anxiety. So everyone keeps telling me it’s my anxiety. But here’s what I keep trying to tell everybody but nobody understands or just doesn’t listen. 

I know I’ve always had anxiety. I’ve had it since I was little. But whenever I was scared of stuff like Spiderman, I got usual panic attacks. No BFS symptoms. Only now, when I think of things that fear me like a specific phobia, do I get there BFS symptoms. However I don’t even realize that I’m scared of them. If I was never scared of them I would never come to the conclusion that this is anxiety related. It’s always when this stuff gets mentioned that I have BFS symptoms. And I don’t get any sinking feeling in my stomach all my heart beating. It’s like someone mentions it and I instantly feel pins, major itches, spasms, numbness and all the rest. How does this work? I’ve been trying to find an answer for so long and this keeps me up at night"

Anxiety,Looking for some advice how to handle this college dorm situation🥲,"I’m fr the most anxious person in the entire world. I moved into my college dorm yesterday afternoon. And so far it has been both the worst and best thing that’s ever happened to me. I met so many great people and have been really blessed with a good roommate. However, my current dorm situation is freaking me out. This is the second night in a row that I can’t sleep. First of all my dorm has 28 floors. 28 FLOORS. I’m on the 12th floor. I have a fear of heights and claustrophobia. Am I literally the dumbest person in the whole world? Second night that I’m currently shaking in bed crying silently having panic attack after panic attack. I can’t look out the window because it makes me physically sick. Every time I go into the elevator I start to have a panic attack. I actually hate my dorm so much. Also being in a dorm is LOUD. And obnoxious. I’m trying not to be a big baby because it’s only been two days but for how much I pay to live in these dorms and feel unhappy is absolutely ridiculous. All the dorm buildings on campus have 20+ floors. So my only option is to email my RA and see if I can get moved to a lower floor (will I even feel better?) or I literally have to drop out. What do I do! Currently second night in a row that I’m wide awake at 3:43 am."
Anxiety,Starting school again,"Heya- I'm Alex and I'm starting school again after getting so panicked about eighth grade that I technically quit. I ended up passing (out of pity I think) and I'm in a much more smaller school so it doesn't look too overwhelming. My problem is that I just heard about this school and I'm already going to go tomorrow! I prefer some time to think and plan but it doesn't seem I have that. I've been in the school to look around and despite it being just one hall I am still nervous about even walking out of a class by myself. The thing I am most afraid of is messing up or someone talking to me and I come off as mean in some way! I tend to get a bit snappy or glare when someone talks to me cause the first thing I think is that they are being forced to talk to me or it's a joke! I don't want to glare at someone by a accident and make everyone in my new school hate me. I'm also afraid I might accidently break a rule.. I usually avoid everything possible so that doesn't happen..but I'm still worried. My dad tells me to just push through the anxiety but I feel like I'm gonna die.. we already planned on writing on sticky notes when I want to speak to the teachers but still everything else involving my existence in this place sounds terrifying to me.

Support and suggestions on how to calm down would be good- I might end up staying up all night because of all of this.."
Anxiety,I can't work here anymore,"Hello, r/Anxiety,

Without diving too deep into my struggle with anxiety, I'll provide a bit of relevant information to explain my situation.

I work in healthcare, in a job with massive responsibility and massive related stress. To keep it short, I'm responsible for conducting tests that ultimately determine the wellbeing of the patients in our community hospital. I'm good at my job and cautious to boot, but the weight of the role has been detrimental enough to my mental wellbeing that over that last five years I've been to multiple therapists, called out at an increasingly regular rate due to anxiety induced insomnia, have had to take a month off on short term disability to recover from an especially difficult bout of depression and anxiety and truly believe that if I stay in this role I am going continue to suffer even further. I can't live with it anymore. To be blunt, the role has taken a toll on my mental health in a really awful way. I have not been able to relax my mind and live presently and calmly in half a decade. I am genuinely suffering everyday.

 The stress if the work itself is only compounded by a chaotic schedule - after my medical leave I requested, on the advice of my practioner, for reduced hours. Not only was I denied reduced hours but my schedule was made nonsensical and unpredictable- my set schedule has become a salad of different shifts. This week alone I work 11a-7p one day, 6a-3p the next, followed by 3p-11p and then circling back to 11-7. I don't even have time to prepare myself for these hours - the schedules are frequently posted only 2-3 days in advance.

I am wrapping up my final courses for a new degree that will allow me to start a new career in something less intense, which should be complete by February of 2022. While I realize that light at the end of the tunnel is so close, it seems so far away and I don't think I can or should stick it out for even that much longer. The issue tying me to my present position is unfortunately health insurance. My husband relies on the insurance from my employer to see the multiple doctors he needs to keep his blood pressure, cholesterol and mental health in check. If I leave my employer, that insurance is gone. So you can see, it is difficult to just put in my two weeks and hope something comes along. 

With all that said, my question is this; are there any options for actually affordable healthcare if I leave my employment? The doctor who took me out of work last year for mental health reasons is no longer at her practice, so I'm not sure a new doctor that I have no history with would be so willing to do that again while I look for something new. Looking at the marketplace, my options appear to begin at about 500 dollars each, monthly, which is 1000 dollars I won't have if I am not working. 

I just feel stuck and I need help or guidance making a really important move away from where I am now. I feel hopeless and kind of terrified. Is there any viable way anyone knows of that can make this work? I've looked into retail employers which would cut my salary in half but would be worth it to save my aching brain, but even that is anxiety inducing because I don't even know if any of these employers would hire me. I feel like I could make money for private insurance on my own if only it were about half the estimated price that I'm finding it to actually be. 

Thanks. 

Also, the fact that we (Americans) are forced into unhealthy labor situations by employers dangling healthcare like a carrot from a stick makes me fucking nauseous."

Anxiety,Can panic attack last only a few seconds?,"Ive had two panic attacks before but they lasted thirty minutes each.

Anxiety,Does anyone get ocular migraines?,"I get them once in awhile. I haven’t had one in like several months and got one just a bit ago. I woke up twice tonight and felt a frontal/forehead on/off slight headache and didn’t think much of it, fell asleep and woke up a bit ago to my vision looking weird like I was freaking out cause I didn’t know what was happening yet and then I started seeing the ocular migraine start and it wasn’t much this time but for like 5 minutes the visual part, I took Tylenol just now. 

Everytime I get these I get extremely anxious, I had a mri in November 2018 &amp; a ct scan in October 2020 and all normal but I still get so anxious cause these migraines mess with your vision ugh.

Anxiety,Intense fear of video calls,"Over the entire pandemic I’ve managed to avoid making video calls entirely as I already worked from home, communicating with people via email. I’ve recently sought help for some medical issues and because of the pandemic lots of services are still using video calls for appointments. I have an intense fear of phone calls and video calls and because of this I’ve cancelled numerous appointments at the last minute or simply just turned my devices off to pretend nothing is happening. I don’t know why I’m like this but when I’m sat waiting for a call I just get overwhelmingly anxious and convince myself that I don’t need whatever appointment I’m supposed to have. 

I know long term this is an issue I need to get over (probably with the help of mental health professionals) but does anyone have any tricks to get over this in the short term?"
Anxiety,Can you hyperventilate without even realising it?,My right leg keeps getting this prickly feeling every so often around my calf and leg in general. Only mild and not painful but it’s a weird sensation. It’s like someone is lightly stabbing me with a needle then it goes. I have been told i could not be breathing properly but I can’t tell if i am or not.
Anxiety,2 hours fretting for a 2 minute phone call.,"Today, i called the psychology team who see me for my anxiety. It was a necessary call as I need to cancel my appointment for reasons I cannot disclose. But, understandably I was very scared to do so. 

I hate phone calls, because I cannot see what the other person is doing on the other end. I know they can potentially see unpleasant things about me - my search history, my address, my thoughts, my dreams. 

Anyway, after two hours of pacing and wondering how they were going to get to me, I bit the bullet and phoned up. 

the lady who answered wanted my name, my date of birth, and my address, all of which I was very reluctant to give over. She was firm but patient, I gave her my old address, rather than my current, which thankfully she accepted from me - another reason I’m grateful to have not updated my medical records.. 

I can’t let these people know who or what I am. I’m still waiting for the day the health services all find out about the monstrosities and knock down my door in the new town I live in. 

the worst part of the phone call was when she asked “WHY” I am cancelling the appointment. I told her I cannot disclose, but that it was personal, and I just can’t attend. She seemed suspicious, which threw me into a cycle of doubt and fear and anxiety. 

Will she know I’m lying? I don’t know if I can ever show my face to my doctors again. But they know me and how to contact me which is terrifying.

Does anyone else get anxiety like this? or feel like they need to go on the run and start a new life to hide from the evil thoughts? The past? The stress of holding someone else’s life together?"
Anxiety,Please help me,"So I get stomach pain with stress, and it's getting worse and worse. A few years ago, I got it badly enough and often enough that I couldn't do classes, couldn't do anything.

Anxiety,Existential crisis about being Florida trash,"This is more of a vent so sorry if this is long 

When I woke up this morning I had a full blown anxiety attack. I’ve been having some major self esteem issues since 2020, about my class and my status in society. 

It’s been eating away at me for a while, and I’m becoming incredibly self conscious. About my looks, my mannerisms. I suffer from social anxiety and depression, and I’m pretty sure it shows in public. 

I’m terrified at the prospect of aging badly and becoming a stereotypical “Florida woman”, and feel like there’s no escaping it. I was raised in an abusive lower-middle class family and have been trying to “move up” in the world. 

What triggered this is getting a new job, my first real job. 

I’m interacting with people who are on a corporate level, who come from better environments. It’s all very overwhelming and I’m becoming increasingly self critical and scared. This fear has made me leave jobs, because I just want to hide away from the world. 

My anxiety has been so bad for the last few weeks that my hair has been falling out. I’m very unhappy in general. 

But, I have to wait for my insurance to kick in to see a therapist or a doctor. I desperately want to take a few days off, but can’t because I’m new. I don’t want to reinforce the suspicions that there’s something wrong with me I suppose."
Anxiety,Trying to get the courage to talk to my doctor,"Hi all :)

I had my first panic attack at the age of 14, and at the age of 26 I still struggle with anxiety, although thankfully I have managed to improve a lot due to a lot of hard work. 

I was brushed off when I thought I needed help at 14, with people around me saying its probably just hormonal and I'll grow out of it etc. That completely put me off getting help because whenever I consider it I feel like an intruder.

Will a doctor think I don't need help if I've ""managed"" for this long without it? I'm terrified to take the step but for the first time in my life almost feel strong enough to do so."
Anxiety,"Overanalyse every social situation, feel incapable of making friends","I have really struggled with anxiety; even from childhood, I was over apologetic over everything, which only got progressively worse as I go to secondary school, to the point I basically didn't attend school. Eventually, once I left school, it got a bit better. But because of it, I've never really had a social group and always felt like I was missing out. 

Eventually, I went to University, and for the first time in my life, I was confident and had friends. But being in a social group still gave me anxiety- especially the politics of it all. The friends I made could be lovely, but they also had a lot to say about everyone behind their backs. And I found myself joining in with them, desperate to be a part of a group. I met my current partner, and I found myself being embarrassed about what we would say about people, especially in front of him. It wasn't nice. 

And basically, from there, it all blew up. I was living with the group of girls, and I was making a cup of tea and saw my name flash up on my housemate's phone. It was a bitchy text about me; they were saying nasty things behind my back. This was it for me, and I basically said I want no part of the bitching. Which offended my friend, and to cut a long story short, they excluded me from the group. All my ex-friends would come over to our house for drinks nights, takeaways, parties, and I was never invited. I would say hello to my ex-friend, and she would ignore me, and the rest would follow suit. To put it in context, we were all studying fashion together at uni- so a lot of big egos. 

Since then, my anxiety has gotten progressively worse; I'm full of so much self-hatred and feel like I am incapable of having friendships. I have finished Uni and have move cities with my partner, we love living in the city- but we have no friends. We moved in lockdown, which doesn't help. 

We went to a gig on Sunday and bumped into my partner's old friend from his city. He was really nice, and so were his friends. But I found myself feeling really crappy afterwards, like over analysing every little thing I did in case I was weird or unfriendly. Feel totally socially incapable now. Felt like we came across as desperate."
Anxiety,Physical symptoms of anxiety + medication,"I've had anxiety for the best part of 10 years now, but only in the past year or so it's got extremely bad and is having a serious affect on every aspect of my life. When I get anxious my throat tightens up causing me to gag and struggle for air, also my stomach starts churning which just makes the experience a lot worse. 

My anxiety is triggered by situations that I can't just easily walk away from. So I'm usually fine if I just walk into a shop on my own and pick up a couple of things, but once I get in the queue for checkout and there's people around me, I get these violent symptoms and I just want to drop everything and run, usually when my anxiety gets triggered in these situations I am too afraid to go back and put myself in those situations again which has also had a huge negative affect on my mental health simply because I haven't been leaving my house much

Would medication be my best option to help me manage this anxiety? I've tried CBT in the past but didn't find it very effective at all unfortunately. I just want to start living my life again, I'm 20 years old and I feel like the most valuable years of my life are being wasted because of this, any input is greatly appreciated!"
Anxiety,"I've recently invested my whole money in under construction apartment, and ever since that day my life has become hell.","Hello, I've been having panick attacks in random moments ever since I HAPPILY invested every penny I'd gotten in my apartment. They come from random thoughts that suddenly pop up in my head: earthquake gonna destroy it and I'M GONNA BECOME HOMELESS; the elevator's gonna become faulty and I WON'T BE ABLE TO SELL IT AND I WILL HAVE TO WALK UP 11 STAIRS EVERY DAY WHEN I'M OLD; My neighbors' gonna cause fire and I WILL BECOME HOMELESS; the deal wasn't that good, I got  scammed and EVERYONE'S GONNA LAUGH AT MY FAILURES; etc..

This is the only time I've ever done something this major, I don't even take manor risks, EVER. This is the first time in how many years that I've to trust ""fate"".  I've made a big mistake. A person like me shouldn't have taken on a challenge this big.


How do I let go of my worries? I don't currently take any medications, but no panick attack has ever been this big - until now I've never experienced a meltdown, that I remember for sure. The isurance situation is pretty taught, is visiting a doctor for medications the only good option?"
Anxiety,Butterflies in stomach...,"I think I have a crush on a girl, and since she is in my friend group we see each other from time to time. When I'm around her or just thinking about her I get this really really strong butterfly in the stomach type of effect, It kills my appetite, it messes up my stomach and it brings nausea. I think this may have something to do with anxiety? I don't get this strong of a reaction when I'm about to do important stuff, like taking an exam. I hate this feeling because it makes me physically ill. Can someone relate? By the way, I don't know if it's a wise idea to man up and just tell her, because I have no clue if she even knows I exist. 

Don't even know if it's the right sub to post in, but I'll give it a shot"
Anxiety,Anyone here who had globus sensation for a long time now?,How did you guys cope with daily feeling of something stuck on your throat? I have globus sensation due to anxiety and Gerd for almost a week now and I'm starting to go hopeless almost everyday thinking my this feeling will turn into worst.
Anxiety,Anxiety of measuring blood pressure,"Hi all! I have had a lot of anxiety about my blood pressure reading, and I thought there would be other people with same situation. 

I stress a lot about my blood pressure and I measure it many times per day (""best"" days probably 20-40 Times). Sometimes, readings are 120/80 which is normal in my opinion. But sometimes I feel very stressed when taking blood pressure it might be 130-140/90-95. 

Anyone in same situation? This stress me a lot, even though I know (in some level) that this high blood pressure is because of anxiety."
Anxiety,Would it be in my best interest to talk to a doctor?,"So I get anxious, I can't remember not being an anxious person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD but that's neither here nor there. 

For the past couple years I've been struggling with feeling like I might die soon, I also stress pointlessly about finances, my future, the fact I never know what I'm doing or how to do anything. I analyse every little thing going on in my body and out and tend to blow it out of proportion in my head. I've tried a selection of SSRIs but I just can't stand them. I've done over a years therapy and got nothing out of it. Is it worth having a conversation with a doctor again or is this just something I kinda have to deal with my whole life?

I'm only asking cause I'm getting so damn tired of having it sap the joy out of even my favourite things like my workouts or video games and it's really, really wearing me out. I still do them as much as possible, it's just hard when you're trying to squat or go for a run and you can't shake the thought that I could have a heart attack and die at any minute. Especially now I've had the Pfizer vaccine I'm terrified it's gonna kill me."
Anxiety,I WILL RECOVER,"Hi guys how are you!
These days have been very bad tbh, I thought this summer would be my summer, but no, nothing good happened. I have been so anxious, and after thinking and thinking, I got a conclusion. Guys in tired, I'm tired of beeing anxious, I want to be happy, I want that my only worry during the day is what I'm going to have for dinner, I want to be FREE.
The conclusion I got is that I have been Complaining and Victimizing myself every time I have to deal with this shit, and nothing happened. No matter how many times I cried, how many times I shout cause the rage of having this, nothing happened. And it will never happen, CAUSE I M NOT WORKING. That's the conclusion, TO BE FREE we have to be better than the guy who entered in this anxiety world, we have to be better than Our past self, and to do that we have to work. I'm not talking about doing meditation one day, and the rest of the week not doing nothing, I'm talking about really beeing constant. How many time do we thought "" if I would have started working 4 months ago, now I would be free"", then why don't we start now?
I'm not gonna lie, I do not feel good now, I'm feeling numb, like with no emotions, I'm feeling disconnected from the world (dpdr) I'm feeling so weird and I'm having a fear of going crazy constantly. I'm literally analyzing everything that happens to me and my anxious brain automatically tries to just relate it with a mental illnes. That means I'm so anxious, and I'm not doing the right steps.
Guys I swear to God, and I swear to all of you if you read this, that I'm going to work, I will start my day at 7am by beeing thankfull and meditate, every day, 2 times per day 15 minutes, I will do yoga 4 times a week once a day, I will eat healthy, no sugar, no salt, no caffeine, only healthy food and many fruits and vegetables. I will try to cry once a week, ( it helps with numbness feelings) I will start no fap (it may help with social anxiety, I know many ppl don't think it helps, but I will try it by myself) and I will keep going to the gym as I do now.
Guys Im sure this is just anxiety, even if my brain is constantly trying to tell me is something more serious. I won't give up. I can.
I will keep you updated in 10 days."
Anxiety,Alot of dental issues,"So just as the title says I went to the dentist yesterday and was told I have alot of cavities and need 2 root canals. This terrified me, so much so I panicked and couldn't stay in the office and left shortly after. I guess my fear really just comes from the lack of control and possibility of pain during the procedure. When the dentist was annoyed that I wouldn't stay she wrote a referral for me to go to a specialist with a note saying due to my nervousness I probably need sedation. The problem is, THIS also scares me due to me hearing about things going wrong with it. It's going to be hard to get myself to go back knowing what awaits me, but all I'm gonna do for now until then is carefully brush the cavities to make sure they don't get worse since they aren't causing any pain currently. If you read all this, thanks for your time."
Anxiety,Considering leaving job,Im currently hiding in the first aid room at the office. I cant do this anymore. I feel like im trapped. I dont want to leave because i need the money but i cant handle the office working life its affecting me mentally. I know its up to me to decide to leave or not but any advice on a how i see this through until i feel better ?
Anxiety,Do you have any suggestions for how to overcome my really bad fear of heights?,"I have issues with everything related to heights. At one point I tried working on it and it got a little better and then it just got way worse. I think its now worse that it ever has been. I won't even use an escalator at a two story mall near me or climb up a ladder. My most recent issue is that I've gone back to school. My classes are in the science building. The lectures are on the third floor, which doesn't bother me nearly as much because you can see the walkways and other buildings on that level. But, my labs are on the fourth floor. Last week was the first week of classes and I didn't do too bad going up for the lab. But, I went up yesterday and did horribly. I rode the elevator up and it had a little jolt when it got going and that was all that it took. I had a full blown anxiety/panic attack. I wanted to immediately leave but couldn't. I mean it was nausea, shaking, hyperventilating, heart pounding, felt like the floor was swaying under me, sweating profusely. I had to try to calm myself down, which didn't go that well and sit through a like hour and a half lecture while have anxiety attacks. I kept trying to tell myself that I've been higher than that and have been fine but it didn't work the best.

Sorry for the long post. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this get better? I felt hopeless with it yesterday. I like the college program I'm in but was even thinking of dropping out of it because of the height anxiety. How do you deal with your heights issues?

Is there something wrong with me that it bothers me that much and no one else that I saw on the floor had an issue like I did? My fear of heights embarrasses me a lot and makes me think there's something wrong with me."
Anxiety,Anxiety after taking medication,Does anybody get anxiety taking medication or thinking about medication. For instance I’m prescribed Valium and I get anxiety and panic attacks waiting for it to kick in or when I’m about to take it is this common?
Anxiety,Am I in anxiety denial?,"I have been suffering with constant nausea, some stomach discomfort, racing heart rate, tingling arms and hands. I wake up with it every morning, especially nausea and last few months heart racing. This has been going on for 18 months. I tend to get better through the day. Every GI test and blood work says I am ok mainly (small gastritis). I also had my gallbladder removed because high functioning. My primary wants me on an ssri, but  scared I tried one for few days didn’t do well. Hi dr had me try TCA antidepressant for gut and did ok but wore off. I’m just at lost.

Anxiety,Battling Forgetfulness,"I (27F) have been medicated for my anxiety for a few years now and I am finally starting to feel like I've regained control of my life which was previously spiraling. The only thing I still feel hasn't improved is my memory. My short term is...horrific. I just moved in with my girlfriend a few months ago and she is so patient and understanding with my memory issues, but it's causing me to forget to do housework I promised I'd do, or buy things at the store I agreed to buy and I feel terrible about it. She ends up just doing a lot of things herself and I know it's because she's worried I'll forget. I'm buying a to-do list today to fill out to help me remember better. List making usually helps a little as long as I remember to check the list. Does anyone else have useful tricks they use to help them remember tasks?"
Anxiety,I have a really specific anxiety trigger that I want to overcome but it's genuinely crippling,"I'm not usually an anxious person. I'm a professional wrestler, been training for a while and was absolutely fine.

The way our school is structured is you have beginners class, all the basics

Intermediate class, more or less like beginners but they'll throw in a couple more complicated moves or sequences

And advanced, this is full on, put on a wrestling match without planning anything. In this class you've got the best of the best.... and me

I was absolutely fine with training, really confident in the ring until I got invited to advanced, even before my session I was broken, the entire day before and day of training I'm a nervous wreck, literally shaking, vomiting, having a full break down and I genuinely don't know why, I hate being like this, it's completely taken the fun out of wrestling because I feel like this now going back into the beginners class as well, I can't even watch wrestling anymore without that knot in my stomach 

Thing is, it is just the wrestling, during lockdown our school closed and I joined a boxing gym to keep myself occupied, absolutely no fear, no anxiety, I'd get in the ring to spar or I'd have a bout, complete zen

You mention wrestling to me, I'm a quivering wreck. 

Is this something I should brute force my way through and hope it gets better?"
Anxiety,"I have the chance to immigrate to Canada, and I'm freaking out.","I decided to get evaluated on a whim to see if I qualify to immigrate to Canada. 

I did. I qualified. All I need to do is get a job and I can move across in as soon as 6 months.

All this is so overwhelming for me. It feels like it's moving too much too fast. I did this on a whim expecting nothing to come out of it, only to have this opportunity to change my life. And now I'm so afraid to take this step.

Who's going to want to hire me? I'm  a nobody, a below average plain Jane. I have no achievements to speak of, I do not have a good work record.

But a small part of me wants to take this a run at full speed. Escape my toxic mother. Escape the awful work culture that gave me PTSD. Start new, start fresh. 

It's crushing me. I don't even know what to do now. Where do I start? What's the next step? Where do I go from here? It's driving me crazy!

Please help..."
Anxiety,Would you date someone with HSV1 (herpes)? This cuases me anxiety,"I promise this is related to anxiety, because I have tried to google this question before when it was asked to the general population and most are not concerned at all about this. They say that 90% already have it and that most just don't have any symptoms.

I have always had a very big fear of catcthing an STD. I have gone to the doctors to have them examine skin tags and razor burns and all sort of stuff just to be sure.

Now I have been on two dates with a girl from tinder that told me she has HSV1. She said its 2 years since her last outbreak and that her ex she was with for 7 years never got it.

But I'm stuck in my tracks now, I don't know if I should call this off. The idea that her HSV can spread to my nether region is horryfing to me.

So I want to come here and ask people that may feel similar to me about this. Because my brain would interepret getting HSV as getting HIV. Like it's life ending. I know that's the anxiety and that I am overreacting, but we wouldn't care about our anxiety if we could just sit in it. 

I am already in therapy but that is slow going and my therapist is not a specialist for anxiety so I might ask for a remission.

But what would you do if you were in my situation?"
Anxiety,I just need to vent,I am literally crippled with anxiety 24/7 these last few days. I moved out of my parents home for the first time and I’ve been handling it horribly. Everyday is a struggle. And it’s all because of anxiety. It’s been making me nauseous so I haven’t ate anything. Which is giving me a huge fear of losing too much weight which feeds into my anxiety. I keep telling myself itll get better but I’m so sick of complaining to my family and boyfriend. I feel like I’m dragging them down with me. They don’t fully understand why I’m feeling this. I don’t even understand. I know I’m supposed to be having fun but I wake up every morning crying and wanting to give up. The worst part of anxiety is it prevents you from growing and becoming the person you want to be. I wish I could turn it off and explain to it that I’m fine here. But for now I’m just doing all I can to stick it out and not give up.
Anxiety,My weird anxiety triggers,"Throughout the years my anxiety have evolved into weirdly specific triggers. I would be afraid to eat in front of people. Fearing that my hands will shake or tremor. I will avoid eating foods like soup so it would not be obvious when my hands start shaking. 

Then it evolved to the weird fear of not being able to keep still. Whenever I’m in a situation whereby I’m required to keep still. I will have strong anxiety about it. And then my body will start to tremor. I haven’t went to a hair salon for years because of this. 

I could tell my therapist this problem because I’m so afraid that they will judge me for this weird problem"

Anxiety,I don’t enjoy summer at all?,"As ashamed as I am to admit this, I don’t enjoy summer. 

The main reason is that I hate showing off my body. My clothing style is casual and modest - I usually wear jeans or leggings and rarely get dressed up. I hate the pressure to dress nicely and wear skirts/dresses in summer. I hate going shopping and seeing stores full of clothes that just aren’t my style. 

I also don’t deal well with heat. Walking around on a hat day often makes me physically ill. A few weeks ago, I started vomiting after a day out in the sun. 

Another thing I don’t like about summer is the pressure to make plans and be out all of the time. Seeing people on social media having fun with their friends makes me feel inadequate. I never have exciting summer plans - like going on holiday. 

I’m 19 and most people my age look forward to summer. But I just don’t. I spent this whole summer in the house (apart from a few solo trips to my city centre.) I’m really glad we’re heading into Autumn/Winter. Can anyone else relate?"
Anxiety,Bad anxiety about ex?,"Would like to know if someone has the same… so I broke up over a year ago and I have moved on, been in a great new relationship for a while now but just thinking about my ex makes me nauseous. When he used to sent messages after we broke up (tried to stay friends for a while) I legit almost threw up because I became so anxious. It‘s now been better since I blocked him a few months ago because his presence in my life made me too nervous, and I hope time will make it easier to not get triggered that much"
Anxiety,Hey it’s me again.,"I posted last week about how I’m going through it right now and I just can’t seem to dig myself out of the hole I’m in. I received such kind messages, thank you. I really love this community because it makes me feel like what I’m feeling is normal because others feel it too.

I made the extremely tough decision to go back onto Prozac. It’s been a very long time since I’ve been on any medication for my anxiety so I don’t remember what exactly to expect. I’m on day 2. Im taking 10mg for the week and then bumping up to 20 next week. I’m so anxious. All I wanna do is sit on my couch. I haven’t had a real appetite in like 3 weeks and it’s making me even more anxious that I can’t eat. I just wanna feel normal again.

For those of you that take medication.. at what point should I expect to start feeling better? Tell me your success stories so that I can maybe see the light at the end of the tunnel."
Anxiety,How do u cope anxiety and panic when its too hot?,
Anxiety,Pls help me. I'm having a panic attack. I cant think clearly. I need help. Pls I'm begging.,"21F. I am having a major panic attack. Am I a p3do?

Anxiety,Monophobia or something else...?,"I quit weed 84 days ago and since quitting I've had extreme monophobia (fear of being alone). I spent the first 45 days of my recovery with my aunt, who lives upstairs from me. I was terrified to be alone in my apartment--I felt dread, extreme anxiety and unbelievable fear anytime I was alone. The only time I felt better was at night, when I was totally fine being alone. 

While the symptoms have lifted somewhat, I still get extremely anxious anytime I am alone in my apartment. I feel like being alone is somehow dangerous/scary/dreadful.

I know this is pretty odd, but I am wondering if anyone else experiences this problem. Do you live alone? How do you deal with this anxiety? Is there anything that makes it better?"
Anxiety,Anxiety killing creativity,"I work in a creative industry where I have to write/create every day. My anxiety in the past few months has been some of the worst it's ever been.  I'm in ""survival mode"" with the same fears running over and over in my head. I'm procrastinating, and honestly don't trust that what I hand in is hitting the mark. It's hindered my work, to the point where I'm wondering if I need to have a conversation with my boss. Any creatives have any advice?"
Anxiety,I Don't Know What to Do...,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder shortly after my mother passed away in 2013. Since then, I've been on medications and regularly seeing a psychotherapist for mood control, anger management, and trauma processing. I've never really considered myself an anxious person until I moved out on my own recently. 

Of course, this is a huge step in life, and any normal person would be nervous living by themselves in this big ol' world. But I've noticed a spiraling pattern recently. My therapist noticed some OCD tendencies developing in my behavior (anxiety--obviously--, counting, pulling my hair out during panic attacks, catastrophizing,  aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others, unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects, etc.) but didn't feel like I was diagnosable for the disorder. She claims that COVID-19s impacts on my day-to-day life have manifested these kinds of symptoms in my behavior. It doesn't help that I'm already a certified control freak.

The point is, I can't function. When I wake up in the morning, I'm fine. When I drive to work or class, I'm fine. But the moment I'm not doing anything--the moment I have a second to breathe--I panic. If I have finished my homework and all my quizzes, with the afternoon open to chill, I fall apart. Weekends are a nightmare because I'm this anxious mess for the entire day, as I don't know what to do with myself. I hate feeling like this. If there isn't anything to do at work, my chest gets very heavy and my breaths are shallow as I try not to go into a panic attack. My relationship is suffering because my anxiety is mistaken for moodiness; I would go out more often, but I'm currently broke, so the options are limited. I'm lost, and I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I deserve downtime to do what I want. 

But my brain won't let me. Either I do something, or I fucking implode."
Anxiety,Avoidence,"I was doing fine for a while, being able to go places and do things despite anxiety. But now, all of a sudden, for the past few days, I find my avoiding things again. My stomach's been hurting for a few days and I think it's just anxiety, so I tell people I'm sick, but I can't tell them I'm sick forever. I don't want to go out and face the world anymore. Last week was super stressful and I emotionally crashed and I think it triggered another existential crisis. Everything feels meaningless and pointless. I don't really want to do anything. I just want to stay in my bedroom and avoid people and the world. It feels safe in my room, it doesn't feel safe out there.

I am just feeling very overwhelmed today, and on the verge of tears."
Anxiety,Anxiety suddenly much worse,"Hey all,

So a little background.  Anxiety has always been something that affected me moderately, from time to time if things got really hectic and stressful in life.

However, lately that's taken a turn.  It is suddenly (and I mean suddenly) a daily occurrence for me.  It doesn't take much of anything to set it off, anything that is even moderately stressful puts me in this weird headspace where I'm just filled with worry.  My chest gets tight, I get a lump in my stomach, and all I can do is try to think good thoughts.  It feels crippling.

I do take Adderall for ADHD; however, skipping the medication for a few days didn't seem to change anything.  I know this isn't the place for medical advice, just venting and wondering if anyone else has experienced a sudden onset of anxiety like this?  If so, were you able to get past it?"
Anxiety,Taking a semester off to focus on therapy for my anxiety.... and it's making me anxious,"I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder paired with a heart condition, so that means I never know which one triggers the other but it's never one without the other and it gets pretty annoying. So I decided to take a semester off from university to go to therapy (I can't do both at the same time). So that means I'm moving back in with my mom so I had to give my 30-day notice to my landlord this morning and for some reason this made me so anxious. I have to laugh about it because it just confirmed that I made the right decision. Now I have to call my wifi provider to cancel my plan... I think I'll wait a few hours:') Thanks for letting me vent, I hope everyone has a good day!"

Anxiety,anxiety is killing me,"I can't spend 1 minute and feel calm, thinking about living now, I live comparing my life with the people in the videos I watch.

Anxiety,Getting so frustrated…,"I know you guys here get it, so I’ll vent openly. I got diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder when I was 18 and now I’m 32 with bouts of depression here and there. I’ve consistently seen a therapist since working on everything from CBT, to deep breathing and general talk. I’ve also had a psychiatrist oversee my meds which for the most part have been similar with a few change ups here and there throughout the years. Currently, I’m on a small dose of klonopin daily (0.5) and a medium dose of celexa. This was after a few years of trial and error with various others. I have also introduced marijuana into the mix and find it more helpful than anything else (at first) but being high eventually becomes the new norm and that’s another story… 

I’ve realized recently that when I’m asked how I’m doing, my answer is never based on how I’m actually doing. It’s based on how I’m doing this week vs last or this year vs last year. I suppose this is a positive way to look at it but in all honesty, I don’t feel “good.” And can’t even remember what “good” is. I wake up every day with a pit in my stomach and tight chest. I force myself to do everything because it’s what therapy has taught me. Get out of bed, workout, get out of the house… ok, we’ll I’ve done that everyday and I still feel like shit. 

The constant work is really starting to add another layer of depression into the mix and ultimately some resentment as well. I feel like I can’t truly appreciate or have fun with anything because I’ve literally had to force myself to do it. 

Last but not least, as I’m getting older and working out more, when my heart rate passes 120 or so, I launch into anxiety and depersonalization that can last hours. It doesn’t make me want to work out at all. I’ve also been working out consistently 5 days a week for almost a year hoping this would get better and it hasn’t. 

Super frustrating. I feel like every few years I have to figure out an entirely new regimen for relief and it’s really getting me down. I almost wish I did have an actual physical ailment that can be treated appropriately vs this shit. 

Ugh, such a downer but I know you guys get it. 🙏"
Anxiety,CBT take the wheel!,"I have my first cognitive behavior therapy appointment in a few days and I’m trying not to get my hopes up, but I’m really looking forward to it. I really think my brain is stuck in some kind of extremely negative thought loop that’s causing me serious anxiety and depression spirals that “conventional” advice doesn’t make an impact on. Its like a valve was opened and has been pouring out hell into my mind, and it just can’t get shut off. I work out. I spent time with friends. I have hobbies. I take it easy on the social media (besides Reddit lol). All those things really do is provide a momentary reprieve from the anxiety, and then it’s back to square one. Journaling helps the most, but certain things are just too difficult for me to put a pen and paper. I’ve tried anti depressants and long story short, it was horrible. I don’t have it in me to try those again because I don’t have the time or energy to handle things being that horrible again. I wouldn’t be surprised if they contributed to the problem. 

I’m tired of being a burden to everyone. My self esteem is in the pits. I know I haven’t made progress the past few months but it’s not for lack of trying…I really have been trying my hardest and I feel hopeless and inadequate. I recently started an extremely demanding grad program on top of working and it’s been hard. It’s so difficult to stay focused. My exasperated therapist recommended CBT and so I went off and made an appointment. Hope it works."
Anxiety,Anxiety over accomplishments??,"I don’t ever finish projects. I thought it was because I’m lazy or because I’m just not good at stuff. If/when i do finish things i give it away for free instead of sell it. Thats annoyed my friends and partner before. But i thought “ no I’m being nice”.

Recently i took on two big personal projects. I finished one of them. It was a fun thing to do and i felt I did a good job. 

I finished it then like a switch came anxiety. I held off putting it on a website to sell. And thats when i realized finishing personal projects i work hard on just eat me up inside.

Anyone else? Any tips?  

I talked to a loved one and put my project up to sell like my original purpose but i haven’t slept well. May take a higher dose of my meds today (dr says its fine to do that with what i take). 

But is completely finishing projects worth it??? I had fun making it why go thru this by putting it out there???"
Anxiety,Question: Symptom.. watery mouth ??,Is watery mouth a sign of anxiety ?? I am feeling really panicky right now - almost an attack and my mouth is watering up randomly along with my body shaking. Anyone else ????? :(
Anxiety,Properly started my new job today and made the effort to engage all my new colleagues who I interacted with in casual conversation,"Never thought I’d be able to do it but I’m very proud of myself. I made many people laugh, asked them questions about themselves and stayed conversing with a number of them for quite a while

I even made the effort to converse with people I was simply letting into the building 

I usually think of myself as an anxious person but after today I feel so much better. I really think I’ve worked on myself these last few years"
Anxiety,Getting tired of struggling everyday,I am at point that I just want to throw my hands up and say I give up every day I hope things get better but It does not.

Anxiety,Help asap,Anyone have quick tips to stop a panic attack and breathe normally? I’m by myself and really scared
Anxiety,People just rly fkn suck and I am so freaking exhausted by it,"Seriously everyone is just such an asshole there are no decent people anymore or they’re way too damn far and few between. Latest example being I’ve wanted to try microdosing mushrooms for a while to treat my severe anxiety among other shit but I no longer know anybody locally and in person so I had to use the dark web which I always find a nightmare cause well let’s be clear, anyone who makes a living selling drugs online is more than likely a Fkn scumbag…so I send 60 bucks worth of coin and it’s received but sure enough I get scammed the asshole pretends he didn’t get it blah blah blah…I’m trying something out of desperation and get taken advantage of and yet ppl tell me not to be so distrustful and cynical when it comes to people. Why not tho? People suck and there’s no justice in the world. I just don’t see the point anymore in living like this. There is no point to being alive if you have no quality of life and no joy. I fail to see why it’s considered brave just to stay alive for the sake of being alive and breathing. Raw fucking deal"
Anxiety,Everything feels weird and I feel like I'm losing my mind,"So, idk what is the reason of this and I'm afraid that I might have some serious mentall illness and I'm really scared and anxious about it.  


Everything feels so weird. It's hard to describe, but a lot of things feel idk fake/just weird?  
 Like everything is fake

It started when I had bad LSD trip (I took it 4 times in my life, last time 9 months ago). Sometimes I have something like flashbacks from it? Idk it's hard to explain but randomly  i just get this chill that runs through me and then I feel like tripping for second.   


My brain feels like it's going to explode. Sometimes when I'm lying in bed I have feeling like my head is going to burst from my spine and it's very weird.   
Everything also feels pointless. Like, when I'm doing something I randomly get that ""crash with reality"" thoughts and I'm keeping asking myself why am i doing it and what's the point of everything.Z

I also feel disconnected from everything. It really bothers me.   


Also I doubt it's related but my feet and hand often feel really shaky (Or like  electrified idk it's hard to explain).  


I also get really stressed"
Anxiety,Starting grad school,"I've known this was going to come and the anxiety was only going to get worse (I have severe social anxiety, depression, OCD and even was agoraphobic for awhile). But I have goals, too. I want to achieve my goals. 

As the date I start looms closer and I get invited to meet more people, lunches, brunches, etc. My anxiety is creeping back up to a scale 11. I'm on medicine, have been for a decade or so, but it only helps so much as I m sure many know... I don't have much to ask or anything but I just wanted to share what I'm going through right now. Heavy breathing. Over heating. fear. Nausea... and much more. Trying to center myself and I will make it through this. But man anxiety is so hard...

Anyone else have any similar experiences, going to grad school, starting a new job, anything that you want to share. I would love to read some comments that are similar to my experiences if possible. 

And in the meantime I'll keep going one day at a time lol."
Anxiety,"I think have Social Anxiety and OCD, please offer advice","I'm so sure I have social anxiety that has interfered with the way that I have lived my life and I feel like it is the reason I have recently been broken up with. I have always felt scared to approach people, to go into the old grocery store I used to work at just because I don't want to see people, I'm also in a small town so I don't like doing things in this town because I feel like I'll see somebody from high school, I have such an awful problem with looking people in the eyes, I truly only feel comfortable when I am in my room with my door shut on my Xbox. 

My life has been great I haven't really had any trauma and the worst thing that has happened to me is just some minor bullying because I have a little twitch and that was in Middle School and a little bit in high school, really stemming just from one person that I cut off, he was supposed to be a friend. 

It's not impossible for me to be in social situations such as a classroom for going to the gym, it's more so when I am going to be the center of attention or people are focusing on me, or talking to somebody new or approaching somebody is next to Impossible and when I do my voice gets shaky I feel like I start to choke up and I get super sweaty, even if it's just one person that I'm in a class with and I have to ask them what our assignment was, if I haven't really established a relationship with them it's so hard to speak to them. 

It's weird because I can see it from the outside and I know a lot of things that I can do to try to make it better and techniques to help me succeed in some cases but it's like no matter how much I know or try to be mindful of it there is always some part of me that holds back or is going to choke up or forget what I was trying to say.

The reason that I'm really trying to search Within Myself and figure this out is because I feel like this is the leading cause for my last relationship ending, I feel like my social anxiety got the best of me and it affected her so much that she ended it. It seems a little different but looking back on it now I don't see how it wasn't social anxiety but I can explain a couple of examples. At first going over to her place and being myself wasn't a problem but it was like after I got comfortable then I started to be less and less open in silly in fear I don't even know really just something in the back of my head. She was super silly and was able to do cringey stuff and laugh at all and I feel like I forced my social anxiety on her by trying to minimize some stuff she was doing because it made me socially anxious. Also mixed with the pandemic led me to being too comfortable in my own house so that whenever I left I would just get home sick and feel uncomfortable because I had been in my house so long and that really being the only place that I feel like I don't have to have a guard up or feel like I'm performing in public.

I also feel like I have slight OCD because I am very particular about some things and a lot of them are small and really shouldn't even matter and I push that on her a lot too. And it would just be super small stuff that I know I probably should have just let go but it's like it would eat at me until I said something. 
I just wanted to try to be the best person I could be and I think that is out of fear of failure and how I will be looked at and I feel like my social anxiety really drives that, it's so hard to be myself and there's a very very select few that I can, I can't really even be myself in front of my parents. I feel so dumb because I couldn't see this stuff whenever I was in the relationship and it just feels so crappy to not be able to work on the saints that I didn't realize, even though I am totally willing to work on everything and sacrifice anything for her and I am willing to see my issues and work on them. 

Any time that she was having issues with her mental health or just anything in life I would always try to help her and just try to improve even though sometimes I could be critical and demeaning sometimes with the small little stuff that I should have let go. I just feel like it would be so much better if we could just communicate and really come to an understanding and even though I don't really want to accept that social anxiety is what has been doing this to me I'm willing to accept that and get help for it it just seems so unfair to me that it ended like this even though I put her through this and it being especially difficult because we weren't aware completely that I really had these problems because I will try to communicate with her but I feel like I held back some things because of my social anxiety and I just had anxieties in the back of my head and I do constantly that hold me back and have hurt the people around me which I I have such an issue with forgiving myself for because I only have good intentions and I don't want to hurt anybody and I want to make everybody feel good about themselves and be happy. 

Maybe I should have seen it coming but it seems like she just ended it so suddenly and I wish that I could really explain to her that I understand where I fail and could really make her believe me but it's like she just cut me off and it feels like she wants nothing to do with me and that hurts so deeply because of the love I thought we had, maybe she is just so hurt she's running away, I want to really explain to her how I feel and that I would go to any lengths to try to improve myself and be a person that she deserves. 
I know there are many great things about me and I  know that i have helped her in many many ways too, but I feel like because I didn't really know the extent of my anxieties because I always seemingly brushed them to the side or made excuses for things when I really just didn't want to admit that I have issue, actual issues that inhibit myself and those around me. 

Also I feel like this led to a decrease in sexual activity, not to say I didn't want to but we mostly hung out at my house and I was always too anxious to do anything big out of fear of them hearing and I was always anxious of what she thought during anything that kinda held me back, that probably had a big part in it too. I feel so awful I let being overly critical about stupid stuff and social anxieties hurt her and get in the way of how I live

If there is any advice you all can think of or ask any questions to try to confirm if I have social anxiety, though I'm sure I do, I'm open to all comments, criticism, and help. Ask me anything about the relationship because I'm still very hurt by it and venting helps especially if I know understand if this was the true problem and will continue to be in the future. And this is all stuff on my side because I'm willing to get outside perspective on myself and try to be the best I can be, of course she has problems too and I could talk about some if anyone really wanted to know so they could judge the situation better, I'm just not so sure she is willing to put in the work that I am. Thanks in advance ❤"

Anxiety,School phobia,"Hey everyone, I guess I just wanted to vent today and see if anyone else understands. Back in highschool I had real bad school phobia. I was terrified of the school building and going to classes. I was also terrified of getting bullied. Girls in my class said small comments to me but I still considered that to be somewhat bullying. Although I’m done with highschool I can’t help but to feel sad about how it turned out for me. My grades were terrible because I missed so many days of school. I just really hated school and I dealt with so much anxiety. Has anyone ever had school phobia ? What was your experience like ? My little brother is starting highschool and I’m afraid for him because of what I went though but he seems pretty chill and calm about it like it doesn’t care I’m so happy for that but I still fear at times.!"

So i decided to adopt a cat to help with my loneliness. I adopted a 3 month old kitten from a rescue center, and i haven’t really been able to rest since. It is my first cat and he really has been hard to deal with, he has been destroying stuff all day and causing a ruckus. I know he is a kitten and thats what kittens do but he has really overwhelmed me and i have been crying nonstop for days because he makes me feel like this is too much for me.

Anxiety,(Update) Interview for a job!,"(Update) 

Yesterday I had the interview with a company here in my small town! They really enjoyed me and offered me the job right there on the spot. I feel this one will be a start in the right direction as it involves chemistry and computer work which in the last post was something I had said felt confident in this industry. Wish me luck, with whatever the flow goes onto! Hope everyone here can find a little confidence in anything today as well! Keep up the work, I know this really isn't easy. Find your breath and Flow.

Anxiety,Heart flutters,"I've been having heart flutters at random times of the day, sometimes a few in a span of a few hours. My question is how do I know if it's just anxiety or if its smtg heart related. Deep breaths does make me feel better, and I do have pretty bad anxiety. Usually happens when I exercise, which had me worried but it also happens when I hear loud noises out of nowhere or just when I'm in bed. Doctor visits are very pricey where I am from, so ecg and what not is my last option. My doctor have advised taking a thyroid test, which I'll be doing next month or so. Please, any insight is helpful to me."
Anxiety,"Anyone here take MSM. If so, how has it helped you?",
Anxiety,Am I a bad friend/person?,"First sorry for my English, some grammar might be wanky. Secondly I recently stuggle a lot because I live alone for the first time in my life in a new town, where I know no one. And lastly are my thoughts and feelings all over the place because I think I might have undiagnosed ADHD and Anxiety, or maybe I am just weird, I don't know.


I recently got in contact with a very good friend of mine, with whom i didn't talk with for over a year (let's call him Ben). He was/is one of my best friends. I introduced him to my female best friend (lets call her Alex), the first person in my life that understands me so well and shares so many interest with me. We all share a common intrest in video games (PC) and play together often, almost daily. They both recently broke up with their SO and I immediately felt that Ben had a thing for Alex, but I didn't think much of it at the time. 

Once, I confessed to him that I had a crush on him a long time ago and that I wouldn't be aversed if he would feel the same someday, knowing fully well that I was in the never ending friendzone, but I was glad that I told him anyway. Alex also was part of that conversation, but I don't think she really cared, because they started dating 2 weeks later without me knowing. While playing with them and talking with them on discord, I felt the tension between them, tbh at that time I thought they might make a really cute couple, they were sweet to each other and they had so much in common.....but I was more afraid of what would happen once they started going out....would there still be space for me? what happens if they break up, will I lose Ben again?......

I asked Ben if he had feelings for her, because it was kinda obvious, but he didn't want to admit it at first because of my confession a few weeks back, but I assured him, that even if I had a crush on him right now my feelings wouldn't matter if they loved each other....or so I thought....
A day later my mood dropped, I cried and talked to Alex about it...that I even wished that the two of them never met, because I feel like losing them and especially her. She was really considered and assured me, that she would always be there for me and that I am the first friend she ever felt so connected with. I was happy but felt bad for having such thoughts, I wanted them to disappear, but they didn't, not then, not now.

A week later I realised that talking to her made me feel better and less anxious, but a day later they announced to me that they were dating, I told them in all honesty that I was happy for them, they are so similar and cute together, it had to happen, but I also told them I was jealous...why? I dont know if it is because I myself am single, of if I really have/had a crush on Ben or that I knew I would spend less time with Alex from know on. I tried to hide my bad feelings and started to mask them, always staying happy and understanding, i think rather successfully. But the last three days were tough.....they started to hang out without me more often, something completely normal and things that couples should do as much as they want........is what I am saying and should be feeling honestly.....but I feel alone.....I don't have many friends, I struggle with asking others to hang out, Ben and Alex are the ones I spent 90% of my time with and its hard for me to see them be happy without me.....

All my thoughts are all over the place, I wish for them to be happy, I love them both so much....but on the other hand I wish they never met, or leave me behind. They don't realise that I struggel...but thats because I dont want to tell them, I shouldn't be their stepping stone, I shouldn't be like broken glass laying around them.....my feelings shouldn't matter when they want to be alone or if they ignore me because they are freshly in love and only have eyes for each other...I understand, I was there too.....but it hurts....

I cry for the third day, not knowing what to do, I dont want to burden them, I don't want to hurt them, but I feel lost, lonely and worthless. Am I a bad person? Am I a shitty friend? I dont wanna be the special snowflake that needs special care because she can't keep her feelings in place....my depression keeps getting the better of me and my anxiety takes over....I feel like disappearing forever....but for what reason? This is no reason to make me feel like dying, it's a stupid reason and I want to cast these feelings aside, but it seems impossible..............help"
Anxiety,Is This Pain I’m Feeling Normal?,"Hello everyone, I (21M) recently have been developing anxiety and have had 2 panic attacks in the last 6 months, the most recent one being this weekend on Saturday evening.

I understand anxiety impacts everyone differently, but does this sound normal or familiar to anyone? I would appreciate any advice. Thank you all."
Anxiety,Scared that anxiety will ruin my semester abroad,[removed]
Anxiety,I need help,So i do not clinicly know if this is anxiety and i normally am not anxious of doing things but its my time to enter a university i really want to go to and the entrance exam scare me to death i was doing check ups with a doctor and my heart rate went to 140bpm which as much as i know is like wayyy too high but the problem is i do not feel the jump in bpm but rather like losing my focus which i need for the tests. Is there any atleast temporary solution to this that i can practice for few days so im calmer when the actual test starts
Anxiety,Just not feeling right and need to vent,"No matter how well I think my anxiety is controlled, it will still manage to pop up out of the blue and mess with me. I'd say it happens about once a month or so. Yesterday I just felt so off, that paranoid, self-conscious anxiousness. Can't concentrate, tight chest, cry at the drop of a hat. I had a meltdown for no reason, and felt so guilty that my boyfriend had to deal with me like that, he handled it really well, but I don't like putting people through that. I'm still not feeling right today, and I dread going home to him to admit that. I feel like I'll cry again for no reason. I'm frustrated that it seems anxiety hangs on like this, coming back to surprise me when everything seems fine. It feels like I'm stuck with it forever no matter what I do, and I feel like I'm a bad person for having this, and bothering people with this problem that's so ridiculous and illogical."
Anxiety,Getting a blood test in a couple days and very anxious,"As title says I am going to get a blood test in a couple days (on Thursday). I am anxious. The combo of needles, anxiety, preparing beforehand, waiting all day, what if I pass out, feeling light headed, all that… The funniest part about all this is that the blood test is for my anxiety. 

I’ve gotten a blood test once before, for the same thing, but that was a few years ago. I only felt lightheaded after, and I’ve never fainted due to needles or blood. Still, I want to be prepared for all of it as much as I can. Right now all I can think to prepare is headphones so I have music to listen to, to keep me distracted.

Does anyone have any tips for this? I know I will have to drink lots of water beforehand. Is there anything else I could do to help with the anxiety and expected lightheadedness?

Thank you in advance"
Anxiety,I accomplished so much today!,"Okay!! so!!

I decided to go to town today by myself because I wanted some exercise (tons of walking) and I felt really depressed so I decided nope! I'm going out today! So here's a list of things that I did by myself!!! WITHOUT ANXIETY MIGHT I ADD??!! AAA!!

But before that...

I did my phone interview! I'll know soon if i got it (manifest manifest), and phones are a HUGE phobia for me but I conquered it like I knew i could!!

okay so back to the adventure in town..

• Bought my own train ticket (not from a screen but from a person, he was v friendly)

• i encountered a group of kids who kept yelling at me probably because i dress fairly gothic but I just kept walking without getting upset, anxious or angry

• A lovely sweet girl complimented my bag! (its an unlucky charms bag from killstar) and i was shocked but i was like!!!! ty!!!!!

• said excuse me multiple times instead of just standing there awkwardly. i made sure i was being heard!

• at one point i was digging in my bag and some stuff flew out and instead of having a mini panic attack about looking stupid, I just shook it off and continued bcs stuff being self conscious that stuff happens sometimes

• ok so my favourite part of today was getting a mother earth statue from my fave shop and I held conversation with the man working there (so so sweet hes so kind) and I asked ""hey do you have this statue boxed up?"", said how I admire it all the time AND said ""have a great day! thank you!!"" LIKE?? i ALWAYS want to say that and seem confident and i finally did it!!!

• i ordered my own food and waited in a crowd of people!!!

I'm just so?? happy?? im??

I'll try to post some photos of my new statue in the replies but im not sure if its allowed. hopefully its there bcs i love it so much and its a reminder to me that im getting better and that i can do anything i set my mind to!!

Anxiety,How can I relate to someone? i want to like someone but i feel like no one could stand me for so long and would break up with me quickly,
Anxiety,Should I follow her back?,"So I met this wonderful amazing person F(21) and we met in early 2019. We used to text often earlier on and since the beginning on this year 2021, she hasn’t responded to me since. 

She told me she suffers from really bad anxiety so she doesn’t like texting.

Since then she’s liked every picture I post on Instagram and every occasional tweet to remind me that she still looks at them. But she hasn’t spoken or texted me since.

Well this week I decided to unfollow her just on Twitter because I disagree with some of the stuff she posted and I needed a break from seeing her tweets for my own mental health. She deactivated all her social media account (FB and IG) the next day except Twitter. 

I’m worried that I might have done something that is going to set her to spiral down. I still wanted to keep her on FB and the Gram. 

How would someone with anxiety deal with this and is there any way I can make up for it. I didn’t think she was going to deactivate all her other accounts because of this. (I double checked, I’m not blocked).

Am I hurting her? And how can I fix this?"
Anxiety,anxiety is getting really bad,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello

I'm really struggeling right now. My anxiety is getting in the way of my everyday life. I don't leave the house, I don't want to go out with friends because I keep convincing myself that they all hate me and I am even going to skip a redo exam and just do it next year just because it is an oral exam and I can't handle the stress right now. 

I'm also so ashamed to tell my parents. They're never going to understand why I (probably) failed all off my exams. I think I'm going to keep it to myself if it turns out bad and just lie. 

I was thinking about going to the doctor to get some medication because i'm really sick of it. I thought about Lexapro because I've read a lot of good experiences. 

Can somebody tell me more about Lexapro and how it affected your day to day life? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

Anxiety,"i am at a point now, where my anxiety is beginning to ruin my life","from a person diagnosed with anxiety, depression, cptsd with a family history of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. for a rough background: i’ve always been a very anxious person (cheers dad for traumatising me throughout my early childhood). in july of 2019 after months of severe depression, i finally sought help and went on antidepressants. my anxiety at this point was not too bad, i would have an attack every now and again, but i never had any symptoms that interfered with my daily life. felt foggy on antidepressants, very uninteresting time in my life. the beginning of january 2021, i lost my best friend to suicide and ever since then, i haven’t been the same. i felt quite numb, and felt very little symptoms of anxiety or depression, as my whole world was turned upside down by grief, and grief alone. in june of 2021, i decided to quit antidepressants cold turkey to gain more clarity on my own feelings and give myself an unmedicated chance to heal. i am now beginning to think that this was the worst decision of my life. 

the first two weeks off the antidepressants (40mg fluoxetine daily), i felt amazing. i felt happy, my brain was clear and i felt like i had more control over myself and my actions. fast forward about 2 &amp; 1/2 weeks after i quit my antidepressants, i had my first drink since coming off them. i had a huge panic attack, thinking i had something wrong with my lungs and was physically unable to breathe for about a week (scans were clear and respiratory swab came back clear also). then came the worst part. i remember getting in the car one day, and all of a sudden i felt like i was in a dream. i felt like the world around me was fake, and like i was going to just drop dead if i let the dreamy feeling take over me. this has not gone away and i have been dealing with it for over a month and a half now. my head spins, my legs get weak and i just feel like crying. the best thing i can compare it to is being really stoned and needing to pretend to be sober in front of your parents, or you’ll die. i find myself struggling to bring myself back from these episodes where i feel like i am a seperate entity from the world around me, and i am constantly feeling as if i am going to die. the feeling of dreaming has gotten so strong that i pinch myself before i go to the toilet, just to make sure i am truly awake, or don’t speak when i’m out in public, in fear that i will zone out and say something i don’t mean. 

i feel like i am losing my mind here, and i really don’t know what to do anymore. i don’t want to live in a world that seems fake, constantly feeling as if i am going to die at any given moment.

if anyone has any similar experiences, let me know because i’m at a loss here. psychologist just said it’s DP-DR and my doctor blames it on generalised anxiety disorder. psychiatrist is about an 8 month wait :( 

tl:dr - bad anxiety and want to know if anyone has had any similar experiences or got any advice :)"
Anxiety,Damned if you do,"Don’t overanalyze someone? Forgive and forget? You’ll probably get burned.

Overanalyze someone? Drop people after bad situations? Congrats, you’ve just overreacted.

The correct choice does not exist. Just constant internal dialogue"
Anxiety,28m Double Stroke survivor,"I naturally assumed 2020 was bad, with a global pandemic sweeping the planet and my girlfriend at the time undergoing an operation on her heart to save her life. And then 2021 came along. But here I am, fighting.

This year from January 2021 I have split up from my girlfriend of 5 years, left my flat in the city and moved back to my family home (I am extremely lucky and thankful for this safety net). I suffered a brain haemorrhage in March which seemingly had no lasting physical consequences. I returned to work on a part-time basis. At the time I even managed to start dating a girl who I thought the world of, right?. After coming close to a seemingly life threatening event, it was safe to say I felt great again. 

We decided to have some time away and stay in a hotel not too far away. At 2am in the morning she left and didn't return. This girl turned out to be an extreme alcoholic and turned out to be dating other people. What I didn't reveal was that 5 weeks after returning to work I suffered what is now known to be a stroke. I was left in the hotel waiting for her to return 2 weeks after having a stroke with a severely weakened body. I reported her missing, she was found at 7am in an ambulance. I still don't know the reason for her disappearance. Because of the condition I was in, I could only hobble across the City to return her belongings. My head was messed up by the haemorrhage and this unbeknownst to me, had affected my thought processes quite drastically. I was originally misdiagnosed as having Functional Neurological Disorder and I was diagnosed correctly 10 weeks later. 

The stroke has left me with a severely weakened right side, and has affected my speech and energy levels. I have developed depression and anxiety and am on the waiting list for Social Anxiety CBT.

I'm not here to say you need to feel pity for me, as you only have to pick any thread and you will find someone who has been through so much more. But tomorrow I will begin my course of anti-anxiety medication and I am once again hopeful and excited 3 months later about the prospect of life as I once knew it, no, much much more.

Tl;dr 
Rebuilding after a 5-year break-up, change of home, brain haemorrhage and a stroke in the same year. Anti-anxiety medication from tomorrow and I'm feeling a little better now."
Anxiety,Bad work experience tanked my public speaking progress - should I up my dose of beta blockers?,"I'm a competent/confident one-on-one talker, but the second I have to talk to more than four other people, it's like my brain shuts off. 

My throat swells up and I lose control over my tongue and jaw, and I start to choke on my words. Even when I can get the words out, my brain can only focus on keeping my mouth moving and doesn't have the bandwidth to think about what I'm going to say next. 

A few months ago, I had to give a big virtual presentation about my job for everyone at my office (about 50 people). I was nervous, obviously, but I managed to get a prescription for propranolol (20mg). I took a pill before the presentation and amazingly it helped. I still felt nervous but managed to get through the presentation and Q&amp;A without any stammering. It felt like a real breakthrough, and I was excited about what beta blockers would mean for my career.

A week later I heard from my boss that one senior colleague was upset about something I'd said regarding one of her projects. I rewatched the presentation (it was recorded) and couldn't understand what I had said that had upset her. I had complimented her work and, a little while later, criticized *something I had done* related to her project (but it was something she had no input on/control over). Maybe she misheard/misunderstood me. I showed the video to my wife, mom, and sisters (all successful, professional women) to see if there was anything I (a man) should have said or done differently. They said I was perfectly professional and respectful. 

I apologized anyway for any offense caused, and she said it was water under the bridge, but since then I've been terrified of speaking publicly at work, even with propranolol. I used to feel that if I could just get the words out, everything would be fine. Now I worry that even if I get the words out, I might still fuck it all up. It feels like all that extra worrying has sent me back to square one.

Should I take a second pill (I weigh more than 100kg, maybe 20mg isn't enough)? See a therapist? Any other tips for public speaking anxiety? I'm concerned about how far I can advance in my career if I'm too terrified of screwing up to ever speak publicly again."
Anxiety,i hate being in this human flesh suit,the thought of people being able to perceive me and see what i look like makes me want to throw up every time it comes to mind. why do people have to see me even if it’s just a quick glance? what are they thinking of me when they look at me? are they judging my character? my brain explodes from thinking a million questions until i can’t even produce coherent thoughts anymore when i go outside and catch one pair of eyes looking my way
Anxiety,Everyone hates me,"I dunno why it just hit me today. I know I’m particularly unstable right now so I don’t think I should trust my judgement currently but I feel like everyone hates me.
Rightfully too. I don’t reply to them for months, I’m selfish and make everything about myself and fail to be a good friend in the most basic ways. I find myself incredibly boring and uninteresting and couldn’t blame anyone for feeling burdened by talking to me at all. At the same time they care enough to keep talking and all I do is regress.
I’m self destructive and exhausting.
I keep feeling like everyone only tried bc they feel sorry for me. I feel I deserve to have been bullied and that I only wasn’t bc I’m too soft and weak that I was pitied too much to bully. I feel nobody trusts me and that my politeness is a cover and that I’m an attention seeker for trying to express myself and no one really likes me. I want to tell them I’m sorry but I feel that’s just trying to seeek attention too. I don’t have anyone I trust to talk to bc I’m convinced everyone finds me annoying secretly and sometimes not so secretly and I’m going to lose everyone. Everyone hates me. I think they talk to each other about me and say things behind my back bc they don’t really like me and they’re trying to leave me. I love them all so much but sometimes I think I put them on a pedestal but then if they don’t reply soon enough I hate them bc they hate me back but then I remember how loved I am but it can’t be real bc I don’t deserve love so I hate them and I hate me. I feel guilty for not loving them enough and mad for not being loved enough and mad for loving them too much.
How can I feel so strongly about both facts if they are paradoxical?
Kinda feels like I’m dying. Like my insides want to explode. I want to kill myself and everyone else."
Anxiety,My girlfriend broke up with me,"I was in a relationship, my first ever, over the course of the past one year. It was an interesting time to get into one with the pandemic raging on and I thought I had met someone who will be with me forever. 

We used to talk for hours and I would share with her about how my anxiety, stress and self esteem problems are something I've worked on my, over the course of my 20s and now at 31, I feel that I'm in a better place in being able to identify these problems of mine, talk about it and deal with them. 

However, she would find it hard to discuss any emotional or mental health aspects about life at length, to her all these problems you deal within a day or two, and you march on being positive with life. I used to tell her that I almost always need time to deal with my issues and talking about it helps me deal with whatever it is I'm thinking. We work together as well so, she would see the side of me that gets frustrated with work or anxious when I had to a difficult task. 

There were fights where she would stop having a discussion if it went on about any topic for more than an hour, she would tell me she doesn't want to be in the relationship when ever things got even a little heated. Whereas I would never go there, I always wanted to keep the relationship going and figure out whatever it is we had a difference of opinion on. I would get on calls with my friends and cry about how I felt when she would do that to me, I would stress about it and be in tears cause I didn't know what I should do to make things alright and eventually I would be scared to bring up anything which I wanted to talk about, fearing my concern or opinion would make her feel uncomfortable and she wouldn't want to talk. 

However, I thought we would get by like this, grow and understand each other better. We constantly supported each other in our endeavors. But recently, she called me out for not being able to deal with my problems and change my behaviour in the one year that we dated. I told her that I have made strides to being better but it's not entirely fair to tell me that I should have solved all my mental health issues in a year. 

She refused to acknowledge that, she said she wanted to go back to being peaceful and not have to hear my problems. She asked me to give her space and then broke up with me over text. I pleaded with her to to be me a chance to speak to her but she kept insisting she didn't want that because she didn't want to fix this. I left her alone for a week, I spoke after that with her and she told me that she felt better not having to hear me at the end of the work day and was in a better space. It broke me to hear that and I was left wondering how and why she could suddenly sound like she wanted to do nothing with me. 

I had to move on after that and my anxiety would kick in randomly during the day and night. I kept crying and texting her seeking her attention but her responses were single words and sounded like someone I never knew. 

It's been a while now but I haven't been texting her, I occasionally wonder what she is up to or miss her when I'm alone. I can feel my chest surge with an emotional stress and I wish she would reach out to me. All this is even affecting my mental ability to put in the extra effort at work. 

I hope I can find the strength to cope with this and not fall down a pit of despair and sadness."
Anxiety,Sources or tips for healthy coping mechanisms for unmedicated anxiety disorder?,"I have a friend currently undiagnosed, but im 80% sure has the disorder, since she manifests a lot of the physical symptoms like the attacks, difficulty in breathing, etc apart from her obvious mental health decline (possibly also has depression, has expressed suicidal thoughts a lot recently). She’s still trying to get herself an appointment for diagnosis, so as of the moment she’s unmedicated.

Her physical symptoms happen almost everyday at this point, and has been disruptive for her. I was wondering if anybody here can share sources which she herself can use to at least ease the symptoms? Or share your own coping mechanisms for when you were still unmedicated? 

Hoping for your advice!"
Anxiety,How can I stop crying during and after my panic attacks?,It's almost like waves as one second I will feel in control and then randomly it hits and I start crying again. Then when I think it's over I cry. I work in retail so I don't really want to be crying Infront of customers so I go off and take a break which is a little issue as it takes like 30+ mins for this to stop. I'm there like I want to go back to work but then my brain goes nope let's cry again and it sucks.
Anxiety,Messed up an online test due to anxiety,Even after studying.. unnecessary worrying which was out of my control has cost me another good Opportunity. I hope no one gets anxiety...  I feel terrible now
Anxiety,Witnessing a tragic death,"A few weeks ago an incredibly tragic death happened at the flat where i live. A neighbour woman i knew from the 6th floor fell to her death and i was there to witness it. I heard her scream then i heard her hit the ground, and after that i saw her body. It was all an accident, not a suicide but after that day i've been feeling 100 times more scared, anxious. I'm having trouble realizing that everything around me is real, i feel like i'm playing a video game if that makes sense. Nothing feels real and i'm not sure what to do. I feel sick in my stomach, mind, heart when i think about this. I had death anxiety before this incident but now it's on a whole another level. Just wanted a place to vent i guess and hear other peoples thoughts, thanks for reading"
Anxiety,Active vs passive negative feelings.,"I’ve been thinking about it recently and I realized there’s two types of negative feelings: active and passive. Active is things like anxiety, pain, fear, anger, annoyance. Passive is things like sadness, depression, boredom, and tiredness. 

After a whole year or more of experiencing passive negativity because of the covid lockdown, the last 2 months of active negativity have been 100x worse. 

I had a panic attack one day for no reason in the shower, and ever since that day I experience random pains and sensations in my head, chest, neck, and legs non stop.

I wish I could go back to just being sad I can’t see my friends. Now I feel like I’m always in danger and going to die. I can’t sleep properly anymore, I have to go walk around every 10 minutes to clear my head. It’s horrible. I wish I was just sad."

Anxiety,Buspar/Hydroxyzine and alcohol,"I just was started on Buspar and Trileptal and have some big drinking milestones coming up in college life (boyfriends 21st, senior vegas trip, etc)...I drank with no change on Lexapro and hydroxyzine and they never did a thing to me and when I go out and drink like I go out and drink, I don’t want to really worry about this but I’ve recently for some reason developed major anxiety about meds? I literally had probably 8 drinks or so on both meds and they never did a thing to me but these are new meds. I’m not as worried about the trileptal, more the buspar, but I’m on a super low dose and am ofc going to consult with my doc about this, she knows I’m in college and I’m not ready to give up partying quite yet...any advice? I was told I could maybe skip the buspar for those days since I’ve gotten the anxiety pretty regulated now? Just looking for some advice, not really a rant- I know you’re not supposed to drink on any of these, but I still like to enjoy a good night out. Also for anyone out there concerned about drinking and hydroxyzine I swear I didn’t change a thing, had shots on it and everything, and it didn’t do a thing."
Anxiety,Does anyone experience night panic attacks?,I am currently awake after waking up in the middle of the night in pure panic. It feels so overwhelming and presents mainly as nausea and fast heartbeat. It’s the second time this has happened. I am very familiar with daytime panic but it waking me up is a recent occurrence.
Anxiety,Hyper-Awareness of being Conscious,"Hey there guys - I only use the trigger warning as this can trigger feelings of depersonalization. The point of this post is to create a discussion on the feelings of hyper-realization of being conscious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to suffer from depersonalization  - real bad (if you know, you know). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've contained these feelings and learned how to deal with them. I guess containing isn't the word for this as that makes it worse so I guess I have fully relaxed into the idea that I am a human and stuck inside a human body. But, the awareness creeps up on me and causes anxiety from time to time. You could describe the feeling as a lucid dream-like state throughout your daily life. 

&amp;#x200B;

There comes a fear with this feeling for some reason, almost like a deep loneliness. But, through life and standing up everyday to the feeling of fear I have calmed my mind and would like to ask - anybody else feel like this? I'd love to talk about how everybody has been dealing with these feelings. 

Just want to end this read on one great note, which is to understand that behind this constant fight-or-flight headspace is to remember that your body stands perfectly fine and breathing - this is all in your head. You are fine!"
Anxiety,How do you deal with Intrusive Thoughts?,"99% of Anxiety is caused by my consistent yet unwanted negative Intrusive Thoughts! When my Intrusive Thoughts reach its peak then my anxiety is also really bad to the point where I get really bad chest pain or experience derealization/depersonalization. But for those that don't know what Intrusive Thoughts are btw the quick google definition is, ""Intrusive thoughts are **unwanted thoughts that can pop into our heads without warning**,  at any time. They're often repetitive – with the same kind of thought  cropping up again and again – and they can be disturbing or even  distressing."" And that definition basically happens to me and I hate the feeling.  So what kind of advice do you guys have that have can help deal with such thoughts? Thank you and I appreciate any help."
Anxiety,"Feeling sad, anxious and self-loathing when in a group","Does anyone else experience sadness, anxiety and self-loathing when they're out with a group? I always  get quieter in a group which makes me think i'm not fun enough which in turn makes me feel sad and hate myself. And because of that i get more quiet and a bit cranky and then i just want to go home and be with myself. It's really bothering me and i don't know how to stop it..."
Anxiety,Anyone have techniques to lower anxiety?,"I’m 25(m) and I have a slightly higher than avg. level of anxiety normally or at least I think I do. Currently a 4 month break between my SO and I is coming to a close and I’ve only been able to sleep an hour at a time. I’m forcing myself to eat and my heart and chest have been building and building these last few days and now at the end of this where anytime she could text me to discuss things I’m about to explode.

I’ve been off and on crying these months and I can’t stop. I woke up today as we are supposed to talk in the beginning of august to what felt like a panic attack. 

I know that I need time and I need to breathe but I feel absolutely trapped and scared. I keep thinking I’m done crying but every week I discover I’m wrong. I wish there was something I could do to get myself to stop. I know life moves on either way things go between her and I but I’m failing to control this. I’m breaking and I’m not sure how to stop."
Anxiety,Best medication/medical treatment for GAD?,"

I’ve been on several different anti-depressants for my chronic anxiety and depression but feeling like it’s not doing any good at this point. 

I’ve been on Citalopram for maybe over a year now and I literally feel nothing, I don’t care about anything or get excited or motivated about anything. So I weaned off them, talked to my psychologist about living life without any meds for a while to see how clear I could get my head. 
It’s been nearly a month with nothing and I’m the most anxious I’ve been since first starting any medication/therapy four years ago. 

 I can’t do anything outside of my home without feeling flighty and like everyone is watching me, I keep stuffing things up because I’m afraid of doing the wrong thing then I do it anyway. My relationship is a complete and utter mess because  I’m so overwhelmed by this feeling of anxiety and doubt. 

I went to my dr about maybe getting some beta blockers or anti-anxiety meds. He told me to go back antidepressants. I felt more anxious and on the verge of an attack. I don’t want to feel nothing again. I don’t want to gain more weight. I don’t want to have to wean off another drug that gives me brain zaps and dizziness and nausea. 

I feel so hopeless, like I have nothing to live for. What’s the point if living this way? I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to have to keep take these drugs that turn me into an obese zombie."
Anxiety,Not sure what to do: just want someone to listen,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking this subreddit for a few months now, but this is the first time I've ever posted. Please let me know if there's something wrong within my post, thank you!

I'm a third year nursing student going on to my fourth year and for the past year, I've had this constant feeling of shortness of breath and palpitations. This was right in the middle of my clinicals in which nursing students go to local hospitals to basically shadow nurses and perform basic skills while monitored. At this time, the vaccine was not announced and I had relatives including my mom who were directly treating COVID patients. I was constantly under the fear of catching COVID from my shifts and passing it on to my family and I was socially isolated because I never went out unless completely necessary. I figured that these symptoms must have been related the stress of all this and that I would be better when I had my vaccine. 

Fast forward about six months later, and I was able to get both doses but my symptoms didn't stop. I started worrying that I had COVID myself, but I know I couldn't have as I had been properly following all guidelines. Other than the palpitations and the shortness of breath, I had no other symptoms like fever or sore throat. 

When I first had these symptoms, I first told my mom who is an ICU nurse. She told me that I was stressed and that it wouldn't last long, but now it's been months. I haven't told her that it's still going on because I've been told that I overreact how I feel. I've told her about my thoughts of possibly having some kind of anxiety disorder and seeking a diagnosis but both my parents agree that I shouldn't have anxiety because there's nothing to be stressed about and they're right. I have a home and I never have to pay rent, a loving family, a potentially stable career in the future, and friends whom I hold very close. This is also because my mom is caring for my grandpa who has cancer and I don't want to add to any stress she already has.

I don't know what to do. It's gotten to the point that I sometimes wake up and I feel like I'm suffocating. I can't fall asleep because the sound of my own heart beating keeps me up at night. I have crying fits about once a month for no real reason. And I don't want to say anything because everyone else has their own stuff to deal with.

I'm sorry if this post has been too wordy or difficult to understand. I actually made an appointment with my GP so that seems like a good first step. While I'm scared, I'm hopeful for the future and that I can finally put this behind me."
Anxiety,I am drowning in my thoughts,"The title says it all I feel like I'm drowning. I regret EVERY single life decision I've made in the past year and all the consequences and problems hit me right now. I have been living in survival mode for so long. Always overthinking, always having panic attacks. The worst part is that I am alone. I do have family and friends, I tried to explain them that I am serious when I say I am nt doing well. But mobody takes me seriously. I just want to know if it will get better. Is there a guarantee that this suffering will end some day?"
Anxiety,"Healthy anxiety kicking in, reassurance needed?","Yesterday i was bringing the washing in and something dropped to the floor, rather than picking it up slowly i threw my arm down to grab it like a jolt and in the process my forearm went really tingly. After that my arm felt heavy like someone is pressing down on it and feels a little shaky and in certain positions i get pins and needles. This was at 5 yesterday, i still feel the same now but maybe i just need to recover… i might have just shocked my arm into something it wasn’t expecting. I still have feeling in it but just feels weird compared to my other. My health anxiety isn’t helping things either haha."
Anxiety,How to survive a two week quarantine alone?,"I'm moving country in a few weeks and will need to do two weeks of isolation in an apartment by myself due to the pandemic and I'm freaking out.

I'm moving for work and when I took the job I was in a very good place mentally. The last two years have been the best of my life. I felt strong and confident, ready for anything.

Two weeks ago I had a relapse (I have OCD and intrusive thoughts) and I've been an anxious wreck since. I'm losing weight and wake up in a panic every morning. The rest of the day is then miserable.

I'm worried I'll get even worse being on my own and stuck inside for two weeks in a new country. 

I'm looking at going back to see a counsellor next week in person and then continue online.

The thought of moving and being alone in isolation is now incredibly daunting. But it's a good job and something that I really wanted to do until I had a relapse.

What would you do in my position?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get a shortness of breath and starts shaking?,"I’ve been studying for an exam since a week ago and it’s been getting in my head especially thinking on my plans for the future and adulting in general. This is my first time experiencing this symptom unlike before when I used to feel chest pains thats hurt whenever I would think of something worrying (almost anything, thoughts like “Did I forget my money” or “Crap I have to to go to the dentist this weekend”) especially if it’s something stressful that started since I was in 9th grade.

It just happened earlier when I was on my phone thinking about the possible outcomes of my exam (whether or not I should be studying instead of taking a quick break) and suddenly I start sweating and just start getting a shortness of breath. I got up from my bed and went to turn on my electric fan so I could breathe properly and sat down in-front if it. I start to notice that my hands were shaking and it made it harder for me to type on my phone when I was about to message a friend. It happened for a short while but I just want to know if anyone else experiences this."
Anxiety,Why does my anxiety get worse during night time?,"During the day I’m fine, no panic attacks, nothing too bad. But during the night I have to be careful to not spiral into a full on panic attack and get this horrible cold feeling in my forehead. It makes it hard for me to sleep and I’m not sure what to do."
Anxiety,"I got my GAD treated, but years later I feel like I have a different form of anxiety.","I used to have a lot of anxiety in social situations, I would feel very nervous walking past groups of people and fear them judging me. If I wanted to talk to someone new I wouldn't because of fear of being judged. I would over analyze a look that I got from someone, or their tome when they were speaking to me. I also had anxiety when doing other simple day to day things. For example I could be driving with someone in passenger seat, and overanalyze where I placed my hands on the steering wheel. My mind knew it didn't matter, but my body would react as if it were a life or death decision.

I got diagnosed and treated, which allowed me to feel comfortable around people, and gave me the ability to speak to anyone I wanted to without much fear. I no longer felt like simple day to day tasks were so serious, and overall I felt like my anxiety was fixed. But now a few years later, I feel a different type of anxiety. I find myself replaying social situations over and over in my head after the fact, and analyzing how others reacted to my presence. I'll replay something small like how a person I was speaking to looked away for a second after something I said, then come to the conclusion that they probably don't like me that much. Or I'll replay conversations I had in the past day, week or month, and wonder if I was being awkward, or if I said too much or revealed too much information. I know that its usually irrational, but I still feel the anxiety."
Anxiety,I’m overwhelmed by my own existence.,"As far back as I can remember I’ve always had issues such as existential anxiety and depersonalization. I found it more entertaining as a child, but as an adult it’s horrifying and right now it’s worse than ever. 

The fact that I exist terrifies me, it’s put a mental block on everything I used to enjoy. It makes everything feel utterly pointless and bizarre, but at the same time it doesn’t feel like depression does. It’s different than depression. It’s more a feeling of utter discomfort and confusion that I can’t quite understand. 

What I can say is that it’s the loneliest feeling I’ve ever experienced, and seeing other people walking around happy and content makes me worse because I’m like, am I missing something? We’re all here and existing without any sense or explanation and then we’ll all be gone and nobody seems to be bothered by this? It hangs over me like a dark and sinister dread and literally sucks the joy from everything, petrifying me!!!"
Anxiety,How can I get an SSRI?,"Hey guys, I have a problem. I have anxiety/depression and really want to try an SSRI.

Anxiety,How to deal with completely irrational/anxious thoughts at night?,"I have a lot of anxiety at night these days, due to thoughts that are totally irrational and wouldn't scare me so much during the day, such as:

\- Time is moving way too quickly, and I'm missing my life

\- I woke in a panic realizing I have a new health insurance policy and I am unfamiliar with the copays 

\- I remembered an email I got saying my google storage was about to be full. When I got the email I barely cared about it, but for some reason when I remembered this in the middle of the night I was panicking. I woke up thinking.... wtf?? WHY did this bother me at all!?

There's more but this is the gist. I get these thoughts that don't really affect me during the day, but at night I wake up panicking about them!

I've started to become aware of this in the night, that the thoughts I'm having aren't real. BUT the physical symptoms still linger: feeling I want to crawl out of my own skin, tossing and turning, cannot relax, etc. Deep breathing doesn't really help, as my mind goes straight back to the thoughts. 

I'm really struggling. If you guys have any behavioural changes, some concrete actions I can take in order to help please let me know !!"
Anxiety,Anxiety about being hungry,"So I’ve been having this issue where instead of eating because I’m hungry, I eat in anticipation of being hungry because I don’t want to get too hungry and overeat. It ultimately leads to me overeating and kind of defeats the whole purpose. I’m literally afraid to be hungry because I know I overeat when I am too hungry, but my fear is causing me to overeat 😭"
Anxiety,Any med students that can help me?,"So the reason I’m posting this on here is cuz people are more understanding and nicer than in other more general subs and this is more of an anxiety issue. 

My nose cartilage was injured and so it moved in slightly making there look like there’s a dent just before the tip of my nose. It’s small but it’s been bothering me. I’ve seen a doctor and only option I have are fillers but apparently they are risky. 

I was wondering, since nose cartilage can grow and change... is there any hope that my nose will smoothen out a bit or that some cartilage will move back or grow? A small change would make it look better.

But please!!! If you only have bad news I’d rather you don’t comment because my anxiety can’t handle it. 

If you have anything that could make me more hopeful please let me know. My doc did say there are people whose noses continue to settle a year later (it’s been 10 months for me) but didn’t specify why"
Anxiety,On my way to my first date in 4 years,"Really freaking out but proud of myself. I can do it, just god please help me so that i dont get panic attack."
Anxiety,Anxiety with starting a new full time job since 3 years ago.,"Hey guys, im afraid of starting work again for full time, i want to work but i wanna fight the fear of getting fired on the first day or quitting on the first day (cause thats what i did), i want to start my first year apprenticeship as a spray painter (painting cars fyi), ive learnt it at school and at home and know the basics, but i dont wanna stuff up when im in the workspace, i also wanna fight the fear of getting anxiety before getting ready to leave for work, ive had anxiety for 3 years and would love some help, and i also dont wanna take anti depresents cause they don't work. Many thanks ✌️"
Anxiety,Feeling super exhausted from anxiety/panic?,"This whole week I’ve been stressed out and get anxious. Have had a few anxiety attacks and one panic attack this week. All from me worrying constantly about health stuff even after so many doc visits and so many tests, all normal. I still worry. I also get anxious anytime I feel tired/sleepy idk why.

Anyways today I’ve been worrying about a on/off headache in the forehead area. I’ve also been feeling super tired like I could sleep all day kind of tired but can’t do that cause of anxiety. Could this be from panicking on/off all week? Like the exhaustion &amp; stuff

Does anyone else get like anxiety hangovers for a few days?"
Anxiety,Feeling anxious about new management promotion,"I’m really struggling with this. I’m a high performer at work (probably in part due to my anxious nature). My boss is being let go tomorrow and I’m being asked to step in and take his place. My coworkers love my boss, so I’m afraid they will all take this very hard and possibly quit. With this being my first management position, I feel really anxious about this whole situation. 1) I am being asked to take on a lot, immediately. 2) We will already be understaffed with me taking over my boss’s position, and if other people quit we will get even farther behind. 3) My anxiety is giving me imposter syndrome and I’m wondering if I made the right decision to take this. 

The other option was to hire someone from Indeed to be our new manager and I would have stayed in the same position. So either way, my boss is being let go.

Does anyone have any words of encouragement or advice?"
Anxiety,I can not believe how far I've come in a few short years!,"I moved to a new country with my boyfriend 10 months ago and we haven't been able to see either of our families because of covid and we are both close with our families.
I suffer from really bad anxiety and he has even done courses to understand it more so he can support me!

One of my biggest fears when moving was falling into a bad place again and not being able to get our of it, particularly because we moved during the pandemic, needed to find jobs and its our first home together! Naturally I thought of every single bad thing that could happen.

It hit me recently how far we've come together but particularly how far I've come! Moving country and taking away everything that was ""safe"" meant i could really understand myself and what effects my anxiety, if it's bad seeing how I can help myself and be nice to myself and not my own worse enemy! I'm also in the gym, and have a full time job where I can build an INSANELY good career and intend to be manager by christmas. 

I can actually see a future and let me just say it looks very amazing!

For reference, 4 years ago I physically could not go anywhere without someone with me and it has taking me what feels like a lifetime but I have got here and I'm so happy!"
Anxiety,Ako lang ba?,"Hindi ko na alam ano gagawin ko. Buhay ko ba talaga ito? Gusto ko ng sumuko. Pagod na ako.

Ginagawa ko nman ang lahat. Pero bakit parang kulang pa? Ang trabaho ko mas madami pa sa kanila. I also work twice as much as them. Pero kulang pa din. Hindi pa rin sapat lahat ng ginagawa ko.

Ang sakit sa dibdib isipin na kahit anong gawin ko, I will not be good enough for them. Lahat ng ginawa ko, hindi nila nakikita lahat ng efforts ko. 

Baka mas madali kung magpakamatay na lng? Kasi mas madaling umalis ng hindi nagpapaalam. Mas madaling umalis ng walang explanation. Kasi nga dba? Lahat ng galaw mo may explanation.

Bakit ka aalis? Sayang yang trabaho mo. Hindi basta basta ang makapasok dyan. Sayang ang opportunities. Hindi madali maghanap ng trabaho. Sayang ang pinag aralan mo. 

Sayang. Yan lng naman ang alam nila. All they see ay kung ano ang mawawala sa iyo. Hindi nila alam ano pinagdadaanan mo. Kasi kahit anong sabihin mo, ang makikita at makikita lng nila ay ang mga bagay na masasayang mo. "
Anxiety,"how to cure high level of anxiety, any advice?",
Anxiety,I might have hypothyroidism and I'm a hypochondriac....,"I recently got a battery of tests done and it turns out I have abnormally high TSH levels of about 7.84. Which indicate hypothyroidism. :/

I've been so anxious, I'm going to see a doc ASAP. My mom has thyroid problems as well. It's just so scary. I don't want to be infertile or put on lots of weight.

It makes me so sad. I cried the whole afternoon and I just want to die. I had a particularly bad day and I just do not want to be stuck with a disease my entire life. Especially one that might cause me to be infertile."
Anxiety,Man I’m dating complimented another girls eyes whilst I was there ?,"So don’t get me wrong this guy complemented my eyes a while ago whilst he was on magic mushrooms but I did ask him “ what do my eyes look like when you on magic mushrooms “ 
And he hyped me up 

Few weeks later I told him my eyes are an insecurity of mine so don’t compliment another girls infront of me cause it really hurts anyway next day he does magic mushrooms and without this girl asking he starts complimenting her eyes I distracted myself cause I knew what was happening and he comes up to me and says “ don’t be mad “ with a big grin on his face. 
I’ve not taken mushrooms so I don’t know what visuals it changes 
Cause they nothing special so must be once hell of a drug but it’s why did he choose her and not me, am I overthinking this I know I am but that’s what I do he tried to make it right by hyping me but only cause I asked for it like I want it to be natural if he’s going to do it not forced.
Please can someone help me change my perspective of this cause it’s really hurting and the anxiety is so intense"
Anxiety,Ended a good relationship,"I ended my relationship with my partner on Friday and I can’t stop thinking about him. 

I came to the decision after realizing that I wasn’t my best representative in my relationship. While no one is perfect and I’m trying to not idealize my partner, it really wasn’t anything they did that pushed me to ending the relationship. 

I just was overcome with guilt that I essentially let my anxiety become a 3rd person in our relationship and now that was affecting not only myself but him as well. I realized that I needed to take a long pause to really really work on learning to live with my mental health struggles and process past trauma that I just haven’t spent time to reflect on. 

I miss him so much, like it’s eating me alive. But I just knew he deserved better than what I could give him at this time. I’m just so hurt that I hurt someone I love so much and I’m not sure what to do. Part of me wants to beg him for other chance, another part of me thinks I was right in me decision to let him go. 

The good thing is, he understands and wishes me the best. Hell he even went ahead and said that he didn’t have anything bad to say about me and that he felt like this was a “see you later” and not a “goodbye”. 

But I feel like I lost “the one” for me and that sucks. I hate my anxiety. I hate it so much and I just wish I could rip it out myself."
Anxiety,"Does anyone have ""Imposter Syndrome""? And if so, how do you cope with it?",
Anxiety,Health anxiety + pfizer vaccine,"So, three days ago i got my first shot of the pfizer vaccine, i had a lot of anxiety at the thought of taking it since it's a new vaccine and i have health anxiety. I read about the vaccine before i went to take it and read that a (very small) number of males under 30 has gotten myocarditis after their shots.

Now i can't stop thinking that i will get it and die if i go and exercise. Before the shot i exercised between 5-7 days a week( i compete in thaiboxing). I could use some help getting over my fear, i know its a SUPER small amount of people getting these severe reactions but i just can't stop thinking that i will get it. I saw some recommendations to rest for a week after getting the pfizer vaccine in case you get myocarditis.. but i really want to keep exercising. This is also making me not want to take my second shot."
Anxiety,"After Three Months, I've finally been able to speak again. Now time to spend 3 more weeks learning how to deal with my social anxiety...",
Anxiety,"After Three Months, I've finally been able to speak again. Now to spend five more months dealing with social anxiety...",
Anxiety,My boyfriend is moving away and i don’t know what to do,"I’ve been living with my boyfriend at his parents house for over a year now and we are completely in love, this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. Unfortunately because of my own mental health and bad habits, I think I’ve become unhealthily attached. He is moving a few hours away for school and I will be staying here. The past few days when I’m alone i just start crying so much that I can’t even calm myself down, I started doing grounding techniques which will help in the moment and then I start spiraling again until i’m crying for what feels like forever. 

I haven’t talked to him specifically about this level of anxiety I’m having because I don’t want him to feel like he should stay home for me or feel held back at all. He does know that it sucks for both of us and he gives me the reassurance like we’ll visit all the time, we’re ganna be ok etc. 

Partially my anxiety is of the typical long distance anxiety, what could happen when we don’t see eachother all the time? 

The main part of my anxiety is that I literally go to work and just look forward to coming home to him everyday, I don’t really have any friends that live nearby and I don’t know the best ways to make friends as I’m mostly introverted until I’m already comfortable with someone. I can spend time with family but they just make me feel stressed as they always have some kind of drama. I could just work more but then I get in this spiral is that all life is, go to work and go home repeat? I just feel like I’m going to go into a depression when he leaves and I don’t want to do that but it’s already starting. I feel like I’m not going to have anything to look forward to everyday and that scares me. 

So any advice on what I can do to overcome this overwhelming anxiety 😩

My therapist was suggesting to find new hobbies but she just left her practice so I’m out of a therapist and I’m not really sure what hobbies I would enjoy"
Anxiety,Wish I hadn’t told my mom what happened,I was doing better on my own lol. Now she just triggers me every day by trying to dig if she thinks I’m remotely down or even apathetic. I try setting boundaries and she just doesn’t fucking get it
Anxiety,I can't think when I'm anxious,It's so bad. I have a hard time thinking when I'm nervous. I don't know what to do or how to fix this. My family has noticed it. Is this normal or can someone give me some advice?
Anxiety,I feel like Girlfriend will leave if I don't tell her every last issue I have.... #Anxiety issues #Dating,"So I have a few anxiety disorders.

Started dating great woman (so far lol) and I keep feeling the anxiety to tell her more and more of my negative traits and issues, she far she is understanding. But I keep coming up with new things to mention to her that are possibly ""issues"" I have lol...it's not ideal.

I need to focus on the positive and good things. But my anxiety mind is like ""make sure to tell her this also or it could come up someday and 5 years later she will leave you because you forgot to mention this"".......which I get is not realistic.

But like, do most people just keep things in and if issues arise later they arise etc and worked out then?

I used to not think of this stuff when dating but have anxiety disorders now (OCD, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder.. (yes they are treated and on meds and I have a therapist, and Girlfriend is aware of that)......

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah I need to figure out how to stop my mind from feeling anxiety if I don't say every last thing and ""get it all out on the table"" so to speak of all my dumb issues.....very annoying:) I'm sure for her and me.

Therapist says ""you don't need to tell her every last negative or issue you have"".......but my mind says ""if I don't then she will leave etc if she finds out I wasn't 100% honest about every last thing""......I love anxiety......:)"
Anxiety,Sweaty hands,"Whenever my anxiety kicks in my hands get super sweaty. It gets so bad I can’t even pick something up without it getting soaked or slipping out of my hand. I’ve tried washing my hands constantly, putting my hands in front of a fan or AC but it just keeps coming. The only thing that seems to help is high alcohol hand sanitizer which dries it out for a bit but even then it doesn’t last long so I keep putting on more and more and it makes my hands break out in a bad rash. Does anyone else have the same problem and can anyone recommend anything to help?"
Anxiety,Someone broke into my house and I'm freaking out.,I had someone break into my house this morning while me and my kids were sleeping. I woke up and he was sleeping on my sofa. It scared the shit out of me even though he was just drunk and didn't hurt us. The cops took him home and we didn't press charges.  When I remember It happening I freak out all over again. I have therapy and emotional regulation class tomorrow. How do I get through today? How do I sleep tonight? I'm already a super anxious and paranoid person to begin with now I feel like my fears have been validated
Anxiety,Are there ways to reduce the side effects of anti-depressants?,"I've been taking these antidepressants...

1. Venlafaxine for almost 1.5 years (Two 75mg pills(150mg total) every night)
2. Trazodone for 1 year (25 mg every night at the start, now 12.5 mg every night)
3. Lorazepam for 6 months (1 mg every night at the start, now 0.35-0.5 mg every night)
4. Fludiazepam for three weeks(0.125 mg to 0.25 mg every night)

* I've noticed that I have trouble recalling familiar things...  
Example : The name of my second drug (Trazodone) although I have been searching it on the web for information more than 10 times in the past year.  
(Are these signs of Alzheimer's?)
* My daily habit is very fragile, muscle memory is very hard to form.  
Sometimes I just suddenly forgot what I am doing, I either find a lead/hint for what I am doing earlier or I just lost it, completely.
* I can recall most of the old memories(before I started taking antidepressants) but now I have trouble recalling long-term memories after taking those.  
I'm also diagnosed with bipolar II three weeks ago, and I think I am having mixed episodes right now, sometimes I can recall everything I was doing for the day, sometimes I forget everything.  


Does meditation help, which kind of meditation should I try?  
I tried coffee while I am down but I think it enhances my anxiety(Nope, not taking coffee anymore)  
I am also very curious about how these antidepressants do with my brain, is there an interesting book where I can start off? (I'm a chemistry major, so studying these brain chemistry/biochemistry increase dopamine in my nerd brain, just kidding)"
Anxiety,I may need a new dentist,"I suffered from several undiagnosed mental illnesses for decades until being diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder w/ frequent panic attacks, persistent depressive disorder, OCD, ADHD, emetophobia, etc. I am now 45f. 

I basically spent close to 2 decades in a state of disassociation. I have lots of missing memories, my health is in the toilet, but for the purposes of this post, I let my dental health completely slide. 

Now that I’m getting proper treatment, I’m doing my best to take care of the physical issues. Now, when I was researching local dentists, my search parameters were hampered by my crap insurance, but I did my best to find one with positive reviews from patients. 

Unfortunately, I’m not sure if this dentist is the right fit for me. Upon my very first visit, and subsequent visits, I have been VERY clear that I have very bad anxiety in this environment in particular. Always have. 

During my last visit, my anxiety was pretty intense. Even though I had taken Xanax before my appointment, I still had a panic attack in the chair. I was very clear with the dentist as to what was happening. It was kind of obvious as I was visibly shaking. 

I was met with impatience, the dentist scolding me by saying that he “can’t work with a moving target”. 

It bears repeating here that I could not stop shaking. Because I was having a panic attack. He ended up leaving a small cavity only partially finished. 

I don’t think I can go back."
Anxiety,"I'm 30 male, my whole adult life I've had a strange mental block which held me, whenever i sit at the table in order to do productive things (not play games) my anxiety and panic slowly spikes up to the point i can't focus and think, so i have to abandon it."," 

What's frustrating is that I'm pretty capable, was always considered smart everywhere i worked, by friends etc, had good ideas that helped people, solved problems. I am sure I'm much more than who i am in life right now, but because of my problem whenever i sit to work on something that will bring me money or some other assets. And the older I'm getting the more it frustrates me that I'm capable but i just can't, i physically can't do it. It takes me tremendous amount of motivation or extreme pressure or outside danger (like going broke next month if I don't do it) to do anything. And if i try to do it without extreme circumstances it takes just few minutes to build up enough frustration to leave the task and go do easy things, games, youtube, food etc.

What's weird is that what I'm trying to work on is not an alien thing to me, i like it, i see how i can add value, make really useful things, for many people in fact. Sometimes I'm amazed how effective that mental block is, it's like my brain doesn't allow me to do things when I'm sitting at the table, but the moment i leave my table and lay down on my bed the block lifts and I'm actually able to do it without accumulating frustration. This very post i couldn't write when i was sitting, but look at that wall of text, because I'm on my bed.

I also had problems sitting at the table at school etc, always fidgeting and sleepy. But i wasn't considered a bad student, because i had enough brains to do what was required last minute. From what i can remember there was a traumatic episode when I changed school because my parents moved a lot. When i was brought to new school and sat at the table with new class and all strangers around me, i had a full blown panic attack and ran out and asked to never come back there. Would that really be the reason? I don't know what to do. I can't work from bed all the time, it gets uncomfortable after some time and you know beds weren't designed to be a workplace.

Sometimes it's getting ridiculous, every now and then i see opportunities to make tens or even hundreds of thousands dollars, but i can't, my brain literally blocks me from it almost as fast as i sit at the table.   


Forgot to add that i have a short window of clear thinking wihout anxiety when i wake up and if something breaks it - it stays for the rest of the day.  
It's hard to reset back, a nap or weed helps (tested recently).

Phew... what a vent..."
Anxiety,Shaking,So about 2 weeks ago my anxiety went thru the roof. I’ve dealt with anxiety since 13. Now 30. All because I took prednisone. I’ve never felt anxiety so bad. It’s calmed down a lot but I’m shaking when it’s time to go to bed and when I wake up. I can go all day fine with almost no anxiety but for some reason night time and waking up is so bad. Does anyone else deal with the shakes from anxiety?!? It makes me think there’s something else wrong with me even though I was just at the ER and everything came back fine.
Anxiety,I don’t like having friends.,"I like my friends - they care about me and have been there for me through my darkest times. What I don’t like is getting really anxious and feeling like they are going to be mad at me if I don’t want to go out and do anything. I feel like I have to come out with an excuse good enough for them to not get upset about me wanting to hang out with them. Why can’t it just be as simple as I’m tired or how about this, I don’t want to? I like staying at home. I like getting to bed at a decent time and waking up feeling refreshed. When we do hang out we talk about things that make me anxious anyways. I feel like since they know about my anxiety and depression they should understand this. I don’t get upset if people don’t want to hang out, I respect that. I always point this out to them and they say “We get upset because we like having you there”. Anyways - it’s mentally exhausting and I’m always, always worried about them being mad at me. I feel like it would just be easier to not have friends. Why does my brain cause everything to bother me so much? But hey, that’s anxiety for you. I know I’m probably not the only one that experiences this so any advice feel free to share!"
Anxiety,“And then meds and therapy made everything better”,"That’s great that it did for you. But hearing that is soul crushing for those of us who it hasn’t, and being told over and over we’re just not trying hard enough when we’re fighting every day.

That doesn’t mean we tried one therapist or one medication and gave up. But life is relentless for some, and fighting every day to get knocked out, well, it gets harder and harder to stand back up. That’s what happens in the boxing ring, and it’s applicable to fighting for our mental health too."
Anxiety,My medication stopped working :( I don’t want to go through this again.,Feeling this horrible gut pain and anxiety just wanting to vomit 24/7 😭 the bad thoughts race in my head. I don’t want to keep fighting this demon!
Anxiety,Do I have anxiety?,"Sometimes there’s littles stresses that lead to me getting lack of sleep, breathing deeply, and feel fearful such as school, work, or fear of anything new happening. However, there are moments where I randomly wake up, not knowing the cause, and my chest feels heavy, it feels like a rush through my body, and I still feel panicky and difficulty breathing. I don’t want to seem like I’m over thinking, but my body just never seems to be relaxed and at ease and I always feel like I’m living in this world of fear. What is y’all’s opinion? 😬❤️"
Anxiety,Is there a medication you can take when you’re about to have a panic attack/while you’re having a panic attack to calm you down?,"I have panic attacks a lot especially at school (daily occurrence sometimes multiple times a day) and I don’t really have a way to calm down. When I’m panicking I have tunnel vision, I’m lightheaded, shaking uncontrollably, hyperventilating/choking and sometimes I faint from it. Is there a medication that can help calm you down before/when having a panic attack?"
Anxiety,Health anxiety,"I’ve recently been diagnosed with Epididymitis and have been put on anti-biotics for it. You can look up what Epididymitis is but long story short it can be a very worrisome matter for younger males like me. 

I can’t stop worrying about it. I worry that the anti-biotics won’t work or the doctor didn’t diagnose me properly. Anti-biotics are supposed to start making you feel better within 72 hours and I can’t tell if it’s just in my head or not but I still feel the Epididymitis. I worry that I’ll be like this forever and my nuts will never feel the same as before. I’m supposed to go to a friends cottage and I worry that I won’t be able to have a good time because my nuts will be bothering me the whole time. I worry that my condition will get worse and I’ll wake up with severe pain. All these things I worry about are making I extremely difficult to go about my daily activities.

I keep telling myself that I feel better now than I did this time yesterday but I’m worrying so much I can’t tell if that’s true or not. I want to go to the ER but I know the state I’m currently in isn’t worth it. Every little sensation or movement I feel in my pelvic region makes me panic.

I just want to know if anyone else suffers/has suffered with a similar situation and can share how they cope."
Anxiety,Mental health doesn't have to kill you but can still take your life away,
Anxiety,Beyond anxious and scared,I try to sleep but I keep feeling the need to take the deppest breath I can and it keeps happening. Im so scared and panicking right now. Is this it me?
Anxiety,Getting an SSRI without insurance?,"Hey guys, I have a problem. I have anxiety/depression and really want to try an SSRI. I was going to try Hims but I leave for an apprenticeship school this week and can't wait for something to be shipped to me. Are there any relatively inexpensive telehealth services that I can get a script sent to a local pharmacy?"
Anxiety,"I've been having anxiety about intrusive thoughts of hurting people I love, I hate these thoughts and they won't go away. Has anyone else experienced this?",
Anxiety,never good enough,"i always try and be understanding, patient and put myself in their shoes but i’m never good enough, for anyone 

i’m tired, i’m so tired"
Anxiety,Feeling really exhausted. So anxious,"Yesterday I started feeling fatigue, like super tired, drained, no energy. Like I could sleep and sleep. Anytime I feel this way I get anxious, idk why. I have health anxiety too. 

I have had a very long week, having anxiety attacks like left and right over my worries about health, and even after going to docs a lot and tests run etc all normal, I still worry. 

I don’t wanna get up from my couch today cause I am so tired. When I get up I feel like I have no energy and feel just like crap. Of course all kinds of worries about health are running through my head now. And I’m trying to keep calm. 

I just feel very fatigued and don’t wanna get up at all today. Everything is just making me anxious yet again. 

Anyone else feel intense fatigue/drained some days??"

Anxiety,Feeling unsafe to be who I am,I just realized that a big trigger of my dissociation is the fact that I feel unsafe being who I am and having people see that person. I feel like it's going to get me in trouble for some reason. Does anyone have any tips on how to move through this? I want to feel safe in who I am.
Anxiety,Lowering Zoloft dosage with doctor supervision - feeling horrible,"I have been taking Zoloft since the end of 2008 for generalized anxiety disorder, ocd and ptsd. It was the 3rd antidepressant I tried before someone actually worked and didn't give me horrific side effects. I started on a very low dose (25mg) and was brought up to 200mg over a year. I felt the same on 200mg as I did on 100mg so I went back to 100mg. I only went to 200mg at that time because of my specialist saying I should. 

I was on 100mg for many, many years and though I could start to come down as I was in a good place. With doctor supervision I went to 75mg for 5 days. It was horrible. I went back to 100mg and thought I'd try again another time. Later when I tried to go down to 75mg, I felt horrible and returned to 100mg. but that changed a few years ago when my anxiety got worse again. I was put on 200mg. I started feeling better and have been on 200mg since then. About 1.5 weeks ago I started to lower my dosage to 150mg daily, with the supervision of my doctor and a pharmacist. I was feeling like I could try. Right now I am going through a lot of changes. My husband and I both are starting new jobs, I have a family health scare in my family, my best friend has major life changes in their life, and it's a lot to handle. I am feel awful. My mood is all over the place. I'm super manic (hyper, talking super fast and overly excited and loud. I'm loud and excited normally, but this is off the charts), I am angry for no reason, depressed for no reason, having night sweats, I hate this. Why is a 50mg change affecting me this much when I use to be ok at 100mg before? I am trying to push through because side effects are expected, but this is hell. I think I should go back to 200mg but now I'm thinking I will always be on these meds."
Anxiety,Anyone with anxiety experience internal tremors in hand and feet along with dizziness,"Anyone with anxiety experience internal tremors, eye also feeling like it's darting feel off balanced and like if I will faint and pass out. I had kinds of test including a brain CT scan 5 months ago asked my doctor if I need another he's like no you don't. I also feel like I am dropping towards one side.

Anxiety,Pretty bad case of weather anxiety,"Rarely post anything on here but I'm on my wits end.
 I've been having pretty bad weather anxiety for the past couple of months, I wasn't really that afraid of storms/thunderstorms when I was younger but last year things just took a turn after I was in a pretty bad storm. Nowadays I couldn't even feel a tad bit of wind without thinking that a storm gonna start, if I hear a creaking coming from the house I'll start getting paranoid or everytime it rains I wouldn't be able to look out the window without feeling like I'm going to shit out my heart and it use to be worse than this.
I used to frequently check the weather report every minute but I stop doing it because it was making me feel worse, I even used to not come out of the house if I saw the wind blowing and I'm sick of it, all I want is to be able to stay calm during a storm and not freak out for once, especially with the monsoon season approaching here in Asia I'm really in need for some advice."

Anxiety,I am constantly worried and paranoid the worst things will happen to me,"I’ve had anxiety since I was a very young kid, I would cry every day in my grandmas car until the bell rung and I had to go in. Anyways, it’s been up and down but lately is been really bad. Uncontrollable, out of nowhere. 

I’m bipolar and have depression as well and am having some physical health issues. My physical health is what really is causing my stress and I know this, but my appointments are still a few months out. I feel stuck. Every pain, ache, etc I get I feel like I’m dying. I feel a sense of doom and feel like I’m going to pass out a lot. I have to take valium because of it.

I have to get labs done a lot too and that triggers me really bad. I have to take 15mg of valium and lay down or I will pass out. Last time I got labs I was hyperventilating silently so much my nails turned blue. It was scary.

I am only 18 and I feel very bad. I’ve dealt with this most my life and I’m only 18. Sometimes I don’t know if I can deal with many more years of this. I feel really bad for my mom cause I n ow she worries about me a lot. I tend to downplay my anxiety and panic attacks a lot cause I don’t want her to worry. 

I just wanted to vent cause it’s been really exhausting. Thanks."
Anxiety,Trouble trying to relax,Does anyone feel short of breath and chest pains when you try to lay down? I’ve been experiencing them every time I try to sleep or even when I’m laying down trying to watch a movie and relax. I don’t know what to do because I want to be able to relax.
Anxiety,I got a call from Walmart wanting to schedule an interview but I am too afraid to call back.,"Last week, I quit my job after one day. It was too physically and mentally draining. After I quit, I applied to several other places near me. Including Walmart. Yesterday, I received a call from Walmart. I let it go to voicemail because I didn't recognize the number. They left a message wanting to schedule an interview with me. I know Walmart is just as stressful as the other job, if not more. I do not want a repeat of that. I am also afraid to call back because they might ask why it took me a day to call back and I don't know what to tell them."
Anxiety,Applied for my first job! :D,"I turn 22 next week and I've never had a job before, my anxiety has always been so severe that I was never able (or pushed) to leave the house. But I've had a lot of motivation recently and I was finally able to find a good place that was in need of workers so I applied online last night :) I've never done anything like this before and I'm so so proud of myself!! I really hope I get it, because the people there seemed super nice and it seemed like it would be easy on my anxiety there. Fingers crossed!"
Anxiety,I hate this.,Hey guys. First time posting in here but I hope it will help me. I’ve had anxiety ever since the 3rd grade as I can remember. I have always been the type to not be able to eat when I was anxious. Everyone thought it was weird which only made it worse because I now I’m caring what people think about me. Fast forward and I’m now with my wife of 5 years. I’ll have random episodes when I choke up and feel like gagging when I eat but I have NOTHING to be anxious about. I honestly only feel this way when we are going out to eat with her family. Or with some of my family that I don’t see often. But I love her family. We have lived together and always been around each other since we started dating . So why I’m the hell do I still get anxiety when they call us and ask us to dinner or to come over? Sometimes I can do it with no problems. But other times I feel like I’m going to throw up. Even when I know I’m hungry. It sucks so bad. I know that sometimes I can do it with no problems but the fact that I still have to think about and not just do it really irks me. I just want to be normal. Go out to dinners/party’s and just eat a bunch of food and have fun with everyone. I should note that when we are home by ourselves I eat like a pig. But a soon as we go out … it all goes away and everyone just thinks I never eat. Does anyone else have this?

Anxiety,Experienced my second anxiety attack,"My first attack was two weeks ago and I experienced my second one last night towards the end of my shift at my job. Luckily, it was near closing time so I was alone and not busy. I called my friend to come and pick me up and just sit through me while I managed to work it out. I don’t know what to do and I’m so fucking terrified. This has never happened to me before and I simply don’t know what to do. The first thing I recognized this time around was how heavy and numb my hands felt. Once my friend came to be with me I felt the attack reach it’s peak but I genuinely thought  I was going to faint. My partner ended up spending the night to be with me but this morning I still felt the heaviness I did on my hands and I started feeling my anxiety rile up because in my mind I was thinking “It’s coming I’m getting another one I’m having another attack.” Im angry at myself for feeling so out of control and Im also sad that this is happening to me. I feel like a hindrance to my partner for having to go through this despite them reassuring me. I’m just venting really but I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what to do, what to look out for or anything really. I’m feeling lost and very overwhelmed. Thanks in advance."
Anxiety,Terrible anxiety without my dog,"My dog helps a ton with my anxiety. I can feel a difference when he's around vs when he's not. We are currently separated due to vacation and I know he is being very well taken care of and is safe, honestly probably having the time of his life! But I cannot calm my anxiety down. I've been feeling so anxious all day. I can't even eat because I am so anxious. I'm just sitting here shaking with my heart racing. I know if my dog was here it would be so much easier and I would be feeling so much better but I couldn't bring him on vacation and now I have to figure out how to get through this without him. It's going to be so hard.  Does anyone else have a pet that helps them ease their anxiety? How do you deal when you're separated from them?"
Anxiety,Anxiety and stomach issues,"Hey everyone

So I've been really anxious this past week and not sure what I can do. I feel like I'm munching down antacids daily to get my indigestion and stomach issues under control. 

It's an odd feeling and not normal heart burn I don't think cause we'll it doesn't hurt and it doesn't burn. The best way I can explain it is if you exhale completely and that tinge you get in your lungs is kind how it feels just not as intense but does feel upper stomach lung area. Anyone else get this? 

I take pantoprazole which is a medicine to help with stomach issues but not even sure if a) its working or b) it's making things worse. ( I read too low stomach acid and too much have similar symptoms)"
Anxiety,Anxiety and stomach issues after getting corticosteroid hip injection,"Hey everyone

So I've been really anxious this past 2 weeks since I got my hip shot  and not sure what I can do. I feel like I'm munching down antacids daily to get my indigestion and stomach issues under control. 

It's an odd feeling and not normal heart burn I don't think cause we'll it doesn't hurt and it doesn't burn. The best way I can explain it is if you exhale completely and that tinge you get in your lungs is kind how it feels just not as intense but does feel upper stomach lung area. Anyone else get this? 

I take pantoprazole which is a medicine to help with stomach issues but not even sure if a) its working or b) it's making things worse. ( I read too low stomach acid and too much have similar symptoms)

But I guess it's a two part question

Any ideas to help with this stomach feeling?
And anyone else have a similar experience with a steroid shot? If so , how long did it cause issues?"

Anxiety,Heavy head/dizziness/headaches,"So for the past month ive been extremely anxious due to a sudden dizziness attack that it was, as we found out, probably due to my anemia. Since then i feel like i haven't been able to fully relax and i constantly think about it, my symptoms vary and sometimes reoccur. Since it's summer right now I want to be able to relax and have a fun time with my friends but i can't because I'm usually afraid that my ""unexplained"" dizziness/pressure in head will make me faint or lose balance. Ive also noticed that my eyes are out of focus when my symptoms are severe. One positive thing is that when my friends came over to visit, by going out and being occupied I felt much better, almost cured. Now that they left this weird feeling is back again and it's honestly destroyed most of my days. I feel like I have certain limits now. It's also been hard to fall asleep, i had insomnia for a few days but now I'm thankfully able to sleep some hours at night, while waking up sometimes etc. I'm not as carefree as I used to, and I want my deep -no worries-sleep back. Oh i also loved naps and now i just cant relax to do so. And my screentime tired me a lot for some reason...Im currently doing mindfulness and I've calmed down a lot compared to crying everyday about a month ago. But a feeling of uncertainty is still there. I feel like this is purely anxiety at this point and I'm truly trying to relax, but seeing my slow improvement makes me more impatient because I want to get back on track asap. Any advice?"

Anxiety,Going off medication,"Hello!

How do you know when you need Rob change dosage or get off your anxiety medication?

I’ve been on Paxil since November 2020 and it’s been great, but lately I have been having panic attacks and increased anxiety. 

I don’t know if the dosage needs to be upped or maybe it’s having the opposite effect. I don’t feel anxious about things since I’m home for the summer. 

I will make an appointment to meet with my doctor this week, but I wanted some input from you guys. 

Thank you!"
Anxiety,Feeling like I'm gonna stop breathing,"I'm not having a panic attack, but I feel like I could stop breathing soon.

I feel like this when I go to sleep, when I wake up, when I'm weak and right now. I feel like I'm gonna stop breathing automatically and never breathe again."
Anxiety,All my coping mechanisms keep ending up getting monetized,"I'm a musician and earlier this year I went through a terrible breakup.   
To deal with it, I started livestreaming my shoegaze music sometimes while I was at home, I would get high and kinda just forget the camera was there and I thought I was just staying connected with my friends and showing them a thing I could still do despite the pain I was in, because I wanted to feel like I still had a purpose.   
A few people watched my streams and started inviting me to gigs, and it was fun at first, I even set up a few more myself, but I'm under a lot of stress financially and dealing with some family issues that make it hard to stay living in the same area for much longer, I'm thinking about moving 300 miles back to my hometown to be with my dad, and deal with some things that happened when I was a teenager but I have all these local shows lined up and I bombed my set yesterday because I just couldn't get in the right headspace.   
Crowds freak me out, being on stage makes me really uncomfortable. I've been performing live for years but here lately I just don't feel like I enjoy it anymore.   
I still like to play music, but I feel like playing shows is such a more socially involved thing. I feel like I can't get out though.

TLDR I want to stop doing live performances because the social anxiety is getting to be too much for me, but I don't know how to set boundaries to clear my schedule once and for all without ruining my reputation or disappointing people. I have no interest in toughing it out anymore.   
What if I get out of this slump next year and can't get any gigs booked because I canceled them?   
I can't see myself doing that right now but I don't know what's going to happen."
Anxiety,"Shared nudes with a semi-stranger on discord, extremely paranoid/anxious about it.","Hello, everyone. Made a throwaway account for this, as you can see by my username. The discord account that I used was also an alt.

Welp, basically, a year or so ago I met a rather cool guy, we chatted a bit, mainly sexually. He sent me nudes, I sent him a nude a few months back. I don't remember exactly what I told him, but I think I might've told him my real name and the my country. When I asked him if he remembered he said both to no, though, I'm not sure if he's lying or not. We've been friends for, as I said, around a year. He has some mental troubles, so I don't think it's some sort of liar- who'd make up having mental issues for sexual gratification?

I've told him that I'm going to be taking a break from my account for the anxiety reasons. He didn't try to blackmail and anything, rather, just gave an ""Okay, I'll see you."" and that was that. I'm now deleting the account. I'm not sure if it's done though, what if he decides to track me down in the future somehow? What if he shares my nude with other people? I've been paranoid and anxious about this for months now, and I've, ironically, decided to turn to strangers for comfort."

Anxiety,Buspar for panic disorder,"Hi everyone, I was prescribed Buspar last year and started on Dec 2. I had tried Zoloft years earlier but had a terrible reaction so my new psychiatrist want me to try something different. Honestly after taking my first dose of Buspar I felt really mellow and thought it would help me. Around the 6 week mark I began to feel really depressed. I had negative thoughts about myself, life, and honestly struggled to get out of bed. I upped from 2.5 mg to 5mg and that stopped. However, I was getting brain zaps (which I didn't understand what they were at the time) and it scared me to go back down to 2.5mg. Again, I was fine for awhile before the negativity started happening. I went back to 5mg and stuck with a consistent schedule of taking it at the same time everyday and eating a big breakfast, which really helped. Once again I had to go back down because I thought my prescription would run out. Currently I am on 5mg once in the morning and have been since late June. The last few days have been awful, I feel suuper angry at the world, dizzy, emotional, and anxious. Is this normal? Will I have to up my dose again? I'm thinking of 3.5mg in the morning and afternoon. I also have PPPD if anyone even has a clue what that is."
Anxiety,I feel like no one actually likes me,"For years and years, ever since high school, I've had strong feelings that no one really likes me, or wants to talk to or be around me. And I can't stop thinking if I did something wrong. Like, did I say something the wrong way? Was it something I did? Am I just naturally unlikeable? What helps these thoughts is if someone I talk to regularly never messages me first. There have been many times where I stopped talking to someone because I decided not to message one day, and they never message me, which turns into weeks, then months of not messaging. It makes me believe that maybe I'm meant to be alone"

Anxiety,Anxiety is making dating literal terror for me,"Hello,

I would like to know if anyone ever achieved a healthy dating life after being miserable at it so I can have a sliver of hope.

I am a male in my late twenties, and to keep it simple, dating for me equals to constant anxiety attacks, and it just getting worse.

Previously when I dated a girl, I would sometimes loose focus or would be unable to continue a conversation.

Now, it is even worse as I am unable to be human, for example the last time I was dating a girl for a few weeks I:

* was unable to sleep normally
* had constant heart palpitations throughout the day
* had diarrhea all day
* had brain fog
* had small panic attacks (not the ""I am gonna die"", but ""how do I stop existing I hate whatever I am feeling right now, maybe if I watch a youtube video this feeling gonna go away"" type)


Of course I have all the check boxes you could have, I have zero self-confidence, I truly hate myself, and I am feeling absolutely hopeless, even so far that I don't think I am curable. I was somewhat suicidal in the past but I managed to change that with 5 years of therapy. However, this whole dating thing feels immutable. It is even more infuriating, as in normal relationships (friendships for example) are completely normal for me.

The worst thing is the last girl I dated knew about my mental deficiency, and was fully supporting me, but I just couldn't get over it, and we stopped dating. I feel absolutely broken and unfixable.

Let me know if you have some positive stories, suggestions, because I am feeling extremely down nowadays. I am planning to go back to therapy, but of course my anxiety is holding me back on that too.

(side note, this was posted on another subreddit, but for that subreddit the auto mod went hayware, and banned 80% of the comments, except a single persons who called me an asshole lol)

Kind regards,

Anxiety,Withdrawal from beta blockers (Bisopronol) help?,"Hello, I began taking 7.5mg of beta blockers in Jan this year due do sinus tachycardia. Before the medication my resting heart was 101 and 130 whilst doing stuff in the house. 

Since taking the beta blockers my heart rate has reduced but at the age of 26 I do not want to rely on this medication or be on it for the rest of my life. 

I started working out in February and I've been doing loads of cardio. 

Today is my first day without the beta blocker and my heart is going absolutely mental... I have been weaning off over a few weeks. 

I woke up and my heart was pounding from the second I opened my eyes. Did anyone experience withdrawals? I'm just scared all that cardio I've done hasn't done anything to reduce my heart rate and it was all the medication. 

How long do the withdrawals last?"
Anxiety,Why do i feel like something's wrong or forgetting something important when i am not being anxious?,
Anxiety,ive been feeling stressed lately,"ive been stressing about a few things the past week. first is school and work life. i just had a job interview on monday and ive been really anxious about whether im gonna get the job or not since i really want to work where i applied. i also last minute applied to
college, and i wasnt planning on it being so sudden until i realized that there was really no time to apply so now i feel very rushed about it. that and balancing those two out. i need to get a job and i have to go to school now and im stressed about balancing both of those. the other thing stressing me out is that its about to be a whole year since a traumatic even happened, and i just keep putting a bunch of importance over it. my sleep schedule was also really bad the other week. it got to the point where i was up for 24 hours trying to fix it. because of that, i ended up feeling really nauseous, tired and anxious. the past few days ive fixed it though. right now though, i just feel weird and anxious. i dont feel like myself, and i feel like i cant think very clearly. i feel a little frustrated and sad but its hard to let the emotions out. i had a bad dream last night and it kinda scared me. i just dont want to experience this anymore. i was doing amazing the other week and now i feel the opposite. i think maybe my lack of sleep last week just threw me off completely. i was working out and eating consistently and now i lost motivation :/"

Obviously the symptoms of anxiety are the same as a lot of these, and atm I’m struggling with shortness of breath, feeling ‘spacey’ and lightheaded, and have done for the past couple of days.

I’m an otherwise fit and healthy 22 year old who exercises regularly, eats well and doesn’t smoke. Please, I just need the reassurance that this is all anxiety and it’ll start to ease as I calm down and distract myself and cope with it"

Anxiety,Anxious out of nowhere,"Hello Everyone.

So, in February of this year I relapsed into my anxiety (some anxiety ""spikes"", panic attacks, nausea, no appetite etc). This was probably due to COVID lockdown, some insatisfaction with my work and some general feeling of insatisfaction with my life.

After a few rough months I started medication on May, had two weeks of even worst anxiety due to the medication (escitalopram). After that I had a very good 3 weeks, with some anxiety but very manageable or no anxiety at all to the point that I remember thinking ""I almost forgot what its like to be in a panic"".

Until yesterday, for some reason and out of nowhere I had a bad anxiety episode, where I almost freaked out, that lasted a few hours. 

Today, I wake up fine but after a couple of hours I started to feel anxious again...

Does this happens to you guys? I still have stuf that I have to fix in my life, I am aware of that. I already made some changes ( swiming classes, and I started to drive at the age of 36!!) and If I'm being honest I fell in to some old bad habits too (ie too much time on distractions: youtube, games, movies), but I am allowed to do that right?

Overall I'm good, just venting because this situation is a bit frustating... 

We are in this together, let's keep doing our best!"
Anxiety,At what point do you get help?,"After a few months of particularly bad anxiety and stress issues and spending the past week crying every day, I decided to tell my mum what's been going on and how I've been feeling.

She then suggested I go see a therapist. Now I am not opposed to this, however I just get the feeling that my problems are too trivial for a therapist and that I would be wasting their time.

Is this just classic overthinking on my part?"
Anxiety,Hey I wanna ask if this happens to y’all,"I was chilling and randomly got really nauseous with a headache. I texted my friends and one said to drink water and it helped immensely. I’m well hydrated and live off tea that I make so there’s no sodium unless it’s in the leaves but for most I doubt it since even some of the leaves are made by my family so we can brew them. I didn’t actually vomit but I have before. Now I just have a headache and an a tiny bit nauseous but will get some more water. Could this be tied to my anxiety? I have a lot of doctors appointments this month from getting an MRI to getting reevaluated for autism, so I’ve been more stressed than usual but it’s not as bad as it normally is when I get this nauseous though it is the same feeling I get when I have a breakdown. Sorry if that was ramble-y, I was panicked when I started writing and one called down a bit t would still like to hear what y’all have to say (also it’s been about half a year since my anxiety was bad enough to have me wake up and vomit immediately, so it’s been a while.)"

Anxiety,I’m kind of lost and need some insight or advice,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety my whole life and have finally mustered up the mental energy to get help but things had a turn for the worst.
My SO is a person that doesn’t understand mental health and the kind to be dismissive about it even though l I try my best to explain it. 
However recently my SO has fallen into depression because of the passing of their mother and refuses to accept or get any help and it has been weighing on me slowly. The relationship has been slowly falling apart but both of us still refuses to let go. 

I am almost at my wits end so I proposed a two weeks break and my SO has become even more suicidal because of that. 

I still want to care for my SO but I don’t feel like I have the means to do so anymore. My feelings for my SO are also slowly fading because of that and i am really scared propose a break up.

I haven’t been eating well( just one meal a day) or sleeping well for the past week either. 

Can someone tell me what to do?"

So I’m really struggling at the moment with anxieties around my health. Any little pain is causing me severe anxiety.

I have the absolute fear of death. I’m just always on edge. I’m too scared to medication to put my mind at ease because I’m too concerned with the side effects. I start therapy on Monday after three years of being on waiting lists.

The presentation is meant to 5 minutes and so is the question session. I’m not too worried about the presentation since I’ve rehearsed it well and timed myself but I’m absolutely terrified of the
Anxiety,Argh the usual terrifying start to the day gosh I don’t know how much longer o can do this,I can’t beat it or bare it anymore sick of waking up feeling awful and wanting the day to be over before it’s even started.
Anxiety,How to do my medical check ups when I suffer from health anxiety,"As the title say I suffer from health anxiety and has been a while.
It wasn't 100% diagnosed, or at least my therapist didn't give me a full straight forward diagnose (she just calls it anxiety) but I am 100% sure it's related to personal health only, because my incidents and extreme panic moments happens in relation to this.
So, here is the problem I want advice on.
My body needs extremely care right now, I am 21 and I am behind of general check ups and have some stuff I should definitely check up, like for example my wisdom tooth that for one year has been giving me periodically pain.
I know I have to do the visits to the doctors, that my last blood test was at 12,  that I should visit a specialist for my Raynaud phemonenon (just to ask tips and do an official check up everything is Allright), that I should check my wisdom tooth and I burnt myself with the laptop and that should need some checking too.
My health was very good when my anxiety started but now with me neglecting this stuff I risk of making stuff go where they shouldn't.
Everytime I talk about it or think about it I get extremely anxious and my biggest fear is to go there in front of the doctor, have a panic attack and faint in front of them, like it happened to me indirectly again.
Everytime I feel pain my anxiety makes it bigger and sometimes make me go into a full circle panic  so close to make me faint.
Or sometimes I talk about what could something be with someone and start feeling pain that ""doesn't exist"".
Talked about the burn with a friend and suddenly my whole arm nerves hurted from start to finish, causing moving it really painful, but I knew it was all in my head.
I also want to get a vaccine shot to feel safer cuz everytime I come from outside (and I already go out rarely) I'm super paranoid and have breath and chest pains.
But I fear that after I get the shot I will experience intense anxiety and wouldn't tell what is caused by the vaccine and what is caused by anxiety.

In short, this anxiety right now could potentially ruin my future life, because it's that time in my life where I should do my check ups.
I already go to a therapist but she is using the talk it out way so I'm not under anything.
She told me to be patient because it takes time to go away which I understand but the question is...

How do I do all these stuff without the anxiety obstacling me?
Is it even possible? I will probably end up feeling sick anyway right?
So how can I make it the less possible painful?
What do you do when you're like me and have to do doctor visits.
I must point that even just passively hearing about anything medical related causes me attacks.
Or even just reading news about vaccines and stuff.
Everything medical makes me go into the full loop of ""throat blocked, can't breath""  (yea first covid period was everyday panic attacks for me, till I decided to not follow any news anymore, so I am out of the loop but a bit safer).

Please give me your advices about it, because I seriously need to address these stuff as soon as I can, I wouldn't want to cause permanent damage..

But I also feel not strong enough to undergo medical procedures or like dealing with my wisdom tooth (that pretty much will have to get removed and is still under skin).

I don't know what to do, how to gather strenght.

Thanks for reading."
Anxiety,Best books that help with anxiety," I’ve been reading a bit more these days (mostly for fun) and I was thinking that maybe I could start reading a book that could help with my anxiety. I mostly get anxiety about things I have to do like assignments, studying, taxes, etc if that helps. Any solid recommendations would be greatly appreciated!"
Anxiety,Learning to drive and I crashed our car,"I was feeling confident the other day so I volunteered to put the car in our garage. I ended up hitting the gate with the side of the car and I'm pretty sure I froze for like 5 seconds before I hit the brake. It's a pretty bad dent and I ended up crying all night over it.

Now I've been spiraling into madness blaming myself because it was such an avoidable thing. I've been feeling anxious about it and wondering if I'm ever gonna learn to drive because I really fear getting into much serious accidents and hitting an living person. Now every time I think about driving I think about losing control like I did the other day and not being able to respond as quickly as I should have."
Anxiety,Hydroxyzine making me feel high,"Hey all, a little background. I’ve been dealing with horrid anxiety for a while now and finally decided to ask to be medicated with my doctor. I just finished a month of 5mg lexapro and haven’t really felt a difference so I talked to my doctor again and got 10mg lexapro and hydroxyzine to help with panic/ anxiety attacks. Last night I felt really unwell before dinner so during dinner I took 1 pill. I don’t remember the mg but I was instructed to take 1/2 to 3 pills ever 4 hours as needed. I’m small and decided I probably only needed one. 

About 30ish minutes later I took my daily lexapro as well. 

Within an hour I felt crazy weird. I’ve smoked pot before but not recently and I felt like I had just smoked a bowl. I felt good for about an hour or so then started to feel really panicked. Like a high gone bad. I just laid in bed trying to distract myself and eventually was able to fall asleep. 

About 4 hours later now (4 am) I am awake as can be and cannot fall back asleep for the life of me. I woke up feeling very panicked and again was able to use my phone to distract myself and feel a little better. 

Has anyone had this experience on hydroxyzine? I’m going to contact my doctor today to inform her of this of course but I was wondering if I’m alone in this feeling or not. My side effects definitely do not line up with what I’m reading online."
Anxiety,Anyone else have this problem?,Every night I wake up around 5 o’clock (don’t start work till 8) with the worst sickness and anxiety and I vomit pretty much every morning before I go to work.

Anxiety,In anticipation of someone saying your name when listening to music,When I listen to music with my headphones I always feel like one of my family is calling for me even when no one is. Namely my Mom. She has always shouted for me or my siblings names. Its been hard to listen to music ever since my anxiety got worse. I always anticipate someone calling me or think I hear conversations between my family from my room upstairs then I have to pause to see if someone is. Half the time no one does. I have ADD and listening to music when i study really helps me focus but this added anxiety makes it hard to focus in addition to my already distraction prone ears. I have big family and its always been lively around the house. But this is the first it really bothered me. Can anyone here relate?

Anxiety,Anxious after touching myself,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I (20F) just always get really anxious after masturbating, and it’s the same whether I orgasm or not. If it’s relevant I have endometriosis and other medical issues but I’m not getting pain and I don’t usually get anxious with pain and it’s just so confusing and generally it’s making my anxiety more frequent (even if I don’t masturbate it’s happening more often after I do once).

Anxiety,Multiple visit to doctors,"Hi I am new in this subreddit. I have quite a severe health anxiety and already diagnosed with MDD and GAD early this year.

I have shortness of breath for two weeks already, and two doctor visit at that.  I feel like I am short of breath but my oxygen rate is okay, no coughing, no wheezing. Is it anxiety attack? How long does anxiety attack can be?

At first I was diagnosed with GERD and after second visit today, she prescribed me with Xanax. Is it gonna help with my shortness of breath?"
Anxiety,110kg / 15 years no exercise / getting really dizzy .. normal? Anxiety / DP.," Hey Guys,

Im 26, 181cm tall and weight around 110kg.

I did no sports since 10-15 years.

I  slowly start to exercise again, but even after short running I get  dizzy or vertigo like symptoms. It feels a lot like dissociation. My  puls is pretty normal during those sessions. I drink and eat enough  before.

I strongly think its linked to my anxiety..

Is this common for people that didn’t do any fitness since years ?

I will go to the docs soon to check everything.

Thank you for the help."
Anxiety,Alone over the weekend,"Tw: Hypochondria, dependency 

My roommate (living together for six years) and best friend is going to meet up with his brother for three days. 

It’s fair to say that I am rather dependent on him and that it makes me very anxious when he’s not around for some time. I don’t have any emergency contacts nearby and am dealing with hypochondria quite a bit. 

I know that I’ll be okay and I want to use this time to work on the dependency and actually make something nice out of this time. Any advice on how to distract myself in case I start feeling unsafe?"
Anxiety,Mini blackout? What happened to me?,"So, I struggle with general and social anxiety, this much i know. I was trying to show my mom a video when there was like, a time lapse of sorts where his words (guy in the video) just didn't match up with his next words, like the video suddenly skipped a beat and there was a fraction I had missed. I asked my mom if she saw that and she said she didn't, and I went back and saw the video doesn't skip there... it was just for like a fraction of a second where I think I may have been completely absent. I've tried Google but still don't understand. 

For what it's worth, my mom is a major trigger for me and my family is, in general, toxic and abusive and I dont know why I come here (their place)... I thought getting out the house might help me feel more sane lol. That was a very jarring experience.. i don't know if I'm blowing things up or not.

Anxiety,Is 7 months of lexapro enough time to get off it ?,"I’ve been on lexapro 10 mg for 7 months now, it got rid of the anxiety and depression about a month after first taking it but I was told I should keep taking it for at least 6 months, I’m on 7 months now and was wondering is it ok to stop now without the anxiety and depression returning ? the side effects such as low libido are the main reason I want to stop"
Anxiety,Mentality,I’m not sure why I put negative thoughts into my head but it caused me to sorta have an issue talk with my gf. Things are just sorta not okay and I’m literally just doing this to myself and hurting myself and putting scenarios in my own head I’m trying to work on this but each time I try and think I’m progressing it seems like I’m progressing backwards. As of right now and sorta the past few hours I’ve just been accepting that I messed up and expressed that I messed up and apologized repeatedly but after a while people get tired of hearing apologies. She deserves more and I want to stop being the way that I am because I hurt my gfs emotions and feelings and I wish things could just be okay.

Anxiety,Going to go to a family friend party tomorrow. Super nervous about it.,Been feeling super pressured to make conversation there.

I've changed a lot over the years and i think they might not like me that much anymore.
Anxiety,Here we go. This is my intro/support post. Wish I could do multiple flairs.,"Hello everyone. I'm 41 years old, and feel like I've slipped through the cracks of society/life, someone that the world doesn't care to really help. Anyone else feel like that?

Anyways, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression issues. I'm a pretty emotional guy and tend to cry a lot over things. I tend to excessively worry about things, but my brain kind of doesn't handle the worrying aspect correctly. I'll worry about things BEFORE I'm supposed to worry about them, like I'll be scared that something COULD happen, then when it doesn't happen, I'll kick myself for excessively worrying and spending all that energy in worrying over nothing. I always tend to blow things out of proportion and think of the worst possible scenarios.

Because I have GAD and other issues, I'm on SSDI and haven't had any sort of gainful employment in over 10 years. I'd like to get a job, but I feel helpless. As far as my past employment goes, none of the places I've worked at even exist anymore. So it's not like any previous employers could call them for references. I might as well have never worked a day in my life.

Relationships have never been that great for me either. Relationships with me are short and intense. It tends to go like this... stuff is great at first, then inevitably she ""gets busy"", doesn't text me as often, then will just ghost me completely. I'll ask if it was anything I said or did and she'll assure me it wasn't, even though I know it is. I'm usually lucky if I get a couple months out of relationship.

I see a psychiatrist about all this, even though she helps, I feel like she's not REALLY ""helping"", know what I mean?

So it'll always end up with me and my cat alone in my apartment.

Mental health issues are truly awful aren't they?

I need the hug and support flair too, but figured I'd do the introduction first."
Anxiety,As needed meds that are safe for recovering alcoholic,"Hey guys,

So after years of managing my anxiety with varying degrees of success, I am finally considering medication. My anxiety is not constant and I want to start as small as possible. I have slightly high blood pressure (125/83 range). I was wondering if beta blockers can be used as needed, so if it is something I can use sparingly when i'm really in a rut. Benzos are right out for me because of my drinking history. SSRIs would be a last resort, and I would be on the fence about that. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
Anxiety,what kind of Anxiety is this and how to beat it?,"Hey Everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So i been reading some self help books because i been do psychologists in the past due to my anxiety over my health. I been very stressed out lately and have been having some weird anxiety symptoms that if i tell my family members they would think im crazy. For example i play world of Warcraft if anyone has ever heard of it. I am to afraid to play the warlock affliction class because if i play that class I will get a disease in real life like what?!? Also when i say my prayers before bed i hold my breath and if i exhale before i finish i have to start over again. I wont tell my fiancé this because she wont understand. Im assuming to overcome this i would need to do some sort of exposure therapy so play the game and then think nothing will happen and like not hold my breath and see what happens but easier said then done lol. So thats the loop im stuck on and now i got that OCD anxiety with my health again."
Anxiety,I’m sick of what anxiety does to my life,"I’m trying to get a job 1) so I don’t starve and 2) so I can escape a toxic home on a more permanent basis. Rejection after rejection later I finally got a chance.

The biggest triggers of my panic/anxiety attacks is being on camera and being recorded. I need this money but this is one hurdle I cannot jump yet.

I’m just tired of it all. I’m trying to find employment that suits me better but I never even get to interview with those jobs. 

I’m lucky to have the resources I do. I could theoretically fall back on someone but, that would mean asking my abuser for help when thats what this money is supposed to help me get away from.

Anxiety,**sigh** overbreathing …,"Hi guys, im 20 and I’ve been dealing with this halfway manual breathing thing for almost a week and I know it’s something that I have to deal with but I’m having trouble :/  I know there are always ppl on Reddit that can help with anything so bare with me 🙏🏽

This whole thing started because 1 night, I saw something on TV about hearts that kinda spooked me and because of the spooking, it made me hyperventilate a little and for some reason it carried on into the following morning.
 Now I’m at this weird point. I know that I’m fine ! I keep telling myself I’m fine, I’m healthy n all, but idk. 

Like… as of recently it seems that when I’m alone, I can’t help but think about my breathing. It’s annoying asf ! HOWEVER when I’m laying down on my phone, scrolling or talking to my friends/ in conversation, most of the time I’m good, I forget it completely ! 
But idk, once I stand up I tell myself “hey it stopped !” But me saying that triggers it again.
I can’t help but spectate myself due to me subconsciously hoping it stops (contradicting Ik..🤦🏾‍♂️) but it always links back to it 😖

I’ve always been a very anxious person. If you’re into astrology, im a Virgo and we tend to overthink EVERYTHING. I used to have a problem that I always noticed my heartbeat whenever it skipped a beat. I would think there was something wrong with me and until I went to a doctor to actually check my heart and say I was fine, my anxiety started coming to an end. I was still kinda anxious for a couple days after but then, through deep breaths and time I guess I just got distracted enough from it to finally ignore/accept it. Even if I can feel my heartbeat now, it can notice it for a couple seconds and forget about it.
But my breath is different :/ idk how to trick my mind into accepting this one. Never dealt with this before.
There’s so many things I’m not thinking about, idk why breathing is there.
I’m always down now and eating feels like I’m for forcing myself to cuz of this weird anxious feeling in my abdomen that always reminds me.. 
plz help 😪🙏🏽"

Anxiety,Might’ve fucked up my job/boss is conduction a sneaky beaky investigation.,"My boss is like secretly investigating me and my employees at my job because some beer went missing in one of the fridges. 

He’s like watching me and my brother,(we’re supervisors), and talking to other employees about how we work together and if us and the other two guys on our team, (we’re friends with the two, and there’s 6 people, sometimes 7 total on the team;we’re all friendsly) are being all buddy buddy and not putting them to work and just fucking off. He told one of our other employees that ‘we’re not stupid’, referring to our company, and ‘that there’s cameras’ and asked if he drinks and when he said yes he told him to just not do it at work.  

we’re not really not getting any complaints except the beer. everything looks pretty good. He even said so himself, there’s some small things to improve on, but they’re easy fixes. 

He brought up the beer at the beginning of shift and said it had happened like three or four times before with previous employees and they just lock that kitchen it’s in and ask for a reimbursement for the missing beer. He didn’t accuse anyone, but has just been poking around today and will be at work the next two or three days.  

Shit just gives me anxiety, I need this job. It’s like am I gonna get written up for this? Get fired? Why does it gotta be all sneaky and why are my brother and I being spied on? He’s like secretly talking to our employees about shit and they’re not saying anything/bringing it up to us and being like you should watch out cause we got this shit pinned on us when there’s at least 300 other people that could have taken them"

I've always been sure that anytime someone drives anywhere and I am not with them that they will get in a car accident. 
I was doing a bit better with this. I'm now fine with my husband leaving and bringing dinner back. 
Tomorrow he's taking a day trip with his family to an event about 3 or 4 hours away. I've had a rough week at work so we all agree I shouldnt go. 
I thought I was fine, I hadn't been worrying about it all week. But last night I had my worst panic attack in months and couldnt calm down.
If I look at his face I become filled with a sense that this is the last time I'll see it.
He shared his phone location data with me so I can be sure they're not in any danger and my current plan is to just keep busy with chores to try and distract myself while he's gone. I also do have some sedatives prescribed for a panic disorder that I can take if I get too upset.

Anxiety,My intrusive thoughts are back,"TW: talking about existence, paranoia, panic attacks, ocd tendancies, thoughts about su1c1d3 

17F here. 

In March I got off of prozac. I took 40mg once a day, every day. I was prescribed it by my family doctor who said I definitely had anxiety. I had 200+ intrusive thoughts a day, and was constantly crying. I couldn't do anything without have a panic attack, and I would wake up in the middle of the night constantly multiple times. I got off of prozac because I didn't need it anymore. I went cold turkey without my doctor knowing, but it was okay because I felt fine without them. 

Now it's July and I'm now starting to fall into constant paranoia. I'm stressed because I'm still feeling the aftermath of my grandmother's (who was like a parent to me) death and am anxious about living with my stepsister who moved into my house a few weeks ago. 

I'm getting intrusive thoughts all the time. Here's some examples:

• if you do _ your soul will be gone
• you didn't sleep last night? Guess your immortal maybe you'll never sleep again
• say _ so that your mom won't die today

I get them around 10-20 times a day. 

I can't deal with these. Paired with my intrusive thoughts and probable depression, my urge to di3 us quite strong. I don't want to, and don't plan to, but if these thoughts keep getting worse and turn to 200+ a day I don't know what I'll do. 

Please help me I'm very scared and I feel alone. I'm scared that my thoughts aren't fake. I'm sleep deprived from not being able to sleep last night (even with melatonin) and am physically shaking because I'm cold and tired and anxious. I'm scared."

Sees people hanging out with friends on social media

I want to have a nice dinner party with friends
↓
I have friends but not true friends 
↓
I should make new friends, find my ‘people’ 
↓
Most people are annoying once I get close to them
↓
It’s probably not the their fault, there must be something terribly wrong with me, oh god I am selfish, critical, reserved, Im probably undeserving of nurturing relationships

Withdraws from social situations, gets depressed, and spends more time on social media 


My social life makes me feel like a massive failure  especially so because I desire to feel a genuine connection and be seen yet it over and over again proves to be impossible/unattainable."
Anxiety,My 25th Birthday,"The 1 time I decide to plan an actual birthday party this year, only 3 people actually confirmed to show up. I'm not a party person at all, but it was really important for me to surround myself with people I actually care about for tomorrow. 


The fact that only 3 people were actually going to attend has put me in a major negative mood. Tomorrow is going to be my 25th birthday &amp; now I don't know whether to take a photography trip, or stay in bed all day tomorrow. 


The crazy thing is that the 3 people I knew would definitely show up, were the only 3 that confirmed. It may seem like a small thing, but I'm legit upset. I'm always there for the rest of the crew, &amp; I've never really had parties on my birthday growing up, but I'm legit hurt. This is the 1 time I've ever really asked the collective to do this 1 thing for me. I'm hurt."

Anxiety,Awful nightmares after like 2 days on busporine..?,"Hi everyone,

I've been on Prozac for a little longer than a month now, and it made my anxiety go through the roof. My psychiatrist prescribed me busporine to help, and I only started taking it like 2 days ago.

Anxiety,I need tips to calm down but I don't like the usual calming videos you find on YouTube,"Hey, so I get terrible anxiety during term break and it's worse this year because I'm on my final year of school.
I struggle making myself sleep cos I constantly want to puke and cry every night after all my friends and family go to bed (no distractions ig). 
I can't do my work anymore and I constantly feel like shit.

Basically I don't like the anxiety reducing videos on YouTube cos it's kinda boring. The background noise can be useful sometimes but I prefer songs with vocals and listening to people talk about things other than anxiety.

Do you guys have any calming music (I'm thinking Paul by Big Thief, Tamino, Eliot Moss, Hozier, etc) or YouTube videos that you use as background noise to sleep?

I used to listen to Mark, Wade and Bob play raft but I can't find anything similar to that.

Any recommendations are appreciated."
Anxiety,Does anyone else get this?,"When you're really anxious do any of you notice your vision change, for some reason when i'm about to have a panic attack, my vision brightens and it hones in on my surrounding."
Anxiety,I feel like everyone around me is judging my every move,"I don't know if anyone else ever feels like this. I'm sure some definitely will.

Sometimes I feel like no matter who I'm around or where I am, even if literally no one is thinking about me, I feel like everyone I know is thinking about me or wondering what I'm doing and what I'm up to at all times of the day.

It feels like this huge weight that everyone is judging my every action. Maybe some are; and maybe it's as a result of past trauma of some treating me as such.

I just want to live outside of my head and feel fulfilled and happy with what I am doing instead of constantly feeling compromised and victimised by society and the people around me feeling as if they are sabotaging it or about to.

Some people have called this imposter syndrome; after some reflection I do believe I suffer from it. But I don't necessarily ever feel like I don't earn where I am. I guess to an extent; I do experience this.

It's fucking awful and I just want to feel like I am strong enough to not care of other people's opinions of me and feeling like everyone is thinking about me all the time. I come up with scenarios in my head about what they could be saying or thinking about me. Even if they are and even if it's only for a split second, my brain will imagine like it's happening all the time.

It becomes so extreme the only thing that puts a stop to it is being busy and being surrounded by faily or friends.

It's a difficult one. I hope I can get through this."

Anxiety,Trying to stay calm and thinking the worst,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder right here and PTSD. So last year my mom died last year(July 1st), I witnessed everything and had to be the one to call my Dad. It’s been a rough year and he’s had a rough go. It’s been a stressful week, but I’ve been keeping myself preoccupied so I don’t fly off the edge. I’ve been trying to call my Dad last night and he hasn’t answered. Left two messages. He can be oblivious and forget to check the caller ID and I know he’s upset still about my mom and maybe he just doesn’t want to talk. But my head is going to a very dark place. My grandfather lasted just a year and a half after my grandmother died - so I’m kinda freaking out. I’m going to head over later if I don’t hear anything. 

I’m shaking on my couch, trying not to overeat and thinking of every worst case scenario and how I’m going to handle it all and this fool probably just doesn’t want to talk and not thinking about his actions affects everyone else. 

I’m just acting stupid and it’s probably fine. But the whole what if thing keeps popping in my head and I know I should go clean or do something to take my mind off it, but it’s hard."

I struggle especially with men, they love gratitude for sure but I treat everything they do for me as obvious thing.

I also fell while expressing gratitude that I'm making myself lower than the other person, humiliate myself and feel like a servant to my master. So I tend to avoid this kind of situation, therefore I don't say gratitude words towards other person and they think I'm mean and ungrateful.

Why is it so hard for me to be grateful for the things people do for me and why do I take is as an obvious think as they should serve me to gain my affection?"

It also has completely taken over my life for as long as I can remember. When I was in school, I was bullied because of my social anxiety because I would never ever talk at school. I wanted to, but just couldn’t get the words out. Now, as an adult, the same thing is happening but different situation. I’ve had a couple jobs but they didn’t last very long. At every job I had, I got discriminated against because of my anxiety. Even when I’ve tried to put myself out there and go to job interviews, they could tell that I was shy and had anxiety which doesn’t make me look like a good candidate. I’ve tried looking for a new job now for quite awhile and I’ve had zero luck. I feel so stuck with life. I feel so unmotivated due to this. I’m an adult now and I still live at home because I’m basically dependent still due to my crippling anxiety. I’m also on 20mg of Prozac and I still feel anxious and nothing is helping. I even get jealous of other people my age that are living their best life. Getting jobs, moving out, having kids, not overthinking everything……"
Anxiety,"My anxiety the last month, the physical symptoms, the hospital visits, and how I handled it!","About 1 month ago I start having difficulty swallowing. It almost felt like my tongue was swelling and I was no longer able to eat. I went to the hospital to have lots of tests ran and they were finding nothing. They actually said maybe it's acid reflux and prescribed me some meds for that.

Those mods did not work after 3 weeks of taking it. 2 weeks ago I decided to start counseling and to see a naturopath doctor. I've done 2 counseling sessions and bought lots of supplements from my naturopath doctor. These both combined started to work at relieving the discomfort I had going on in my throat and toungue.

2 days ago I decided to pick up meditation..... This right here was the game changer I believe. After day 1 of meditation I felt slightly better. After day 2 of meditation I felt 10x better. I have no idea why and how but it was 10 minute sessions that did so much relief!! I was skeptical about meditation, but I cannot believe it's working so well.

Anyways, what I wanted to get to here is that I thought I wA absolutely sick. But it looks like the problem is anxiety which is causing unbelievable real symptoms. A mix of counseling, naturopath, and Meditation absolutely helped 1 million percent in such a short time! I hope this message gets to someone experiencing slightly the same as me and can find reassurance that it's not permanent the way you are feeling and there's many ways to help tackle it!

I'm an open ear if you ever need. Dm"
Anxiety,Dealing with fear of your own medicine,"Hey guys, been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks since 2019. Couple months back i had a real big flair up after having a panic attack in my car. Doc told me to go back on lexapro, but I was taking 25mg of Amitryptiline already and all i could do was worry about serotonin toxicity... took it one day and had the worst panic attack at 4am. After that ive been terrified of my own meds. Saw the doc yesterday and he prescribed buspirone instead and gave me a scrip for ativan for emergencies. Still on the ami though, and cant take the buspirone because of the fear... cant take the ativan to calm down for the same reason. Tried hydroxizine a couple weeks ago, same issue. Has anyone dealt with this? How did you break the cycle? I know i need to ""just take my meds"" but the fear is so intense i just know im going to give myself a panic attack. Im starting a new job tuesday (technically returning to a job i was laid off from during covid) and i just want to get the shit levelled off so i can work and not have more panic attacks at work. 

Super long and i apologize. Thanks guys. Anxiety fucking sucks."
Anxiety,Trazadone or actual panic attack?,"I take trazadone for sleep and never exactly had much issues with it. Last night I took them and was watching a show..about 5-10 mins later I felt this wave of nerves through me, felt shortness of breath and it made me jolt up. I felt my heart start pounding/racing and was scared I needed an ER.

Its upsetting worrying if it was the meds or a panic attack happened at thr wrong time. Now I'm scared to take trazadone and scared I won't get sleep for work. 

I think I'm filing for disability...I cant do this."
Anxiety,I have an interview in just under a week - any tips?,"I can't bring myself to prepare for it - partly because I'm not sure how to and partly because of my anxiety. I keep focusing on what I am lacking instead of being confident in my skills and experiences- they must've seen something in my written application to have offered me the interview!

Would really appreciate it if anyone could provide any useful advice! TIA!"
Anxiety,Should I beat myself up about being awkward in public?,Someone told me everyone is awkward so I shouldn't worry about it. It's just difficult not to.
Anxiety,Do I Need Medication?,"I can't do confrontation. If someone is mad at me, regardless if I'm in the right or wrong, I shut down for a couple of hours. 

It's werid. When it comes to some things, I can handle it well. Job interviews for example (I just graduated), I've done plenty of them and while I'm not perfect, I tend to conduct myself well regardless. It's only when someone is upset with me."
Anxiety,Leaving for vacation..,"On Monday I’ll be hopping into the car to drive 16 hours to maryland , and about 2 weeks ago I started Zoloft, it has worked pretty well as I’ve had zero panic attacks in that time frame or 2 weeks, but as the day inches closer I can feel the butterflies in my chest and panic starting to set in, even while medicated, is that normal? And will it subside with the medicine during its peak time (4.5-8 hours after taking it) . My trigger has always been leaving the house and every long car ride I’ve ever been on I deal with excruciating stomach pain, vomiting and nausea as soon as I get in the car. It’s safe to say I’m scared, I haven’t had to do anything THIS big in terms of my anxiety for a while. Just looking for any advice or anyone who has also taken Zoloft on how it works and will effect the situation"
Anxiety,Im 18yrs/o (M) i recently graduated from highschool and my anxiety got worse,"For a long time i knew that something was wrong but i didn't think it worth addressing. It was so bad that it affected my grades until grade 11. It got worse after a almost lost a friend and that made the anxiety get worse. After building up enough confidence to go on a stage for academic events it all just left when the panic atracks kept coming. I couldn't stop feeling like people i cared about were going to kill themseleves and even if i tried my best to convince them not to i wasn't a good enough reason. Due to covid schools closed and we were all waiting for what next to do. That gave me time to get most of myself together and eventually I got into a relationship with a really close friend of mine. I was afraid to care about someone even more afraid but i just took it as a chance for me to get over the trauma i experienced. Because of that relationship i was even able to pass my finals last year. It was an online relationship and we hoped to meet in person and we did. With time i noticed that this person was different from being online and i loved her even more because i got to see the real her. She wasn't that big on physical intimacy but i didnt mind and i respected the boundaries. We broke up after 1 year and almost 2 months. It didn't end on bad terms and we never argued on serious topics. We both gave our best into the relationship but at some point she doubted her own feelings. I didn't get why she felt that way even though she couldnt help but say she loved me. The day we broke up i found out that she had a mixed bipolar disorder and she was having a manic episode when we first started dating. She said she still loved me but not in a romantic way and she said that things wont change(except the lovey dovey parts). I honestly dont want to let her go and she feels the same. We've both helped each other in getting better and she's the one who encouraged me to tell my parents about my panic attacks.
I told them about my anxiety and it made me feel worse because i finally admitted that it is a problem and i needed help. I started twitching and i felt so heavy.
My mom's very religous and told me to pray on it and read the bible which btw didnt make the situation better for me.
Its been a month now and I'm getting better. My parents are hesitating to take me to a therapist because they are worried that I'll starting taking meds which will only make me worse so i do therapy over the phone with proffessionals that will notify them on whether meds would be appropriate or not.
Im supposed to start university next year and I'm honestly worried about how I'll perform then. On top of that i realised that i might have social anxiety and would explain why i constantly feel like people are looking at me and judging what i wear( which i managed to train my mind to not care about) but constantly feeling that way each time i go out makes me feel a little uneasy. 


I know this was quite a lot and i hope you got my perspecrive on the explanation. But I'm just wondering if it's possible to go without meds and if they're bad for anxiety."
Anxiety,My brain feels so fragile..,"After I got my second concussion in January, my head felt a lot l more fragile then before. I can’t even shake my head without feeling a moving sensation in my head"
Anxiety,Anyone had propranolol?,"My Dr prescribed me it for anxiety, the only problem is it’s been making me having a tingling feeling in my arms and that just makes me more anxious, is it normal for that to happen?"
Anxiety,Extreme interview anxiety,"I have extreme interview anxiety to the point that I can’t formulate proper sentences, I have huge gaps of time where I am frozen and don’t know what to say, and I’m noticeably shaking/trembling. I have a one hour 5-person panel interview today for a paralegal position and I have no prior paralegal experience. I am incredibly nervous to the point that I feel like I’m going to throw up. I completely ruined every interview or job opportunity I’ve had thus far because of my nerves. Does anyone else have experience in this and overcoming it?"
Anxiety,Received a wake up call this Morning,"Hi all. 

I'm currently writing this from work with shaky hands, a racing heart and a overall sense of dread, panic &amp; a slight feeling of nausea. I got to work this morning with a slight headache, not sure why. I'm hypoglycemic so if my blood sugar drops then I'll get a headache. I stopped at my local grocery store before work &amp; picked up two 20oz bottles of Mt.Dew Baja Blast and a package of 4 chocolate brownies, not the healthiest breakfast but usually drinking a soda will help with the headache. About a hour &amp; a half later &amp; after eating one browning and drinking most of the first soda, my body was telling me I had to go to the bathroom. I sat down and then it hit me. The nausea, the shaking, the sharp pain in my gut from what I guess is the mixture of soda and chocolate. I finished up, walked to the sink &amp; dry heaved heavily twice. Started shaking more, panicking, sweating &amp; trying to breathe more steadily. I ran some cold water on my face, took a few big sips from the faucet and low &amp; behold, things rapidly went back to normal. 

The point of this post &amp; long novel (I apologize) is that I'm done with soda. For good. This is twice in the same week that drinking a soda has just wrecked me with nausea, panic and overall sense of ""I'm going to get sick and I can't stop it"" and honestly, I'm tired of it. I like soda, but I like not feeling like a big ball of anxiety &amp; panic as well. I have a really nice TAL stainless steel water bottle I drink from daily &amp; maybe it's just my body adjusting to the water intake because I really have only been drinking pop 1-2 times a week and drinking more water, tea &amp; juice instead. So is it possible this is my body rejecting soda? Either way, this is the wake up call I needed. Soda, while delicious does absolutely nothing positive for my body anymore. The Baja blast didn't even taste all that good this morning. 

Have a good weekend everyone, thanks for listening to me vent, lol."
Anxiety,Propranolol with pre-existing bradycardia,"I realize this a question I should ask my doctor, but I was wondering if anyone here could offer some insight or if anyone had a similar experience they could share.

I have realized that my problems stem primarily from physiological rather than mental symptoms, and I have discovered that people with this sort of anxiety response seem to respond well to propranolol. I'm tired of completely sweating through my shirt whenever I have to answer a question during one of my classes, and no amount of breathing awareness or cognitive reframing has helped.

The only thing that gives me pause is related to the drug's effect on heart rate. I am pretty well conditioned. I've been awake for 4 ish hours or so and my heart rate is currently 48 bpm. So I'm wondering if taking this medication would drop my heart rate to potentially dangerously low levels.

Of course, my heart rate spikes during typical social/performance anxiety situations, and I would be planning on taking the medication on an as needed basis, so maybe there wouldn't be an adverse effect? But at the same time, unless I know with certainty that an event like a presentation is upcoming, it's hard for me to know when I'll be in a situation where I'd truly need it

Again, I know these are questions for a physician, but I wanted to see how much information I could gather prior to discussing this with my doctor. Does anyone have experience taking this (or a similar med) with an already low HR?"
Anxiety,My partners parents give me anxiety,My in laws give me a lot of anxiety. I guess it is a bit out of my control. I want to like them but I find it hard. Face to face were nice to each other and you wouldn’t tell I didn’t like them that much. Their parenting style is quite strict and I almost find them a bit controlling. Her dad is very opinionated and expects my girlfriend to share the same beliefs. Her mum gaslights my partner a lot and will often overreact to stuff she’s done. I find her quite clingy too and she always wants to outstay her welcome or come over unexpectedly. In my head they’re the worst although I know there’s probably worse and I find it very stressful knowing I might be dealing with these people for the rest of my life. How can I learn better to cope?
Anxiety,Do you feel fear or feel scared when you're anxious?,I'm a very anxious person but all I feel are the effects of adrenaline rushes and general mental discomfort rather than anything else. I'm wondering how normal this is.
Anxiety,My train of thoughts,"Do something a little bit out of the ordinary (be it saying something, doing a certain  action, etc.)
|
|
Start thinking Something is wrong so I try and figure out what it is
|
|
Don’t find good answer; begin thinking that this thing is gonna make me a horrible person
|
|
Eventually devolves into me bullying myself because of it 
|
|
Go to sleep; wake up the next day and the cycle repeats 

I don’t know how to break out of it. This whole thing is like the dirty bomb of my anxiety. It doesn’t do a whole lot physically but it just lingers for a long time"
Anxiety,Do you think i have an anxiety disorder??,"I have been struggling with anxiety nearly everyday for the past 5 years. I worry alot and always feel nervous and worry about the future all the time. I cannot control my worry and feel anxious most of the time. And when i finally relax (which takes me a long time to achieve) i feel paranoid on when im going to have anxiety next. I know i am going to be okay. And im not sad, unhappy ect. I am happy. I just deal with anxiety all the time, outside, on my own ect."
Anxiety,I have been diagnosed as having anxiety,"My brain didn’t want to believe it. For many years I thought “it’s got to be something else”. But after some proper research it does make sense. Maybe some of you guys can tell me what you think of it too. First of all I don’t really worry about stuff that might or might not happen. My main symptoms are overthinking, feelings of dread, getting stressed easily, feeling passive (like passive socially and in my hobbies too). I always thought anxiety was worrying about something unrealistic like “my planes going to crash tomorrow!” but after some research my diagnosis is making more sense. I feel like a timid little mouse some days and I really beat myself up over it. If something mildly negative happens to me I become overwhelmed and think it’s the worst thing ever. Whilst sometimes other things that bother other people don’t really effect me"
Anxiety,Help going to auto repair shop,"Hi everyone, I need some repairs on my car and fortunately have never had to get them done before (this is my first car). The AC is broken and one window wont roll down. 

What do I say to the workers at the repair place? Do I need to make an appointment or pull in? Should I call ahead of time? Should I have someone else follow me so I have a ride?  I just want to know what to expect. I'm anxious to show that I don't know what I'm doing as I don't want to get ripped off. I've been putting this off for quite a while but the heat is just too much now and I need to get it done. Any advice appreciated"
Anxiety,Anxiety related shortness of breath?,"I suffer from illness anxiety but for the last 3 days I’ve noticed I’ve had shortness of breath almost constantly. There are points in the day where I feel fine. I can walk, pick up heavy things and not feel shortness of breathe. I’ve decided going to the ER will almost be completely pointless as I’m 100% this is all anxiety and in my head and thinking about it keeping it going. Does anyone have any breathing techniques?"
Anxiety,Here’s to change.,"We all want it. We tell ourselves we will get the help we need or do better the night before and wake up and start the same routine over again. That’s okay though. You see the problem that’s something a lot of individuals can’t detect. You have to be patient. You have to change something small at first and gradually build up to the big stuff. 

Anxiety and depression are two things that will run your life. You have to remain strong. I wish I can take your pain away. I truly do. 

A lot of families don’t believe in mental illness. Like my family. They think it’s just an excuse and sometimes I do use as one. Just because your family thinks your anxiety and depression is fake doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get the help you need. 

You have to want to change for yourself. Don’t do it for anyone but you. You aren’t broken. You aren’t damaged. Like I said we are just wired differently. I’m proud of you and I will always be proud of you."
Anxiety,Just finished last day of job that has ruined my mental and physical health for the last 8 months! 🎉,"Had horrible bosses that paid me minimum wage to do an 'assistant' but actually managers job of taking care of all of the marketing and sales for their company.

Endless sales calls, social media scheduling getting us into awards finals, writing up interviews pretending to be the owner because she never wanted to know and ignored my calls and messages, with never any credit.

They refused to have  a career progression interview with me because apparently I hadn't made enough sales when they had interviews with all of the newbies that did other types of jobs (accountants). 

Really stuck my neck on the line trying to please them everyday and my physical and mental health has really suffered.

But anyway I served a two week notice (even though they tried to get me to do a month) and it feels sooo good to be out!

Start my new job as a home carer In a weeks time 😊 hopefully will be really rewarding."
Anxiety,I watched a movie for the first time in 2 months,"It wasn’t just any movie it was a horror slasher movie. The new Fear Street part 1 film on Netflix. It’s just something small, I’m definitely not all the way better. I still can barely walk and feel like I’m falling every time I do walk or look around but I managed to watch an entire movie start to finish. I had to pause it every so often, mostly around the half way mark towards the end but I got through it. Before I’ve only managed to watch a 20 minute episode of something here or there and barely could get through that and had to take like 5 minute breaks every few minutes. I’m nervous about celebrating this bc when I think I’m getting better my mind and body always reminds me that I’m not getting better somehow. Ugh"
Anxiety,How bad is bad enough to seek help?,"I don’t know if this seems like a dumb question, but it troubles me. 

I am quite ashamed of my mental health struggles and I always think - am I just too weak to work through my issues, or too lazy to overcome my anxiety, or too spoiled so I’m terrified of everything, or in any shape or form have some sort of personality flaw, or unconsciously exaggerating my troubles? 

If I show up to counselling with what turns out to be objectively trivial issues they’ll think I’m wasting their time right?

How do I know whether my problems are bad enough to seek help?"
Anxiety,zoning out awfully too much,"i just can't concentrate, even after calling out myself to get back to reality, it wouldn't take a minute for me zone out again"
Anxiety,DAE obsess over the embarrassing things that could've happened but didn't?,I have enough cringe moments in my life to overthink and somehow I've started to overthink the embarrassing things that could've happened but didn't. Is anyone else like this?
Anxiety,I beat myself up over mistakes when I'm driving,"Does anyone else have this? Like today I screwed up reversing out of my driveway and had to restart my manoeuvre. No big deal right? Well tell that to my brain, I can't stop beating myself up over it :("
Anxiety,Can someone explain this?,"I wake up everyday at around 5 AM to pee, then return to bed but just can’t get myself to sleep. As soon as I hit the bed, I feel this all consuming anxiety that I just can’t shake off almost like an attack. It catches me offguard and keeps me awake for hours, ruining my sleep. It’s a relatively recent thing for me."
Anxiety,reducing tolerance," I take benzos for anxiety and at the same time every day I get twitchy. its almost like I get minor interdose withdrawals. thinking its time to cut back. if I were to stop taking my Lorazepam 2mg a day for like a week, what would happen?"
Anxiety,reducing benzo tolerance," I take benzos for anxiety and at the same time every day I get twitchy. its almost like I get minor interdose withdrawals. thinking its time to cut back. if I were to stop taking my Lorazepam 2mg a day for like a week, what would happen?

Anxiety,It's my cake day,Yay it's my cake day?!
Anxiety,Nervous about restarting SSRI's/My Story," Hey guys, first time posting here! Been on the SSRI journey since late 2019. I have GAD and OCD which has been crippling for as long as I can remember. My mother is the same way so my anxiety is most likely genetic/ due to some trauma I had growing up. Anyways, started Zoloft late 2019 after years of family members and boyfriends saying I shouldn't and to just meditate and other bs that never worked. At the time of starting Zoloft, I had been (still am) in a relationship with a very understanding, loving man who really accepted my anxiety and wanted to support me. We've been together since 2017, but in 2019 my anxiety and ocd symptoms had hit a peak. The intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, dermatillomania, ruminating, and depression that comes from all that was really affecting me and my relationship. So I decided I didn't want to live like that anymore and started 25mg of Zoloft. The highest dose I went to was just 50mg but oh man it was a game changer. Everything was so much more manageable and I was able to think more logically when intrusive thoughts would pop up.

Throughout this time I was still struggling with the side effects despite how happy I was. The sexual side effects bothered me a lot since I've always been a very sexual person, and then there was the weight gain. I gained about 40 lbs while on Zoloft in the 2ish years I was on it. I've always been a slender woman, and it was very hard seeing my body transform so quickly. I will also note I had an eating disorder growing up as well, but luckily have since recovered so I have not gone back to that despite this big change. I decided to stop in Jan 2021 because of all this. A few months after stopping I was still able to manage my anxiety pretty well and even got a therapist. Losing the weight has been close to impossible. I've always had a high metabolism and after reading a lot about SSRI's I learned that it does affect some people's metabolism and their ability to lose weight even after stopping the medicine. That's been really hard to deal with but I've come to accept this new body I have. Overall I was doing pretty great up until May. I've definitely been struggling again. The intrusive thinking, panic attacks, and depression have really hit me. I've missed work, got in a lot of fights with my bf, and have just been very unhappy. Recently my boyfriend considered breaking up with me because it's gotten to be too much.

I am now reconsidering going back on Zoloft or trying a new ssri, but tbh I'm terrified. I do believe I've made a lot of improvements on my own via therapy, reading book, self care, mantras, etc. But that being said, I do feel sometimes like my anxiety is still so unbearable and painful that the only way to fully fix this is to go back on meds. I hate knowing how my anxiety affects those around me, my work, and my self-worth. I'm just really stuck and lost. I don't want to gain anymore weight, I feel content with the weight I'm at now, but I don't think I can handle anymore. The libido thing also sucks, cause I feel like only now have I just started to get mine back after all these months since stopping Zoloft. Also worried about the initial/withdrawal side effects again. This is such a big decision and I feel like my relationship/job/life is on the line. If anyone has any advice or can share their experience that would be amazing! Sorry this was so long xP

TLDR: Scared or restarting Zoloft/any SSRI due to weight gain/libido issues, but anxiety is so bad right now it's causing relationship issues, work issues, and depression. Plz share your experience/needing advice"
Anxiety,Suffer from really bad chest pain,"I have been suffering from chest had it checked out by cardiologist been to the er 7 times in 14 days all ECG and  blood test and a chest x-ray was normal
I suffer from anxiety , gerd and have gall stones, recently I have been feeling pain in my throat left side when swallowing I panicked and ignored it. Next I felt when swallowing as thought food was stuck in my throat , I googled and saw esophagus issues such as narrowing I had a barium study and it show acid reflux I'm.worried one year after if it narrowed my esophagus after seeing the article and have been having more bad chest and feel like the food is stuck there . Is this anxiety since I saw the article or just acid reflux and not my esophagus narrowed er doctor told me to just take dexilant and go home . My chest hurts in the middle and closer to my diaphragm more."
Anxiety,Medications,I'm currently taking hydroxizine for my anxiety but I would like something a bit stronger. What are some medications I can ask my doctor for.
Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel like people ask way too personal questions sometimes?,When hanging out sometimes it feels like an interrogation or phishing attack asking me way too personal stuff. I am way too open when inebriated and I sometimes 🤔 think about hey why are they saying these weird things? What the hell oh my god they think I am like that? Wtf guys..... I got into crypto to make money and some old thinkers still think it has something to do with crime or silk road....
Anxiety,I feel anxious around my family,"I grew up happy as a kid until my teens when my parents became very strict. My family is Mexican Catholic living in the US and my siblings are all girls. To have more freedom, I went away for college at 18 and have lived in another city ever since.

Now, even though things are better in terms of getting along, every time I visit I feel anxious with my family and want to leave. I worry about what to talk about, I feel guilty when they want to do activities I don't want to do, and I get sad I don't like spending time with them. When I spend time with my husband's family, I feel way happier and less pressure. Idk, I just feel like I want to go back to my free life.

Any tips for working through this discomfort? Any YouTube channels or Instagram accounts you recommend?"
Anxiety,Help please,"So i been pretty much anxious my entire life since i was a teenager and since it wasn't treated of course it gotten worse, now that i am unemployed and constantly overthinking my anxiety can wake me up anytime , the way i describe it is that i wake up fearful and like being shocked by a defibrillator.
Anything i can do?"
Anxiety,For literally anyone reading this,"Hey,

I know I’m a stranger on the internet but if anyone ever needs someone to talk to, rant to, or whatever it is, just know that I am here for each and every one of you who dms me.

Rest assured, I will reply as quickly as I am able, but just know that someone is here for you always. Everything will stay confidential and anonymous and I can promise that.

Please look after yourselves. Light and love,

Anxiety,Any suggestions for comfort content?,"I can't focus or pay attention to anything during severe anxiety attacks. Conan was the only thing I could watch but now that the show has come to an end, I can't find anything that helps calm me down. If anyone has suggestions on audio/visual content that helps them calm down, I'd be grateful. Thanks!"
Anxiety,"My mind is all over the place and my exams are coming which has been rescheduled after an initial postponement due to COVID. I don’t recall anything, time is too short and whenever I try to study my mind just shatters in all directions going after various things useless and useful.","I, as a result, keep on fidgeting with my fingers(This is the anxiety that I am suffering from now and I don’t know what kind of an anxiety this is cuz it’s not that hard to bear but you get tired eventually.) and now I just feel like turning into ashes and the wind blows me away(What am I even saying 😅)."
Anxiety,What’s the most irrational fear you have ever had?,"My GAD/OCD make me believe that my crazy irrational fears are actually real, even though deep down I know they aren’t. Just curious what other people’s irrational fears are..."
Anxiety,Don't you fucking dare give me that philosophical shit in the comments.,"I see a lot of people here asking one common question which is - WHY ME. Why do I have to face all the bad luck while others lead a happy life. 

The answer is very simple if you're willing to understand - FUCK PEOPLE. IT HAS TO BE YOU OVER ANYONE ELSE (INCLUDING YOUR PARENTS). please stop living your life as per societal norms and some karmic shit. 

If someone does bad to you, reciprocate even harder so that they know who they messed with. 
If someone does good to you, good for you. Don't carry this baggage that you've to be nice to them for the rest of your life. 

Start fucking with emotions, your own and of people around you. The moment you stop giving a fuck about what your heart wants you'll be at peace. TRUST ME. 

Be practical. Let this be a give and take thing. Start seeing people and relationships as one time fixed contracts. When you're done with them, leave. Stop giving fucks about how they would feel and shit like that. Start using people if you want to be happy. You're not here to be a spiritual guide lmao. 

Start living your life and fucking with people's lives."
Anxiety,Anxiety about moving out for school,"I got accepted to my dream school which is about an hour away maximum and with no traffic, around 30 minutes. I am going to be dorming the first year since I have in-person classes. The reason I have so much anxiety is that I'm really close to my family. Dont get me wrong, I would love to move out become independent and enjoy the freedom and make memories and build experience but I have severe attachment issues and my family is everything to me. It's not like I'm moving across the country or the world, I'm only gonna be 30min-1hour away which isn't a lot. Why am I feeling this anxiety and how can I overcome this anxiety and the potential homesickness?"
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"Multiple hours ago I was so extremely dizzy but I felt like I was forcibly being pushed down, like when I would try to move my head up there was this heavy pressure that felt like someone was pushing me down at all times, I was extremely nauseas, I threw up more then once. I also haven’t eaten in a couple days bc I’ve been so anxious the last 2 weeks and every time I would eat I would get heart palpitations which would make my anxiety worse. I was just wanting to know if these symptoms were just from anxiety or something else? My calf muscles are also twitching for some reason, I can feel it move by itself and just everything happening to me is so scary. I don’t know how to get through this. I’m on day 4 of Zoloft 50 mg, haven’t took it yet since its 3am (I can’t sleep) but I might of threw up my medicine yesterday so I don’t know if I even got day 3 done. This is the worst time of my life."

Anxiety,First post,"

Hello all. I’ve never posted on here before because I’ve been doing decent keeping my mental health in check . The past couple of months however has been really rough for me . I have a material item I won’t name that keeps giving me issues and I keep having to get it fixed / replaced . This item is very important to me and brings me a lot of joy so spending so much time without it /fear of it not being fixed is giving me a lot of added anxiety and depression and just plain sadness. I’ve been doing my best to cope but it’s getting really hard and I spend most days now doing virtually nothing , drinking , feeling very upset . Thanks for listening Reddit"
Anxiety,Is there a way to fall asleep without allowing my anxiety to run wild?,"Is there a way to stop the constant racing of thoughts? Like, there has to be a leash for anxiety, righy? These thoughts are so time consuming that gets in the way of my daily living. Lately it will trigger nightmares and I am unable to properly control it. I can't even articulated well enough to my love ones without being frustrated or saying things out of spite.

I just want to be able to sleep without worrying over ever little thing. I feel like the only way I get rest is to exhaust myself, but I don't want to wait three days of pure anxiety to put me to bed. Any advice or tips are appreciated!"

Anxiety,Meeting my friends today,"Hi hope everyone’s having a nice day, I’ve been suffering from anxiety for roughly 5 years now, but every time my anxiety hits I will 90% of the time will puke, which happened today...

And I’m supposed to be meeting my friends and going to the movies later but I feel bad if I cancel on them because this situation happens quite often. Today I really don’t feel like going out and I just want to rest.

Now I don’t know what to say to my friends coz my anxiety just sounds like an excuse on not meeting them, what should I say?"
Anxiety,Battling anxiety is exhausting,"First thing first: sorry if some things aren’t well said, english isn’t my first language. 

Sometimes, I feel like giving up. Everything is hard even taking my meds. I am diagnosed with General anxiety disorder, depression and hypochondria.

I constantly fall in vicious circles I can’t seem to be able to get out of. I get depressed and cant find the motivation to do shit; I get anxious because i’m not doing anything and get’s behind on many things, then it becomes over whelming and I get depressed again because I feel like im an useless human being.

I’ve been in therapy for 6 months. Once a week. Im also on Zoloft. Well im supposed to be. Apparently I’m too stupid to take them. I take them for a month, then I stop, etc. 

At this point I know it’s my own fault. But it’s just hard. On top of that I’m always convinced I’m dying of a new disease every week. Its obsessive. I spend hours searching symptoms.

Its keeping me from actually living. Im so tired. I dont know what to do anymore."
Anxiety,Seeing “signs”,"Anyone else feel like the more they convince themselves they’re gonna die or have some fatal illness, the more they see mention of the idea of death or said illness everywhere? For example, whenever I start to convince myself I have cancer or something, for days I’ll just notice an increase in videos about cancer on the internet, or even notice people around me mentioning it. It only increases my anxiety because my irrational brain takes it as conformation, or like a sort of “sign” of my impending death. Is this a common thing to experience? I know the brain tends to see whatever it’s looking for, but sometimes it’s a little scary. I’m not superstitious or anything, just seems really ominous."

Anxiety,I don’t feel normal anymore. Nothing is the same like it used to be. Can’t tell if this is due to anxiety or depression,"Crosspost from r/depression

Hi guys, 19 year old hypochondriac here. I feel like I’m slowly losing myself honestly. I’ll start off on a whim saying that nothing feels normal, everything has changed. I think this is due to the combination of changes in my life, health anxiety, smoking weed, and looking at everything in a new perspective. This “new perspective” is absolutely destroying me. I’m constantly thinking about death and not existing (not like suicidal thoughts AT ALL. Just like a fear of death per se). I’m really worried that I’m on the brink of losing my mind. My first plan of action is to lay off on the weed, then find a therapist for this shit. I feel like this is a common mid-life thing that college kids go through but I don’t know how to label it. I don’t feel like I’m disassociating or anything, I really just feel like I’m looking at everything in this new perspective and I don’t feel like my normal self anymore. I still enjoy doing things like riding my bike, making and playing music, playing video games, etc. But I feel like I’m counting the days down now and not making the days count. I dunno. It’s so hard to explain. Nothing is the same like it used to be, but not in a bad way I guess. Do any of you guys sort of relate? You just miss how you used to feel before?"
Anxiety,Anxiety and guilt,"Today someone cut me off when I was in line for food after I was waiting for at least 30 minutes(local drive thru spot). It was 1 am and at this point I’ve been awake for around 21 hours and the meal I was waiting for was going to be my first time eating this day. I’ve never reacted so poorly to a situation. I flipped them off, I yelled at them. Now I feel so guilty and riddled with anxiety because I feel like I encouraged such a negative situation. I mostly regret it because my boyfriend was there and I feel like I made a potentially dangerous situation for him to be involved in. Long story short, people suck and I just should suck it up because involving myself in negative energy gives me crippling anxiety."
Anxiety,The Jack Shephard (LOST) method: Count to 5 and allow the fear to completely give in. This has helped with my anxiety/panic attacks.,"If any of you are familiar with the show LOST, there’s a scene where Jack guides Kate through feeling fear when something has to be done. 

“Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a sixteen year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after thirteen hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac, shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open and the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I... and the terror was just so crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: one, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.” 

I know it’s silly, because it’s a show for one, and because 5 seconds is not going to make my panic attack go away, but oddly enough, I tried this method and it actually does work for me in situations where I need my anxiety to go away. 

I was driving to see a couple of my friends a few weeks ago when all of the sudden, anxiety attack begins. I could hear my heart beat out of my chest, that impending doom feeling, the nausea, the numbing, the tingling feelings in my chest, the blurry vision, the whole shebang. I pulled over. Now, me a year ago would’ve canceled the whole thing and told my friends I couldn’t come. I’m the queen of flaking because of my anxiety and they were used to it anyway, but I was sick of this shit. I randomly thought about letting the fear just take over. I just didn’t care anymore. I felt so fed up with anxiety. I was mad. 

Instead of counting to 5, I counted to 10. Slowly. For 10 seconds I said, Eff this shit. Let it do whatever. Let it give me a heart attack! Let it hurt me! Whatever. I’m over it. For 10 seconds I didn’t think of a damn thing. I simply let the anger and the feelings consume me. I wanted to feel every bit of the fear. I invited the fear in. I just felt like this time, I’ll be angry and I’ll let anxiety rear its ugly head on me randomly. I will allow it. 

I opened my eyes and realized I was clenching my fists so hard it was leaving nail imprints. I thought about texting my friends. I thought about writing the words “sorry guys I am not feeling good today... feel super sick.” I thought about it. But there’s something empowering about being in control and letting the anxiety come. Like no, anxiety, you’re not attacking me randomly because you felt like it. I fucking ALLOWED you to attack. I’m in control here. Not you.

Maybe calling it Jack Shepard method sorta limits its reach, but I highly recommend anyone who can relate to try this. I’m a total hypochondriac also, so I always assume I’m dying. I’m just sick of feeling like I’m not in control. This method has helped me feel like I call the shots. It’s still scary but it feels more liberating when I overcome it."
Anxiety,Finally got a job after so long!,"At the start of last year my anxiety took a huge toll on my mental and physical health. I ended up quitting my job at KFC and leaving University. I became super depressed and stayed home all day smoking weed and just feeling like shit.

This year however, 17 months later I’ve recovered enough to hop back into life. I scored a job at a warehouse and was let back in to University. I’m still kind of scared but at the same time I’m so happy and grateful that I was able to get stronger and move forwards. 

Guys keep at it. Keep moving forward. I was able to reach this point from the brink of suicide. Sending good vibes and peace 😁✌️"
Anxiety,Anxiety about moving out of my parents house - advice???,"I lived on my own when I was 18 for about a year. At first it was terrifying and I hated it, but then I enjoyed my freedom and liked it. During this time I went through something awful and developed PTSD. I ended up with crippling anxiety and decided to move back home. I thought that this would be temporary but I never made enough money to afford an apartment while going to school (I live in an expensive city). Anyways, now I’m starting grad school (23 now), I have money saved, and the school also gave me money to pay rent. On one hand, I’m excited for something new, yet on the other, I do not feel like my mental problems are entirely resolved. I still have a lot of anxiety and it becomes exacerbated when I’m in new situations. I will potentially be moving in with a stranger by next month and I’m terrified. She has no idea I struggle with anxiety so I feel like I’m going to have to hide this side of myself. I’m also just worried about becoming isolated. It’s a big city and very intimidating. I don’t know if I’m jumping into things too quickly or if I will be able to handle it. I could postpone the move for 3 more months but I’m also not sure what good that would do me.  

Has anyone had anxiety about moving out, and how was it once you did it? Do you have any advice/recommendations?"
Anxiety,“Hangover” feeling after pulling an (almost) all nighter for uni,"
Due to my unmatched procrastination skills, yesterday I had no choice but to spend 13 hours speed writing my graduation project for uni. I wrote from 1pm until 5pm, then sat again at 8pm until 5am. 

It’s now 1pm where I live, I woke up about an hour ago and I feel like crap. My anxiety is quite physical, so now I have that weird, distinct, almost nauseous feeling in my stomach. I also feel tired (but not “I want to sleep” kind of tired) and super moody and irritable. 

Anyone else has experienced something similar? Please, if you have any advice on how to feel better, share with me. I’ll appreciate it a lot."

Anxiety,33 year old mom with driving anxiety - feeling hopeless,"Looking for some guidance/support. I’m really struggling with the choices and boxes I have trapped myself into. All because I’ve been too anxious to drive. i have never had a license. Never driven alone. I need to learn but it feels so impossible at this point.

I remember studying the drivers ed handbooks at 12 because I just knew I’d need more time and have to practice so much more than others. By the time I got to driving class in high school I sat out the entire time because I was too terrified to drive in front of classmates and with a teacher. I practiced a few times with my parents but for some reason stopped. I got rides with my friends all the time. Then my boyfriend and I got serious and I just rode everywhere with him. Suddenly I’m 33, have 4 kids, and still have relied on him for absolutely everything in terms of transportation. It’s created an unhealthy dynamic between us, and my kids have definitely suffered because of things I haven’t been able to take them to, sign them up for, etc. Right now I’m struggling with signing one up for preschool because I don’t know how I’ll be able to get him there.

I hate it so much. But it is so overwhelming. Now that I have the kids it’s even harder. Scheduling time, bringing them all along to practice with me... The thought of driving with them in the car adds another terrifying level to the whole thing but I can’t hire a babysitter every time I need to practice. There are too many other variables for that. I don’t live somewhere that offers driving school. To even take the driving exam for my license I’d have to fly to a different city. Which of course adds the pressure because lord what if I fail and just paid for 6 people to fly back and forth because of it? I’m so mad at myself for not learning before I had children.

Last year I made a big effort to get a move on this, I went and got my permit at 32 years old. We practiced a lot in empty parking lots. I never got better at parking. Always wide turns. I never felt comfortable being in control of a huge piece of machinery.  I know in an emergency I’d easily make the worst possible decision. I don’t trust which pedal is the brake or the gas. I feel like I’m going to press the wrong one. I feel like I can’t see around me well enough and I’m terrified of hitting a person. 

I used to have a ton of generalized/social anxiety as a teenager but I have completely overcome that! I honestly don’t feel very anxious or depressed about any other aspect of my life. I hate what a block this particular hurdle is for me. I don’t know what to do. I’m currently trying to practice again but I can’t do it alone and trying to schedule time with my husband working and four kids is....not happening easily. Time just keeps passing and I have made no progress. I feel like I trapped myself and I’m so ashamed and feel so guilty for not providing my kids with this basic option. I barely leave my neighborhood. My parents visited this last month and it was so exciting that I got to go into the grocery store since they could watch the kids. I don’t want to live like this but I don’t know what to do. I’m okay during the day but then at night I remember all I am missing and how bad this could be in an emergency. What if a child gets sick at school and I can’t get a hold of my husband at work to get them? What would I do? Just… so many things I need to drive for. I feel so helpless and ashamed."
Anxiety,"Working on my Master Thesis, and missing firends reception after defence.","  

So, my first time posting, so I am not really sure what can serve as a trigger, so hope this will not include any.

I am diagnosed with the personality disorder Boderline, which means that I get more easily stressed, and have mood swings (and some other non-relevant stuff).

I have had anxiety attacks since I was a child, and sadly back then it came as violent outbursts, luckily I have my anger under control now!

I recently started having anxiety for almost entire days. It feels like there is a pain in my chest, and that it is hard to breath, even though I know there is nothing physically wrong, when it is really bad, I also start to shake. I have a feeling of wanting/needing to cry but can’t most of the time.

It has become really bad since I started working on my master thesis, the symptoms sometimes start from the moment I wake up, so even before I start working on it. I have started on medication and see a therapist sometimes, but it is a slow progress.

This of course makes it really hard to work on my thesis, and it makes me feel guilty, lazy and a bunch of other stuff, which of course only makes my anxiety even worse!

One of my friends who is a student from another country is defending her thesis tomorrow, and she is going to hold her reception outside. This would be fine except I have really bad allergies this year, which means that I can’t even open my windows. Not being able to attend makes me feel like a bad friend, which also makes me feel guilty, and also triggered my anxiety.

So, this post for me is both an outlet and a question, do any of you have any advice to how I can feel less guilty? Because I am really tired of constantly being mad at myself and disappointed."

What if she thinks I'm weird if I message her after ~4 years of not talking? And in the midst of thinking all of that I accidentally hit send. She hasn't seen it yet it's been 43 minutes. I haven't unsent the message yet because I want to prove to myself that I'm not a little bitch who's scared of everything."

Anxiety,"The paradox: the more I learn, collect knowledge or meet people, the less I know about the world and it makes me aware how stupid I actually am","Living unaware of how the actual world works is such a blessing.

The more knowledge I get, the less I get comfortable and calm. When I go outside, collect knowledge, learn new things and I'm getting proud of it, there's always a person smarter or doing better. There's always more knowledge to get, more things to do, more experiences to get.

I like to learn about anything. When I start it's amazing, I'm interested and things are going well untill I start to see how many things are left to get to know and how many people are better than I am. It's frustrating. I start many things but never complete and get anxious.

I compare my intelligence to many people on a daily basis. I think that everyone is smarter than me, know more things or do better. I'm confident about my looks and anyone can't tell me anything how I look because I know I look good, but my intelligence is questionable. I'm an engineer right now, doing Master's but I feel like a fraud and I shouldn't be here. Comparing to my peers, I'm a though learner, I'm very slowly and my brain can't process knowledge really fast. I'm not autistic, dialectic or anything, it's more of a matter of my anxiousness about my intelligence. Under the stress I shut down and say nothing amongst people, even if we work in pairs at my university. I hate anything connected to checking out my knowledge, any kinds of exams, tests ect.

When I was young, my parents used to tell me how stupid I am and how many things I get wrong. When I pour out my tea for example, that's another reason for my parents to prove how wrong is everything I do and why I can't do good at life. It's sad.


There are still somewhere (for example in Africa) villages of  with people living in tents, under the rocks, without electricity, phones, cars ect. They have no idea who's current President of the USA or how to calculate integers. They hunt, sew, eat, drink, sleep, spend time with family, feed animals, play  How happy those people are? I might say the happiest ones.

The most miserable ones are CEOs of big companies, lawyers, doctors, engineers because they know too much. They've seen too much. They've got too many things to get done. 

Is it only me or do people have the same feelings as me?"

Anxiety,Anxious about upcoming MRI,"CW: Health/Medical topic

So, I had some health problems last year that wound up with me sent to the ER on suspicion of a stroke (persistent scotoma in vision and partial facial droop) where they did a CT scan that came back clear but recommended me to a neurologist who examined me and then wrote up an order for me to get an MRI done with and without contrast on my brain. 

The MRI is scheduled for next week (Monday 7th June) and I'm very anxious about it. Not so much about the results of the scan - it's possible that they'll find white matter lesions that could indicate MS or something similar, but honestly it would just be a relief to find answers for all the weird symptoms I've had for years now that culminated in the ER visit. I'm more just nervous about the MRI itself.

I've had one done before, when my gallbladder imploded, and it was very uncomfortable and loud and, yes, claustrophobic. 45 minutes in a tunnel with banging and screeching noises all around. Most of all, I hate having an IV put in (which I had to have during my ER visit, so I recently recall how much I hated it) which they'll have to do for the contrast dye. And the hospital is an hour's drive away so the whole thing just feels like it's going to suck. I've been trying to take my mind off of it, but I keep looping back around to it, having nightmares, feeling on edge. I just want it to be over. It's not soon enough to be almost done, but not far enough away to not worry about it, you know?

I guess this is more just a vent than anything else. Thanks for listening."

Anxiety,I am excessively dependant on exercise to cope with my Anxiety.,"I have had body issues as a teenager due to mild bullying in school regarding my body shape. They did not fully go away, however, even in my adulthood. During the lockdown (roughly a year ago) I discovered the realm of fitness and became deeply engrossed in it. It became my means of feeling good about myself and staying more in control of things. However, I have been noticing since a while ago that whenever I am unable to exercise (even if it is a genuine reason like sickness, fatigue, etc.) I feel deeply guilty and anxious. Worst part is, all of this anxiety affects me at night, right when I go to bed. How do I cope with this feeling of losing control over my body which I have developed with this practice of exercising ?"
Anxiety,Agoraphobia over leaving your home town?,"I have no problem leaving my house to go for a walk or just to do some errands around town or something, but it's more when I'm leaving town.  Basically, I get really anxious any time I have to leave town for something the next day and I almost always end up having a horrible night.  I just can't stop thinking about planning out every step of my day and cycling through it over and over again in my head.

The silly thing is it's sooo much better if it's just spontaneous and I leave for something the same day (can't have a bad night if you don't need to sleep, right?)

Part of it is driving.  I'm definitely less anxious if I know I'm getting a ride instead.  I actually enjoy driving, but I get anxious about it nonetheless.

Anxiety,ANXIETY IS A SIGN OF A FAILURE OF EXPRESSING YOUR EMOTIONS,"When one get anxious especially without a reason this is most of the time a sign of a failure of digesting your Emotions especially your aka negative Emotions such as shame, guilt, anger, wishes .. 
Those Emotions have a reason in first place which is to be communicated or digested ( feeling them without any judgement or denying ) .. so basically your Relationship with your Emotions dictate your Psychological health. 

Now let's talk a bit about how shame influence your life and break you into pieces and make you fragmented and depressed .. 

Shame means ( I am wrong ) so there's a self hate going on without your realization, so your body doesn't speak English, the only way it will communicate with you is via Anxiety or a lack of motivation or apathy .. 
The mistake most guys I meet are making is they try to get rid of the anxiety by taking medications or escaping it by keeping themselves busy all the time .. all you're doing here is making your condition worst and it will come back 10 times harder and who knows you may experience a Psychological breakdown, so in my opinion if you're suffering from Anxiety or the conditions I mentioned above you should dive deep into your Emotions and feel them as painful as they are without any identification or dramatization .. the more you welcome those Emotions the more they'll lose their power .. many of you are asking so how do I dive deeply into those scary painful Emotions or Anxiety, there's a process it's called the revealing process .. it has to do with walking the Emotional scale from apathy which is the lowest Emotion until peace which is the highest Emotional level a person could function in .. I hope you guys got some value from this post ;)"
Anxiety,"My boyfriend is a complete optimist, he’s always happy it’s overwhelming","This year I met this guy, we got along great because we are both extroverted, he’s super out going and loves doing different things and is very driven, these are all things that I’ve fallen for in him but over time my anxiety has kinda gotten worse, he’s is a positive push for me to do things to better myself, he’s much older, he’s very understanding and kind, one time I had a panic attack in front of him and now my anxiety associates it with him for some reason, I’m constantly overthinking even tho I’ve always been an over thinker when it comes to relationships, and it doesn’t help just pushes me away. I think the best way to explain what I’m trying to say is, let’s say a short person walked into a room full of tall people, you are going to feel short and down about yourself, it’s kinda similar only it’s with my anxiety like I can’t always be that mentally balanced, if that makes any sense.

A month-ish ago i was in the bus, leaned on my left hand with a hand supporting my chin/head when i randomly noticed my whole chin and bottom lip went numb. Once i got home the numbness in my lip went away but the chin one still persisted. It was mostly on and off, as in if i forgot about it, doing some other stuff like housework i wouldnt notice it was there, but the moment i remembered it it would come back. Tomorrow it was completely gone. 

Yesterday i was at the mall and i noticed that i got some sort of cramp in my left foot and i felt a chill run through the left side of my body and then my left arm went numb. After a bit of time my arm stopped being numb and my chin started numbing again. Tomorrow (today) it started numbing again. 

Then, both times it happened i of course went to google and ran into NCS ( numb chin syndrome ) which in short is a sign of a very deadly form of cancer and most people diagnosed with it die shortly after. Of course i cant help but feel anxious even thought theres a bunch of stuff written on the internet and without professional help i cant know anything for sure. Still im worried. 

Some things i should note are that im overall healthy, Im 20yo and female, slightly overweight but it hasnt caused any problems apart from physical appearance, i havent had any health problems recently or overall, but i did feel a small tiny bump on my left breast that hurts when i press it ( i didnt check it out though because of the whole covid thing). There arent any other symptoms except for ocassional headaches that i never had up until a year ago, but i think thats because of my sleep schedule drastically changing during that year and every few days ( plus the often weather changes).

Hopefully someone could tell me something about this, if its just in my head or maybe i should visit a doctor, although i dont know which one would be the best option. Thanks in advance, hopefully i flared this correctly."
Anxiety,20 y.o. Never had a job. Feeling «excluded».,"For context i’ve been plagued by anxiety most of my youth-years, and am just now getting better.

My years with anxiety has prohibited me from ever getting a job. I was just terrified of ever applying. Now i’m 20, studying at uni and maybe heading into a bad economy. This has increased my anxiety, which i thought was getting better.

I’m anxious for my economy, my future and how people will react when they find out.

Anyone in the same place as me? Any advice?

TL;DR: never had a job, feeling really anxious about it."
Anxiety,Drinking,"I've been going downhill in my life lately with just what I'm doing with myself. And I've been drinking two weeks straight, and wondering if you get, develop pain in ur stomach and diarrhea sometimes"
Anxiety,Anxiety/Depression combo,Wondering how many that deal with anxiety also deal with depression.  I do.  They are intertwined in a way I’ve yet to truly understand.
Anxiety,anyone else really good at “acting”?,"I struggle with moderate to severe everyday anxiety but a lot of people don’t always notice. I used to be really shy but now it’s easy for me to talk and meet new people, even though I’m feeling anxious while I’m doing it. I’ve even had two therapists tell me now that they didn’t fully understand why I was going to therapy at first because I seemed like I was fine. 

It just takes me a while to open up to people, even my relatives tell me that I’m such a chill and easy going person, but the reality is that I’m not far from crying at any moment if a situation doesn’t go the way I expect it to. I’m pretty much using all of my energy to act normal in social situations so people don’t realize I have anxiety. 

Does anyone relate to this? I’ve come to the conclusion that a lot of people with anxiety are just really good at “acting” because you kind of have to in order to function in social situations sometimes. Idk just something I’ve been thinking about lately."
Anxiety,Big anxiety trigger arghhdh,"CW: mention of difficulties w food/ disordered eating

So food has always been a massive coping mechanism for my anxiety and mental health in general. I’ve been working rlly hard to get it more in my own control and not binge/restrict as chaotically as I have been. Tonight I ordered something from McDonald’s on Uber and I was happy I’d been able to feel more comfortable w the content/size. However I got the wrong order and instead I got a medium family pack aaa. It has six burgers, four fries, four drinks and 20 chicken nuggets. It’s the middle of the night so I can’t share it w family, and McDonald’s doesn’t keep well at all. I’ll have the amount of what I would’ve had but at this point I feel sick and the thought of wasting all that food is really just stressing me"
Anxiety,Got rejected again,After 3 rounds of interviews and then a month of waiting I got a rejection notice today. My current job gives me so much anxiety and I’ve been job hunting the past year with no luck. Today’s rejection was really a blow to the stomach. I feel so sad.
Anxiety,Does anyone else have anxiety tics that cause pain?,"I have an intense phobia (methyphobia) that I cope very poorly with in general. One thing that I've developed over the years are a couple ""tics"" that I do in order to avoid a panic attack. If I don't do the tic(s) I feel like something bad is going to happen and I also start to go into a panic attack. One of the tics involves me tensing up and shaking my hand/wrist while I shake my head ""no"". I now have almost constant pain/popping in the hand I tic with :( Does anyone else have any tics that cause them pain? My tics have changed over the last few years, so I'm hoping this will change as well. Though it seems that whenever they change, they get more intense/noticeable :("
Anxiety,Anybody else feel like their eyes go out of focus when you're nervous?,Like my eyes get blurry and i have to try and focus them
Anxiety,Story time of how my Italian class learned that Im a pick me person(I’m probably not lol),"The audio on my phone was acting weird all day and I’ve tried everything to get it to work. During my Italian class I was adjusting the ringer volume bc I heard that could make it work. And it was testing on my ringtone which was FUCKING SASAGEYO FROM ATTACK ON TITAN IF YOU NEVER WATCHED IT JUST LOOK UP THE SONG and everyone was staring at me practically on the verge of tears.

Considering changing my ringtone into something normal and not very ‘pick me’ like it probably is :/"
Anxiety,It’s a bad day.,"Currently having to worry about so many things… we told the apartment there’s either water damage or mold and they want to look at it while we’re at work so I worry about the cats getting out or them not locking the door. I have to worried about getting attacked by a patient at work that’s unfortunately completely unavoidable. And I’m still concerned about the tiny sparkles of light I see and the occasionally grey spot I wake up with at the top of my vision, even though that’s only happened 3 times and the sparkles have decreased in frequency overall but have been happening for a year now. Worried I’m going to wake up blind due to brain damage that I don’t know if I have from car accidents and being hit in the head. Just so worried and there’s nothing I can do because this is all out of my control."
Anxiety,Today I rented and rode electrical scooter also got on a public bus.,"Today I did my exposure therapy. I rented an electrical scoot with credit card. Done the negotitation and rode scooter for half an hour. I also rode public buss using a strangers pass I kindly asked to use her pass and she allowed.

I have OCD, shyness and GAD normally I can’t talk with strangers I feel like muted and also doubt everything a lot I have Pure ocd.

I guess today was a success. I cried after doing all this and it was not easy and felt anxious a lot but I also felt free."
Anxiety,I need to set up a bank account but I’m anxious,I really need to set up a bank account. I was gonna have my mom help me but I kept sleeping in too late now she doesn’t have time off of work to do it so I have to do it alone. I have over $700 to put in the bank but like the act of going to the bank and setting up an account is so scary to me. What if I do the wrong plan or whatever and like I can’t access my money or it takes my money like I don’t even know enough to really express my fears ughhhh
Anxiety,Talking to Clients at Work,"So recently I have been dragged into an external project where we have these daily update calls with the client, and the entire process is daunting. If I don't have a set of written notes, I get nervous and mess up whatever I wish to convey.

And that is pretty much what happened today. A few minutes before the call, my ceo called me up and sort of informed me what all points would I have to speak of, if someone asks me for it. And during the call, he (the ceo) ended up asking something totally different.

I got nervous and since I hadn't worked much on it, I ended up saying that there were no updates. And figured that I shouldn't have said that and started explaining it which made things bad.

And now I feel like I should have faked network issue and not spoken at all. 

I am dreading that I will have to speak with them tomorrow as well."
Anxiety,overcome my driving anxiety,"
so I’m 20 yrs old and I rely on my mom to take me places. I haven’t actually driven since I got my license when I was 17. But it’s actually about to expire soon and I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try and renew it anytime soon bc I don’t have a car and never thought about getting one of my own for a few reasons

1) I don’t go anywhere except for my new job which is only 4 minutes away. 
2) I have a major fear about getting in an accident. 
I don’t know really what to do and I don’t wanna rely on other people but at the same time idk if it’s worth it. I wouldn’t use it except to and from work. And other places only in my city.Idk if it’ll be a pointless purchase. Also like I said I can’t get rid of my big fear of being on the road 😪"
Anxiety,Constantly feeling on edge is exhausting,I'm sorry. I don't usually say stuff like this. but i don't understand why i can't feel relaxed even for five minutes
Anxiety,Celexa and Anxiety,I have had anxiety most of my life and i thought i have been able to deal with it but recently i cannot come back to center.  My GP prescribed celexa 10mg and i have been on it for 6 days.  Does anyone have experience with this?  I feel worse at times. My anxiety just comes on like a vengeance and it is really difficult.  She said it can take 4 weeks to really notice differences but does it get a little better along the way?  She prescribed me Ativan to take if it gets really bad but i do not like taking benzos.  I really appreciate any insight and thank you for you help.
Anxiety,Pin and Needle(Tingling feeling in feet and hands),"Yesterday, my anxiety was up for a few hours early in the morning and it went down by afternoon. But later in the night I started noticing tingling feeling in my feet. My feet are cold but sweaty at the same time. I went to bed and woke up to the same feeling today and it’s moving up to my legs. I’m not having any anxiety rn but I was wondering if this could be caused due to my anxiety early in the morning yesterday or something else like Meds. I never experience this before!"
Anxiety,Buspirone for moderate anxiety?,"Hello! I have GAD and depression. I used to be on SSRI’s but did really poorly with them. I haven’t been on anything for a few years now but my anxiety has been getting pretty rough and Im thinking about going back on something for a short term to get it under control again. I was reading and it seems like buspirone might be nice. Has anyone had any luck with this? From reading threads about it it seems like it does nothing for people with severe anxiety, but I was wondering if anyone with moderate anxiety finds it helpful? (For reference I rarely get panic attacks and am mainly just hoping to stop grinding my teeth, biting my tongue, and having that feeling in my stomach 24/7)"
Anxiety,I can’t tell if I’ve always had it or I got it,"As a kid I had no social anxiety at all and I was so content with everything life offered. I’ve heard stories of how people have had anxiety in some mild form or the other at least as a kid but I remember never having a doubt about any social worries. I was brim with confidence and made friends so easily. Then my teenage years come and I start idolising edgy behaviour to some extent so I caused some damage there but I soon recovered after that. 

Since I’ve been 17 in the last year, I’ve tried to overdose twice and cannot mentally fathom how I will make friends in the future or how anyone can ever truly feel comfortable in a social situation. It’s like it got zapped out of me, all my confidence and what little charm I had had just disappeared into thin air. I don’t know how this is even possible and if it’s possible to ever go back even when my beliefs on this have become so engrained in me"
Anxiety,calling out of work gives me anxiety,I'm very quiet and shy and I found a log my boss keeps of everyone in my department and she reported everyone for various things and some of it contained full on lies about me and my friends? Ever since then I've been calling out because I'm so nervous around her. She's a self proclaimed school bully. I have to go back but what triggers my anxiety the most is being hated by people :(
Anxiety,I’m not very good at my job,"Title kinda gives it away but I’m not good at my job. To be honest I’m not sure I’ll be good at any job. I’m not very detail oriented so I miss small things (typos etc). Lately my mental health has been pretty low with some self worth issues coming up. 

I don’t feel particularly motivated to work. My supervisor is truly a nice person so I feel bad letting her down, bc she actually works quite hard and does a ton of stuff. Today we had our usual check in and she mentioned a few of these issues + making sure to not let things fall between cracks.

She’s right, but I just don’t have passion for my job and can’t seem to bring myself to care. I’ve been working here for a year and a few months. It feels a bit like this will just be my life; I’ll always have trouble with work but have no choice bc I have rent and bills to pay.

It’s not great for my confidence and I wish we lived in a world that cared more about people and less about arbitrary work. (My job is in my opinion not an important one for society).

Does anyone else feel this way too? I can’t be the only mid 20’s person with this dread about doing the 40 hr work week for the rest of my life lol"
Anxiety,My mother's depressed again.,"My mother has bipolar disorder and she's honestly been pretty down for almost 2 months. Today it's really bad and my anxiety is going crazy because I feel like there is something I should be doing. There isn't, I know there's nothing I can do. But it doesn't stop the anxiety from spiking. Also it makes me angry because I never feel like I can be upset because she takes up all the upset space. If I'm sad then she acts like I'm being a burden on her already sad day. It pisses me off, and then I feel guilty for feeling pissed when she's depressed. Anxiety sucks"
Anxiety,When you send a double text,"Before I start: my partner has ADHD so I know that messaging won't be 24/7 type of deal!


So throughout the day after our convo ends I sometimes send something as like a oh thinking about you type of text (meme, something I saw that I wanted to tell him about etc..) but then see that it would be two messages one after another and it makes me feel like I'm annoying him. He told me it doesn't and that's it sweet but I still feel annoying.

 Also doesn't help in the past I have been with partners who once they saw me double text they would on purpose ignore me cuz the messaging was too much/extremely annoying. 


Does this happen with anyone else sometimes? Like you send a double but the messages are hours apart but you still feel like you're annoying someone?"
Anxiety,"My Thesis Defense day is approaching and my anxiety is crippling me, need advice.","So I'm finally almost done with my Master's thesis and about to hand it in and book a day to present. The thing is I have massive public speaking anxiety, and I'm really afraid that I would screw up. I have put over 200 hours into my thesis (and I'm very proud and happy with my work), yet I feel it's unfair that's the 1-hour presentation could affect half of my grade if I'm not good at presenting. I know I could manage throughout the presentation because I did many presentations before and I have got good grades, especially with practice but **my main fear is when they ask me questions about my work, I could really go mute or mumble words that make no sense because of my anxiety**, even if the question is so easy to answer. I had days where I used to skip the first hour of the class so I could avoid simply introducing myself, that's how bad it is. I tried to reach out for the student counseling in my school but unfortunately, she is no longer in the school and there's no successor. My advisor knows about my issue from the previous semester but I'm not sure if I should bring it up to him now, I really don't want him to think that I'm being lazy or weak.

I never took any pills before but I did see a therapist for a while, he has helped me overcome my hypochondriac panic attacks but not the public speaking.  
If anyone’s been in the same situation or feels that they could give me any advice, I would appreciate it!"
Anxiety,kind of a health issue question??,"idk where to post this…

sometimes i have these sudden episodes where my vision starts getting fuzzy, i get nauseated, clammy, and my limbs feel heavy and limp. id say i’ve had about 6 maybe, in the span of ~13 years. the most memorable episodes were 

1. right after i got my gallbladder out- the day after (i was on norco), i took a shower and when i was getting out, i had one of the episodes. i called the ambulance, they took my vitals and said everything was fine, so i didn’t go to the hospital.

2. i got my eyebrow pierced. it was right when i stood up afterwards.

3. today. i’ve actually felt pretty decent lately. i have been taking norco frequently the last few days through. the episode was a little more intense today.

i went to a neurologist about 6 years ago and i’ve been seeing a cardiologist for over a year now. the neurologist did an mri and eeg and said i had one wave that was a little abnormal for my age, but nothing to be concerned about, and dismissed me. the cardiologist had me wear an event monitor for a month which showed one chamber occasionally beating faster than the other, and vice versa. my blood pressure also runs a little low and i started medicine for that last month. i was told all of this is nothing to be concerned about.

i’ve had anxiety issues my whole life. does this sound more mental or physical health related? after i have these episodes, i feel so defeated, anxious, and just off in general. today i’m also cold and shaky since the episode."
Anxiety,Am I mentally slow?,"I have depression and anxiety that I can't handle. I'm 19 years old 
I'm in college in my 2nd year of marketing
I worked as a marketing and sales manager for two years, but I had to quit because of personal problems, from which I still can not recover. Over the past two years, I've started to notice a lot of strange things about myself. However, since early childhood, I have constantly noticed a lot of oddities that do not occur in normal people. But I didn't pay much attention to it, and now I regret it, because my stupidity is only getting worse.

I remember almost nothing, everything goes out of my head, I can hardly remember anything. I think slowly. A normal person gets it from the first or second time, and I only get it from the fifth, or even to the tenth. Of course, it happens to everyone, but it happens to me all the time.  Sometimes I get lost in simple situations. Some things are hard to understand: especially when I need to read instructions at work or hear a speech addressed to me, I can misunderstand and do a bad job.

 When I talk to someone, I often interrupt people. And during the dialogue, I often lose my train of thought and do not have time to force my speech, and my mind wanders elsewhere, even if I am not distracted. In general, it is quite difficult to communicate with people, as I speak very quickly and without thinking. My speech is too fast, and I sometimes speak erratically. I also have poor articulation, and people often find it difficult to understand me. And my speech sounds rather unintelligible and monotonous. Constant problems with finding the right words. I often repeat the same words and sentences during a conversation and speak louder than necessary.

I underwent an MRI and EEG examination: MRI data for organic brain damage and the presence of focal lesions were not detected. The EEG data is the same, there are no deviations from the norm."
Anxiety,Workplace anxiety support group,"I am struggling and it comes in waves with my anxiety. I am wondering if there are support groups for those who suffer from anxiety in the workplace? It’s so hard for me to work and focus, especially during busy times. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
Anxiety,Anxious over propranolol,"So I’ve had panic attacks and Dpdr for 5-6 years now. I tried medication at the start and it made me feel awful. I’ve avoided it for years, thinking just therapy would help, but it’s just getting worse again. The doctor prescribed me some propranolol today and I’m very apprehensive over the side effects, dizziness being the biggest one as it’s a very bad trigger for me (especially the room spinning type of thing). If anyone has any experience they’d like to share I’d love to hear it!"
Anxiety,Breath holds seem to make anxiety attacks milder?,They work better for me than fox breathing or 4-7-8 breathing do. Also breathing in with your diaphragm. Anyone else?
Anxiety,Bananas treat Anxiety?,"I eat a banana and it calms me down, there is something about it....

anyone here try bananas?"
Anxiety,Quitting my job of 5 years today,"I've been miserable working it for the past 5 years but my anxiety has always made me feel trapped. Countless nights I'd hide and just cry away from the rest of my coworkers. Lately my anxiety has become much worse and I had a full blown panic attack a few days ago and ended up calling 911. Thought I was dying. Maybe the most scared I've ever been in my life.

Decided to put my mental health first for once. I have a decent amount of money saved up but no health insurance so the thought of not having a job terrifies me because one medical emergency and there goes my savings. At the same time I feel hope that I can overcome this anxiety that has controlled me for the past 5-6 years of my life. I even took the first step and have an appointment with a therapist next week.

I've always kept my mental health to myself. So just wanted to type this out as a way to get it off my chest. Whoever reads it thank you, and I hope you get through whatever battles you're fighting."
Anxiety,I feel like this must be some kind of anxiety disorder,"Sorry  if the Title is a little weird or confusing. I dont have any sort of  diagnosis or anything but I feel like I might have some kind of anxiety  thing going on.

The short and  simple of it is that I refuse to believe that everyone experiences this  much fear constantly. If everyone does carry around a buzzing knot of  fear in their chest then my respect for pretty much everyone I have ever  met will rise. Even now, in my bed writing this. Not only is that fear  keeping me up, but it is making the process of writing this far more  difficult than it should. It means that I cant talk to other people  about it because I am too scared. I struggle to do basic things just  because. I dont even know why, it all just gets too much and I feel  sick.

I want to stop feeling so  scared. I thought that when I was done with my GCSE exams I would be  calmer because I was done with that stage of school, but Im not, im just  as scared as I was before but now I cant blame School for that fear. I  am now going to post this before I convince myself not to."
Anxiety,I despise driving,"This is more of a rant. I drive to work every single day, but I absolutely hate it. I worry about everything while I'm driving. I monitor my speedometer constantly because I'm worried about going too quickly. I can't focus with music or any unexpected sounds. I hate large intersections, especially left hand turns. Driving just stresses me out beyond belief. I'm a terrible navigator and literally get lost 5 minutes from my own home. On top of that, I will do anything to avoid it. If I have the option to walk on foot, even if my destination is an hour away, I will do so rather than drive a car. It's becoming crippling, my fear of driving. Living in in the suburbs, I need my car to get EVERYWHERE. It's so frustrating, and I feel like I'll never remove myself from this awful routine. Driving makes me so anxious and tense. 

In conclusion, it sucks."
Anxiety,My favorite game to play,"My favorite game to play is why am i sad. I catch myslef on the most ordinary day feeling sad and there are usually a couple different possibilities as to why. Today in particular i could think of a few like: my parent fought today, i haven't been working out lately or i just hate how i present myself to others and feel like they don't like me. I don't know which one it is yet, it could also be a combination of all three. I don't know. My mother said that i shouldn't feel sad when they fight because it shouldn't affect me but i still catch myself feeling down after every time i hear them fight. I don't know why i just can't control how i feel about that. However If the reason of my saddnes is not working out lately than i think I'm weak and should not feel sad after not getting dopamine from pointless little exercises because that means that i am dependent on working out just so i could feel normal. The last possible reason is something i have been struggling with for the majority of my teen years and i feel like i have improved but today i didn't at all like how i was acting."
Anxiety,I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience. But it only keeps getting worse for me. The racing thoughts are ceaseless. 

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both. 

I've been looking for other jobs the past two years and haven't been able to find anything. I will be moving back home and living off of unemployment for as long as I can. Hopefully I can find something else soon."
Anxiety,Can you give me a few minutes,"If you are like me, you feel you’re a castaway on a desert island.  Only your desert island is in your head and you’re sitting in your kitchen, or laying in bed or talking yourself into getting out of your chair to do something, anything. Anxiety is paralyzing and lonely. We want to scream from the top of our lungs “does anyone see me?”  “HELLO, I’m right here…!”  

We think to ourselves, shouldn’t the people who know me, know this particular week, for whatever particular reason is so very hard for me?  Am I really so hidden that it doesn’t occur to anyone to check in?  People know I have anxiety. People know I’m ultra sensitive to my children’s needs and emotions.  People who should know you well; should know that this particular week, for whatever particular reason is hard. 

I see you.  I hear your thoughts. I know the emotions, or lack there of.  We think to ourselves, do I really have to pay someone every other week to hear those thoughts out loud or ask those questions?  

If you’re reading this and you are not one of the millions afflicted with anxiety, I ask you to consider. To really read what I’m writing.  Ask your friends. How are you?  How are you holding up this week, this hour, this minute?  Things that don’t necessarily trigger anything in you, could be triggering something deep in someone else.

I have a child who is going through a major milestone this week. His last of some things, his first in many more.  But you know what I’m feeling the most?  The lasts…I’m trying very hard not to get caught up in this, but it’s coming at me hard. And fast. And I’m trying to keep my head above water because I don’t have the luxury of sinking…the last’s mean I’m losing control slowly.  My ability to protect. And defend…

I feel for you.  I know your worried. And anxious. And scared. So am I. The things I start to lose control of mean I have to trust this world to keep him safe. I have to trust him to make the right choices. One wrong choice…and downward I go.  “Try to look at the positives” everyone says…well, that’s not now I operate. I know this world sucks, I know more and more that there are shitty people out there.  I know the minute I don’t see all the dangers, the dangers will show up one by one. That’s how it works right?  If you spent one minute ignoring would go could wrong, it most certainly will, and you’ll be left unprepared.  

I see you. I hear your thoughts echoing around inside your mind.  Just know you’re not alone. Just know it’s ok to live to breath deep until the next minute. To hold back tears the next hour.  To just try to make it through this week.  

Hey my friend…How are you?  Do you need to talk?  

Please consider those few acts of kindness and an hour out of your week to help your anxious friends though whatever challenge is before them."
Anxiety,Anyone with anxiety experience really bad headaches that won't go away,"I have been to er 5 times in 2 weeks for headaches and feel worse when I Ben forward and also feel like I will faint and pass out . I had a CT scans two months ago and it was normal, and blood tests were fine, doctor told me unlikely I have anything serious since a CT scan was done just two months ago and a MRI 16 months ago..I feel a pain more when bending forward and also experience tremors with it and weak feeling in arm and legs feel wobbly"
Anxiety,All day.,"Currently, I am waiting for my blood test results to come back in. I’m a huge hypochondriac so of course this has my anxiety spiking to the max. I am on edge, my chest is super tight, weird head fog, I feel like I’m on fire along with the heart palpitations. The only relief I get is when I burp, oddly enough. I cried for a good portion of the morning which felt relieving at the time but now I feel like I’m being made to pay for it. I have been anxious all day, having attacks and on absolutely edge for over a week now and I cannot seem to shake it. I feel like I’m vibrating from the inside out and sometimes it’ll get so bad I’ll start violently shaking. I just wish this would stop. This is not any way to live."
Anxiety,My therapist stated something so obvious I can't believe I didn't realize it,"Basically, I hate my part time job. It gives me massive anxiety and I straight up don't like it. I was talking to her, trying to figure out why I have so much work anxiety, and she just says ""why are you still working there? You don't like it, so why have you been there so long?"" 

It seems obvious that since I dislike the job so much I would've quit a long time ago, but I've always been under the impression that you don't have to like your part time job, you just have to do it. That's the way my family talks about it, so I just thought I had to power through. I also assumed a therapist would tell me to just stick it out and not to run away from my anxiety, but she also said that not every job is right for every person.  It's obvious this isn't the right job for me, so why am I forcing myself to go?

So I'm putting in my two weeks today, on to something better hopefully"
Anxiety,A question for any Therapist who may be on here.,"&amp;#x200B;

How can one pinpoint when cognitively if someone is experiencing paranoia? 

I have had a few episodes where it felt more than anxiety. Almost as if someone was watching me. That eerie feeling.

I know it sounds insane but I don't really have anyone else to ask at this moment."
Anxiety,I’m so fragile these days that someone asking me how I am brings me to tears,"I’ve had anxiety since I was a child. I’m someone who would be considered “high functioning”. Always an overachiever, self critical, filling up all of my free time with things because I beat myself up for being “unproductive” if I have nothing to do. I put so much pressure and unrealistic expectations on myself. I always focus on the thoughts and feelings of others, and don’t take care of my own emotional needs. 

At work, I’ve only ever gotten excellent feedback. I even recently got promoted. Instead of feeling worthy of the promotion, I tell myself this is all temporary and my new boss is going to realize that I’m not as great as he originally thought when he recruited me to join his team. 

I’ve been in denial for so long about my anxiety. Constantly staying busy so I don’t have to think about it. I had some bad digestion issues last summer. A $1500 colonoscopy and endoscopy later, turns out there’s nothing medically wrong with me. I’m convinced it’s my stress and anxiety that was doing it. 

I smoke weed the second I’m done with work because that’s the only way I can stop my brain and that’s the only way I can sleep. 

I always try to be a rock for everyone else but I’m on the verge of breaking. I present myself as someone who has their shit together because I don’t want anyone to know how much I hate myself inside. It takes one person showing the slightest bit of kindness, or even asking me how I am for me to fight the tears. Only my closest family know I have bad anxiety, and even they don’t know the extent I beat myself up. 

I’m so tired of living this way. I want to enjoy my life and not feel this massive sense of anxiety and guilt constantly."
Anxiety,How do you deal with fear of change?,I worry I'll panic about the change and won't be able to stop until the change go back to how it was before.
Anxiety,Prozac? Just prescribed and I'm feeling scared.,"33F,  recently prescribed prozac.. mood swings, manic episodes, bipolar, severe anxiety, insomnia, pretty sure deep rooted depression..I have dealt with a few different traumatic episodes throughout my life; the most recent being August '20.

I haven't taken meds up until this point because they honestly terrify me, but I'm at a point where these issues are affecting my quality of life immensely. I tried Lexapro for panic attacks about ten years ago and it really messed me up. 

I struggle with Systemic Lupus and feel like those meds don't help..

I guess what I'm getting at is:
-What was the adjustment like into taking medication?
-Were there any issues that would effect my quality of life even more?
- I work a very mentally demanding job during the days and a brewery gig some nights of the week.. is the transition going to effect my ability to do so?
-I hate to use such a vague term, but did starting this medication make the individual feel ""weird""?
-Does this medication help with motivation and interest in doing things again?
-As far as decrease in libido..how extreme is it? That's one of the only fun things I've got going for me lately.

Thanks for any future advice/responses."
Anxiety,What kind of summer jobs can people with anxiety apply for?,"I'm a 17 yr old rising college sophomore looking for work for the summer. I applied to work at Joann's since the store is always empty and quiet, but they never called me back 😔. My ideal part time job would be one where I work with animals, but all of them require me to be 18, even dog walking. 

Im trying my best to avoid restaurants since _I dont want to be paid a slave wage_ managers are usually bad there and landscaping/construction since I know Ill pass out. I just applied for some stocking jobs in some crowded stores, so if I get the job, Im not sure if Ill show up.

Does anyone have any ideas of chains or other jobs I could try to apply for? Small businesses in my area tend to practice _racism_ cronyism and nepotism, so Im not sure if theyll hire me."
Anxiety,Wellbutrin,"So doc just raised me to 300XL from 150Xl after 5 weeks. Note that I take this for anxiety/panic and depression brought on by it. In the past 150 has done wonders for me. On 150XL at week 5 this time however, my anxiety has shot through the roof. Doc seems to think that my symptoms are ""breaking through' the 150 and the 300 may take care of it. However judging by the posts I've seen in this group, I'm inclined to believe she's full of shit. Has ANYONE experienced success or a drop in their anxiety/panic at 300XL. Personally speaking I've had it with medical professionals using me as a damn lab rat. Suggested a combo of zoloft and wellbutrin, ""welloft"" as I've seen jt called, but sue didn't seem interested in adding another medicine as that would cause other side effects

At this point I could give a shit about side effects, I just want to feel well."
Anxiety,Buspar medication (Buspirone),"I’ve just been prescribed 10MG of Buspar 2x per day for my generalized anxiety. I’ve struggled with anxiety most of my life, and I also do experience depression at times. I’ve been worried about starting medication/if Buspar is the right one for me.... does anyone have any advice or willing to share your experiences? 

Additionally, is there another sub Reddit that is more active with Buspar discussions? I noticed the “Buspar online” one isn’t very active and I was hoping to find a discussion group somewhere for support.

Any advice would be really greatly appreciated."

Anxiety,Panic Disorder numbness/tingling,"Hello I've been having severe physical reactions to anxiety for about 2 years now and getting medical help while unemployed where I live has been a challenge so I just thought I'd talk about a few of my symptoms to see if anyone else has experienced this.

It first happened when I was working a stressful job. Started getting headaches, sweating abnormally, and getting nauseous. Then one day I was riding with my dad to swing thru a drive thru and get food but on the way I started getting REALLY hot, dizzy, nauseous, and almost felt like I was going to pass out. Then I noticed my hands were tingling. This lasted for about 10-15 minutes then I went back to normal. Freaked me out so I went to get checked out with my doctor who of course really didn't have any answers. A few weeks pass and then while I was playing games on my PC I started to feel bad again the same way I did in the car. This time however my hands went beyond tingling to completely numb. The numbness then started to spread through my arms and my chest and finally my face. My dad called an ambulance for me since we both had no idea what was going on. On the way to the ER in the ambulance my face started twitching real bad and mouth even puckered up so bad I couldn't speak correctly. I was admitted there for 2 days and a doctor finally suggested I had a panic disorder. 

My first reaction to this was skeptical because of how severe the physical symptoms were. I started trying to piece all the information of my situation together like a puzzle best I could and eventually settled on the fact that it was actually just anxiety.

So I made an appointment with a psychiatrist and got on some meds one of them being a benzo. The benzo always stopped the attacks within minutes and I was careful to only use them when my hands started to tingle. Only needed them a few times over about 2 months and stopped taking anything. Fast forward 8 months later and I had another attack while out of town and had to cancel my trip early to come back home. 

Now every time I have to leave the house basically my stomach start turning and I get worried I might have an attack again. The numbness is so overpowering its had a pretty severe impact on my quality of life.

So I guess I'm just curious how common this numbness sensation is and what can be done about it. How long it lasts. Will it ever stop? How bad is it getting on an SSRI?"
Anxiety,Ativan as needed,Hi anyone take Ativan as needed and only as needed? I have only taken 1mg as needed since November of last year it’s the only thing that helps me on my bad days I’m great full that I am responsible for them as I know a lot become dependent on them. I’m very sensitive to ssri’s so doctor doesn’t give them to me anymore as that’s why I have the Ativan. I feel it gets a bad rep for those of us that use the correctly. Anyone in the same boat as me ?
Anxiety,Challenge Wednesday,So I mad plans to go to the movie theater with my best friend today. I’m kinda worried and anxious about it.

Anxiety,White noise addiction,Can anyone else relate? I know it’s weird but i have it playing off YouTube whenever I’m indoors no matter what time of day. the only time I’m not listening to it is when I leave the house  or I’m at work but even then I’ve had it playing through my headphones before (although this isn’t often) I just feel like it’s the only thing that makes me feel calm and relaxed and helps me a bit with the anxiety. When I sleep il have it playing off the TV and then a tower fan running next to me. I will have several different devices going off at the same time with different sounds going on if I’m struggling to fall asleep. Yeah I probably sound crazy
Anxiety,Most random cause of anxiety ever..,"I have been in an anxiety whirlwind for the past week over purchasing my first home. We went through hell to get to closing but we finally made it, and my initial feeling was relief. Then it sunk in that I made a huge financial commitment and the house wasn’t perfect. I like the inside, but it needs a lot of work on the grounds. And then my mind says “you don’t have enough money to fix this” “you screwed up” the usual greatest hits. Anyone else go through this when they bought a home?"
Anxiety,Increased anxiety with Wellbutrin SR 100mg,"For those who had an increase of anxiety as a side effect of Wellbutrin, how did you cope with it?

I have tried this medication for 1 month with the XL formula (150 mg) and it did wonders for energy, mood and libido. The problem is that I had to stop because the anxiety had gotten so much worse. 

Now I am giving a second try with 100mg of SR. I can already feel more anxious. 

What are your experiences? Did it settle down over time? Has a combination of medication counteract the anxiety side effects or did you have to completely stop?

I also take Abilify 2.5mg and Escitalopram 12.5mg."

Anxiety,My anxiety is stopping me from accomplishing anything in my life. Help me please!!,"Although stated in the title I’ll say it again my anxiety is stopping me from accomplishing any of my future plans. I plan to become a welding inspector in the future, but I still need to finish a couple of more courses before I can actually become one. That being said my anxiety has seriously affected my comprehension skills( trouble understanding verbal instructions is basically what I’m trying to say). I sometimes tell the people that are explaining things to me that I understand what there trying to tell me when really I don’t. I do this because I fear that people will think I’m stupid for asking twice or even asking a third time in repeating what they said. Anyways these issues give me really bad anxiety and fear that I could actually end up hurting someone because of a mistake that could happen on my behalf. I also plan on getting a job in a tire shop in the meanwhile but again the thought of me working on peoples car and realizing that I could seriously hurt someone by forgetting to tighten a lug nut for example scares me to death and stops me from even trying to apply. With that being said I feel like if I make smart decisions in these specific situations I won’t hurt anybody, but still the fear I get from thinking that I could seriously hurt someone stops me from even trying to do these things. Anyways sorry for the bad grammar. Any advice on a way to stop letting my anxiety stop me from accomplishing my goals."

Anxiety,Fear of Driving,"I got my driver’s license around two years ago but I still can’t drive independently and it makes me extremely anxious. 

I’m at an age where not being able to drive myself around is really affecting me- in terms of getting to work, meeting up with friends etc 
But I’m unable to do anything about it. 
A few months ago, I built up the courage to drive alone (without my dad, who usually accompanies me) I kept panicking the whole time and at one point, I accelerated instead of braking and ended up hitting these barriers (fortunately, no one was hurt) but the incident completely shattered my confidence. 


I live in a big city with lots of cars and traffic and I feel like that’s a factor which discourages me even more.

I find that I can’t focus and concentrate on anything. This may not make sense but my main concern and fear revolves around my eyes. I find them to be the most anxious part of my body I can no longer go out to the shops see friends or family because of this “fear” in my eyes. I find them to be twitching, widening and moving uncontrollably when making eye contact or going out in public heck even when I’m sitting here doing nothing :/ its a feeling I can’t explain sounds stupid really lol I’ve been to doctors, psychologists you name it. Tried mediation eating healthy, exercise I have literally exhausted my options and yeah meds made it worse had to wean off them a while ago.

Anxiety,My GF's anxiety is getting worse. What can I do to help her?,"My girlfriend of nearly 4 years has always suffered from some kind of anxiety, and she did seek professional help for it once at the start of the pandemic. Things had been getting better but recently certain things are triggering a deluge of self hatred and anxiety. Her (perceived) weight, her career, and today - driving. She hasn't driven in 5 years or more but she feels bad that I do all the driving. She's filled with dread at driving and filled with dread at not driving. Psyches herself up to come with me for a test drive then descends into a wreck when she bails. 

What should I do? Encourage her to see a doctor again? Would overcoming this fear of driving give her a boost of self confidence?"
Anxiety,I failed my treatment plan and I'm scared to go back to the doctor,"A few months ago, I finally decided to go on a mental health plan. The doctor was super sweet. She started me on lexapro and gave me a referral for a psychiatrist. I was really excited. Well I stayed on the lexapro for about 3 weeks and then my shiftwork kept fucking with my schedule so much (on and off nightshifts) and I forgot when I had and hadn't taken it because I suffer from a lot of short term memory loss. And eventually I gave up because I thought it was useless to keep trying. I hadn't even used the referral for therapy because I was so nervous about having to call around clinics as many are booked out for months these days and I was too exhausted from work to bother, anyway.

I switched jobs to something less physically and mentally taxing which at first I thought was helping. I'm on a proper schedule now, too. But my anxiety is just manifesting in different ways. My paranoia has gotten so much worse. I keep second guessing myself and my own intentions, and I feel like my only close friends are plotting against me all the time. I keep playing the 'are my emotions valid and real or am I just overreacting?' game, and internalising everything. And now that I'm not constantly thinking and worrying about work, my ADHD feels worse too and I can't relax or keep myself occupied at home. I can hardly focus on my favourite video games.

I'm so embarassed to try and see the doctor again. This is the second time I will have failed on taking meds in the last couple years. Every time I forget to do a simple task or put something down and misplace it for the billionth time that day I just want to scream. I want to curl up into a ball and cry until I disappear. It feels like it's pointless to try and I'm never going to get better."

Anxiety,Unwanted thoughts that make me feel overwhelmed and that my whole world is crashing and burning??,"Hey guys!

I've suffered from debilitating panic attacks in the last couple of years, which are way better now but about one month ago I started to get anxious thoughts, which i've never struggled with the whole time I was having panic attacks.

Basically, I get thoughts/feelings that I feel 'overwhelmed' and I can't handle anything. They make me feel scared like i'm going to lose my sh\*\*t. I don't know how to make them stop. 

I've moved to a new city and safe to say i'm not loving it, and i've also made 0 friends. 

I don't want to go on medication. I also can't afford psychologist appointments. :(

I want to try every natural thing that could help combat these thoughts, and I would love to hear what you guys have done. 

Thanks!"
Anxiety,"[Rant]Whenever I get stressed, emotional or perform physical activities, my body starts to feel tingling, burning sensations and pain/numbness crawling all over the upper part of my body.","Hey guys , I'm currently 23 and this has been happening to my life everyday for the past 4-5 years. 

Whenever I get stressed, emotional or do something physical ( can be walking ,running, hopping , carrying stuff or as little as just changing bedsheets) , my body immediately heats up/ itches and I can feel thousands of pin and needles crawling under my skin , and the only temporary solution to this is using water(or a water spray in outdoor) to relief it. This has seriously impacted my life and I have no control of it whatsoever, the symptoms can also last from 5minutes to an hour , but usually staying still+water does the job , however this is not a long term solution and i'm not so sure what to do.

I have once visited a dermatologist but my skin looked fine to him ,and the anti-allergic medicine he gave me (Labixten) doesn't really help either. I also had a full body scan an year ago but all my internal organs looked healthy and normal)

Note: it only affects my body partially ( mainly scalps , forehead, under my chin, back of my neck, Upper torso) , the lower part of my body never had these symptoms) . Swimming is also the only physical activity I can do normally.

Any helps or suggestions are greatly appreciated"

Anxiety,Does anyone else experience intrusive thoughts messing with their memory?,"Sometimes I have really horrid intrusive thoughts that make me feel sick. I know rationally that they're things I'd never do and never reasonably even come close to considering, but sometimes if I'm in a particularly bad anxiety vortex I'll start tracing them onto hazy memories. They'll be things from years ago that I barely remember anyway, and then I'll start to panic and think that I have committed these awful deeds at some point even though the thought disgusts me. It's been happening more recently, and I keep worrying that I've hurt people I don't know anymore, or that I'm a monster because my memory is completely shot and all I've got to go on are these toxic thoughts that plague me now.

Is this something common for people with intrusive thoughts?"
Anxiety,Good and Bad Days,I've feeling anxious off and on for almost two years. At time I feel like it has went away and then it starts up again. I had blood work and other medical tests.

Anxiety,Daily Social Interactions,"This might be more related to social anxiety but I think it's more of general anxiety for myself. Does anyone find it hard to talk with people face to face like to the people you live together with? I don't know how to explain this but it is somewhat hard to try and talk even just a little bit with them, it's not like you're ditching them on purpose to hurt their feelings or something but it just happens to be like that. For me the cause might be the fear of the outcome of the conversation like it can go unexpectedly bad. is it bad if it happens to me?"
Anxiety,What is one of the most helpful things your therapist etc has told you regarding dealing with anxiety?,"Just needing a boost right now and I'm sure some of you guys do too! One of the most helpful things I was told was by a psychiatrist, he told me about exactly what is happening in my brain when I'm having an episode; that is the amygdala is misfiring and telling me I'm in danger when I'm not. He also said that as I had childhood trauma, I was reliving it everytime something newly traumatic happened, even if it was only small. He also said that sometimes when someone has something traumatic happen in childhood, the amygdala becomes 'broken' as such and that's why in adulthood it's all over the place, suddenly basically making you feel like the world is ending while you're just sitting chilling having a nice time. It helped me to learn exactly what was causing as it showed me the fear was not based on anything real, my brain was just getting mixed up. I tell you this in case it helps any of you too and please share what's helped you :)"
Anxiety,i think i’m finally going to make a doctor’s appointment,"i’m not sure if it’s definitely anxiety related but i’ve had chest/throat problems since august which started the day that a family member died which was also a couple of days after i tried weed so i’ve been scared it’s either something that i’ve done to my body or that it’s all down to stress and i didn’t want to waste a doctor’s time or admit that i tried it to my parents. While i can think that it could be nothing physically wrong with me or maybe it’s acid reflux based on my throat, I’ve fully convinced myself it’s lung cancer or heart failure or so many other things (like lung necrosis??) so i think i’m finally going to make an appointment at the doctors this week because i hate living how i currently am thinking that i’m on the verge of death and thinking i’m not going to wake up the next morning.  However, as i’m 17 my mum would want me to book my own appointment and this is another thing that’s made me leave it so long as i struggle a lot with calls"
Anxiety,"Being ""slow""","Hi guys,
first of all, I apologize for the level of my english, i am not native speaker, hopefully you will understand.
I am 23yo. I've been battling with anxiety from my early childhood and interestingly it was not from specific thing or event, but I was literally scared and still am from everything (social events, being asked question in school, driving - still didnt pass driving school to this day). Reason is that i am slow. I am slow at thinking, realizing things, reacting to events, learning new things, understanding stuff, you get the point, that quiet kid at the back of the class. And definitely not competitive person. I am terrified of failure because i got used to failing. I've always been last at everything. Therefore my confidence is practically zero. The world seems like too quick for me (you know?). I just want to know if anyone is feeling (felt) same way. All love :)"

On the other hand I feel like i suffer daily with anxiety/stress physical symptoms... not overpowering or anything like that but mild but enough to notice them. Feeling jittery, head feels woozy, voice trembly/shaky and breaks time to time, muscles feel like i have ran a marathon, tension headaches. These symptoms i feel mildly daily without even feeling anxious or stressed not sure if my body think it’s my new norm now.

Not really hyperventilating, but my breathing feels very shallow &amp; like I can't get a breath that's ""deep"" enough, even when I try really hard. It started out only happening in the evenings (when sitting on the couch doing nothing) but is now happening all day &amp; i woke up twice last night due to difficulty breathing. I had a panic attack last night for the first time in years because I was talking too fast &amp; couldn't catch my breath at all for a few minutes &amp; thought I was suffocating. I've tried many breathing techniques &amp; none seem to help.

The thing is, I've dealt with severe anxiety &amp; OCD for over ten years &amp; I have NEVER experienced this before. Everyone keeps insisting that it must be anxiety related, but I have actually been doing very well with my anxiety lately &amp; I am at a pretty calm/content state most of the time. 

I received a negative COVID test a few days ago, my blood pressure is really good, my pulse rate is normal, &amp; otherwise I feel fine (aside from dizziness &amp; feeling lightheaded as a result of the breathing problems). Is it normal for this to just randomly happen with anxiety disorders? 

And yes, i will be booking an appointment with my doctor today. Just wanted to see if others have experienced this."
Anxiety,Tingling sensation in right hand,"I’m not sure if this has to do with anxiety per-say, but sometimes I randomly get this annoying tingling sensation in my hand and it’s just super annoying and uncomfortable, but I don’t know how to stop it. Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,Weed helps me,"Does anyone else find that weed helps their anxiety, like I know for some people it makes it worse but for me when I’m having a panic attack or freaking out weed just shuts out the noise in my head. I have OCD too and fuck man it really helps me, anyone else feel the same?!!!"
Anxiety,Switching jobs anxiety,"Currently working at a job I hate with a passion. Wasn’t hired for what I’m doing, didn’t ask to move to this department, but got a pay raise but I suck at what I’m doing. My boss said if I want to switch back to what I did before I can, but I won’t be paid as much. It’s also toxic. A lot of extra stress, I’m just super unhappy. I’ve been here since September after being at a job before for over 2 years. 

So I decided to look elsewhere and I found a job that’s what I did before I got moved and I really thrive in the field, more money than I’ve made here ever, and it’s seemingly awesome. I’ll be working from home, which is new to me so I can’t say yeah I’m happy or not with that I can just say maybe. But the thing that scares me is it’s a 1099 job. With that said, I am following advice after doing research of saving 30% of my check each week and also saving receipts and stuff. I don’t get insurance here and I got insurance elsewhere which doesn’t cost me much. 

I’m just worried cause I guess it’s a big change and change brings me anxiety. Any advice?"
Anxiety,"I woke up with so much anxiety this morning, but I know nothings wrong","How do I (F22) get out of my head? My boyfriend (M21) goes to college an hour and a half away from me and when he’s not at college he lives 2 and a half hours away from me. We have amazing plans this summer and I’m so excited. It’s just really hard not being with him. I don’t have any doubts, and I trust him whole heartedly. But when I’m with him I feel really safe and happy. He’s not too far but it feels like he is sometimes. I know exactly how I feel about him and I think that’s why this is so difficult. I’ve never felt this strongly for someone else before."
Anxiety,Had my first car accident yesterday,"Thankfully me and my passenger were not hurt. The other driver was fortunately not hurt either. 

I’m so lost. I don’t even know what to do. I’m waiting for the adjuster but I miss my car. It took so much to finally get my drivers license and a good car and now it’s just…gone. 

I’m still processing it I think. I just want to go back and be a little late or early. It wouldn’t have happened. 

I’m just afraid. I don’t want to look for a new car. I don’t want to wait for mine to be fixed. 

I’m sorry for rambling but idk where else to post."
Anxiety,"My three biggest fears are drowning, heights, and other people.","People really scare me, many people are unpredictable and I always say that you cannot trust anyone but yourself. You can be out one day and someone decides to hurt/even try to kill you which has happened to me in the past. People are what really scare me in this life and I think about many potential situations from some reason. I am scared of people and avoid going out when I can especially with all of the crazy shit that happens in my state/this country in general. I’m afraid of the unknown(what people are thinking and their correlating actions) and working in customer service has made me hate people even more with how angry some get over small things that can be resolved. I’m lonely, sad, and just overall hurt in my life ):"
Anxiety,I got accepted into a BBA program at a university. The last thing I want to do is go back to school after being in school for so long. I dread being back in a classroom. I just want to start doing something other than school. Can’t sleep at night thinking about this. Any advice?,
Anxiety,For fuck sake i have no idea what to do,"I can’t get therapy because it costs too much, and a free one takes months for me, all the hotlines are not available and closed and nobody seems to give ten shits that i can’t cope, so wtf do i do when nothing works and my anxiety wont go.  Can someone pls help me."
Anxiety,My boss won’t stop guilting me to make me work more over time,"I’m so fucking exhausted. And I know she is too, but i already work full-time. It wasn’t part of my job description that I HAVE to work over 40 hrs. But I’ve been doing it. And it’s still not enough for her. I can’t cover all of the open hours dude. I need time to myself for my mental health. I’m not sure how I even manage to work full time. I am house supervisor over other staff and take care of two adults with severe mental and physical disabilities. They haven’t been able to leave the house bc of Covid. To say I’m about to lose my fucking mind is an understatement. Don’t get me wrong, I love them. But I NEED time to myself."
Anxiety,Worrying about my nightmares,"I have (GAD).
I have nightmares at night and then I worry about the nightmare during the day, all day. 
Like for example the other night i had a dream that my dog was throwing up and then that day I was worrying that it might actually happen. Does anyone else get this with GAD?"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when someone doesn’t communicate with them about plans?,"For whatever reason, my body goes straight into anxiety mode (and mostly being bummed out) whenever a friend messages me, tells me we should do something later and that they’ll hit me up again, and then they just never do. It’s like I get this feeling of “oh, they don’t actually like me. whatever they got tied up with, they just decided it was much more important than me.”

Does anyone else deal with this? And if so, how do you get your mind off things?

I feel so silly asking this question. I know that people get busy but it still sucks getting my hopes up and trying to basically tell myself that I’m not getting another message as each hour passes and to just not worry about it. :/  for whatever reason I just feel so much better if someone takes the time to just quickly message “hey I think I’m actually gonna be busy tonight, but text me tomorrow and we’ll reschedule!”"
Anxiety,Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy for Anxiety?,Has anyone had success with BCST for anxiety or anxiety/depression? I’m at a point where I need something but am skeptical of meds and their side effects.
Anxiety,i wish my anxiety was just overthinking,"my anxiety makes me nauseous and shiver so much i can’t sleep. my anxiety makes me push people away because i think they don’t like me anymore and i’d rather reject them , than be rejected. my anxiety keeps me up for hours. when i’m having an anxiety attack my stomach aches, my legs shake uncontrollably, and i feel so sick i can’t even talk. coping mechanisms like 54321 don’t even work for me   i just have to go through it."
Anxiety,Fever after having a panic attack,Last night I had a pretty bad panic attack. As I was falling asleep I noticed my breathing was slowing down and then I felt a sensation in my neck/face and it set off my panic attack. My anxiety tried convincing me I was having a heart attack because my heart rate kept going from fast to slow pace. My anxiety always claims I’m having a heart attack or stroke during a panic attack so that’s not new. Although it was trying to make it seems different this time. I managed to mostly calm down but my body has been so hot since then. That never happens after I have a panic attack. I don’t know if it’s due to not sleeping too well the past couple days and I just feel like crap now or what. My temperature ranges from 99.4 - 99.7 degrees which is not normal at all for me. Does anyone else get a fever after having a panic attack? Being worried about this might damn well trigger another one lol
Anxiety,went to see a new psychiatrist for an ADD diagnosis...came out with a bipolar diagnosis instead???,"so about 2 years ago i started having really terrible panic attacks and anxiety that was interfering with my day to day life and making me miserable so i went to see a psychiatrist. I was prescribed lexapro and xanax and have been taking that ever since. Recently, I’ve been having an insane amount of trouble with school and life in general in regards to my difficulty focusing and concentrating. I’ve been seeing a lot of tik toks about adult women diagnosed with ADHD later in life and everything they were saying was exactly how I felt. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and told her about my symptoms including feeling exhausted all the time. She kept focusing on the tiredness and decided to lower my lexapro dosage thinking it was a side effect. I was really upset because I felt like she didn’t actually listen to what I was saying and focused on something that was annoying but not affecting me as much as the focus and concentration. 
After about a month of lowered Lexapro dosage and not feeling any increase in anxiety, I decided to have a fresh start and see a new psychiatrist. I told him about my history and my new symptoms that were affecting me greatly. He asked if i was impulsive (which I am since I have about 6 tattoos that were all walk ins lol) and if i have anger issues. I do get really irritable a lot where every sound annoys me and everything that people are doing around me annoys me and i’ll snap at people and then feel really bad after. I feel like it’s mostly a sensory overload thing where i just get really overwhelmed by everything around me. I don’t really think it’s an issue and I feel like everyone gets this way. 
After he asks all the questions he tells me i don’t have ADD and he wants me to 1. stop taking the lexapro , 2. stop drinking coffee and 3. start taking lamictal. After i got off the phone with him, i looked up the lamictal and found out it’s a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. so now i’m freaking out because apparently i have bipolar disorder and i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop taking the lexapro because i feel like it really helps my anxiety and i don’t know a lot about lamictal. but i’m also curious to see if the lamictal helps but i still feel like this isn’t going to do much for my difficulty in working. anyways i’m just looking for advice, encouragement, just anything to help me off the cliff lol"
Anxiety,Hydroxyzine,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here. I have struggled with anxiety since I was 11/12 years old. I have been on lots of different medications for anxiety including Klonapin, Paxil, Cymbalta, etc. I switched over to Zoloft last October and was also prescribed Hydroxzine to help with increased anxiety. I have 25mg pills and I take one in the morning and one at night and more throughout the day if I need it.

I've been having a lot of side effects from both medications but the side effect that's bothering me the most is fatigue. It's not exactly tired in the way that I'm sleepy and need to nap, it's like I have no stamina. It mostly happens when I stand up. I am so fatigued that I cannot stand up for very long without having to sit down.

I told my doctor about this and she said it's probably the Hydroxzine causing this. She told me to try and cut back on it if I could. I guess ideally I will not have to take the Hydroxyzine and will okay just on the Zoloft.

I was wondering if anyone else has taken Hydroxzine and had a side effect like this? I recently found out Hydroxzine is a an antihistamine like Benadryl which makes sense. Hydroxzine has helped a lot with acute anxiety when I increase my Zoloft dose but I am honestly tired of being exhausted."
Anxiety,Please talk me into going to class later,"I’m so behind. Like really behind. I have a new project for the class where we’re designing a calendar. It’s a lot of work and I’m incredibly behind. I have my idea, all of my inspiration and the idea fully fleshed out in my head, but I have no sketches and not one number, day, or month completed.

I got behind in another art class and am finally caught up there but now I’m a week behind on this project for this class. There’s been so much going on with school and my personal life and it’s been causing me to procrastinate or sleep wayyy too long and shut down from being overwhelmed and I have no idea how to explain that to my professor as the reason I have nothing to show for progress except an idea. It also doesn’t help that my laptop was on the fritz and refused to update for a few days which prevented me from opening the file I needed for the assignment.

I’m tempted to not go but I’m trying to break the habit of just completely missing class because I’m ashamed but I’m struggling. I don’t wanna seem like I’m taking advantage of my professor’s kindness and patience but it’s so embarrassing and literally unexplainable as a decent excuse. Please talk me into going to class and facing him without crying. Please."
Anxiety,Why did I get anxiety even though I was confident before,I used to feel confident talking to strangers until about 11 and now I feel I have got worse. Even a couple of days ago my parents invited 2 friends over a man and a woman and I was very shy and I didn't want to say hi but my mum made me carry there drinks to them outside and I was shaking and I didn't know what to say. And it felt a bit embarisning. Also now when I walk my dog and people talk to me I don't know what to say and I feel bad. And also at school I hate talking out in the class when the teacher asks a question and I get scared when every person looks at me and I hate it so bad
Anxiety,Medication Advice. (UK),"Hey, I've recently started suffering from crippling anxiety. I was unable to work for 2 months and now I'm back on a phased return. I've seen my GP and they haven't been the most helpful and I've also sought out private therapy.

I've been really resistant to medication but I'm wondering if it will help.

My symptoms are nausea, heart palpitations, headaches and lack of sleep. I went to a&amp;e when this started in Feb as I thought I was having a heart attacked. I'm F27 so rather young. I was shocked when they said it was a panic attack because other then getting nervous for things you would consider normal, such as job interviews... Ive never had any issues. 

Talking with my therapist we are going through the trauma of my brother passing when I was young and I don't think its a coincidence the panic attack happened a year to the date of my friends death. 

I'm just getting super frustrated now feeling so shocking and will do anything to get these feeling to stop! So medication.. does it help?"
Anxiety,Job interviews..,"I recently left my retail management job back in February (you probably can assume why), and am finally getting back in the job market. Interview for a Medical imaging center in 3 hours, and one for Asst. manager of a storage facility tomorrow. Both opportunities would be super exciting but I haven’t been sleeping at all due to a lot of overthinking. I’m super anxious about the Imaging center job because I only met the basic qualifications (Patient coordinator / Receptionist) But they called me almost immediately after i put in my application, so i will try my best!! The storage facility also called back like 30 mins after submitting and actually began a pre-interview on the phone which i nailed (wtf right?), i’m really thinking that’s the way i’m gonna go because i have the preferred experience for that job, and it’s a moving mgr position, where i would likely be by myself at different stores at times, which sounds like a dream to me! 
I turn 19 in a few weeks so the fact i’m still so young is also pretty daunting..
Arrgh, sorry about the vent, really needed that off my chest!!!"

Anxiety,In Need of support with GAD and Panic Disorder,"Hello, 
I joined this group to find some support. I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder since 2019. 
The past few days have been really rough. I feel nervous and stuck and I can’t get even a quarter of what I want done every day. And that just triggers more anxiety of what will happen if I don’t finish my tasks. 
Any of advice, tips, or words of support would be appreciated !"
Anxiety,Does anyone else struggle with starting on school projects due to fear of failing it no matter what you do and then getting screamed at for that failure? Or is this just me?,Title is question
Anxiety,I get paranoid about alot of things and I don't know if would be considered having anxiety.,"ok I absolutely hate talking to people. I don't mean that in a bad way I just absolutely dread the thought of talking to someone and then they take it the wrong way.
Another thing is being late for school. I break in to a meltdown and then have to ask my parents to drive me to school.
And I always feel people are judging me behind my back. It could just be me being self conscious (as usual). 
I think that's it. Would any of you consider it anxiety or just paranoia."

Anxiety,Work Anxiety Is Debilitating,"I hate my job. I've lived with chronic anxiety and the last three years I've worked here it's gotten significantly worse. I have no support, no respect, and now my depression has come back. 

My background is in communication and marketing. I wear so many hats now, from marketing to accounting to IT support to HR. My battle the last few months is trying to learn a new system from scratch, including the portions I know very little to nothing about - accounting and project management. I've problem solved and built it up as best as I can with no help and am constantly just getting more on my plate. Today my bosses came down asking about if the accounting is in order and all set and to date. They don't give me access to anything. I can't get into QuickBooks outside of what they give me, bank statements outside of what they give me, all of which is usually paper copies and only half of what I need. 

I'm literally so anxious that a simple question just makes me want to cry. They add another task to my pile and I just freeze, feeling overwhelmed and like I've already failed. I hate it here. I sit at home after work thinking of all the things I didn't accomplish in the day and what I have to accomplish the next day. The clock turns and the end of the day is near and I feel my body tensing and the anxiety about work starts to set in again, when I barely just got it to leave. I'm so anxious and I have so many things to do but it's the time in the day where I've hit a roadblock from getting overwhelmed and trying to do too many things at once. I give it an hour before I get the courage to settle in and take another stab at the important stuff. 

Fucking Mondays. 


Big thanks to this community for giving me a place to feel a little less alone. I'm usually a lurker but it's nice to know that it isn't just me. Thanks for letting me vent."
Anxiety,CBD?,"Hey all,

I've been experiencing severe anxiety for several months now and I'm hesitant to start new pills as citalopram wasn't good for me.  

Anybody here try CBD gummies / oils?"
Anxiety,Bumped into a person and laughed about it instead!,"So one of my biggest anxiety issues is replaying a situation (that was awkward) over and over again until I literally feel physically ill.

Today a man was fixing some tiles in my house and I was going to show him where to fix it and I accidentally passed him when he didn’t see me so I kinda got squished between him and the cupboards behind me. I felt really embarrassed in that moment repeating “I’m sorry” but I was telling my brain over and over again “it’s fine, both of you laughed it off” and by some miracle it worked!

It’s been a couple hours and I was thinking back at it and instead of crying about I laughed. So I guess that’s some progress."
Anxiety,"Something as ""simple"" as a phone call","I have social anxiety really bad, I can barely hold a conversation and when my phone rings I usually can't answer it. 

My cat's vet just called. I knew why they were calling, and I answered. I told her what I needed to tell her without even stuttering and everything got straightened out (chewy authorization for cat's prescription food, I had already uploaded the form they sent me so they didn't need to do anything) and I felt so insanely proud of myself that I started giggling, which made my 1.5 year old start giggling, and it was just a great experience and it brought some joy into my house. It's so hard to remember that it will be okay while the phone is ringing though. Why am I like this 😭"
Anxiety,I dont see a way of life for myself,"""If my mother taught me anything, it is to be independent. Marriage is a great thing, but if ure bound to another to live [earning money] uve set yourself up for unhappiness.""

I dont see how I'm ever going to be able to take care of myself alone. I wish anxiety never happened to me. A few years back this exact reason is what made me suicidal, and im afraid it will happen again and make me more depressed and anxious by the day."
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"I pick at my acne a lot to the point where it starts to bleed. I used to do it to my lips to the point where they’d bleed to, and before that, nails. I do it out of habit now but I’m wondering if anxiety caused this habit to happen?"
Anxiety,Accepting my anxiety (GAD),"After months of being diagnosed with Gad by my psyciatrist iv finally accepted that I have gad. People like my mental health nurse always have said (what are you worrying about or what's making you anxious) but iv always said (no nothing) but if finally noticed that I worry about my nightmares that Iv had that night and worry about that during the day. I also hear voices in my head and I'm very scared and paranoid but I'll explain that in another post 👍. (BTW psychosis and schizophrenia are RULED OUT), my psyciatrist said the voices and paranoia are NOT due to psychosis or schizophrenia) 
I just have severe Gad."
Anxiety,Having a really hard time right now,"I have been suffering from anxiety for as long as I can remember. I went to counseling a little during college for self harming, but eventually just stopped showing up. 
I’ve been referred to mental health services by my previous GP and never did anything about it.

Now like 3 years later I have a new GP and she recommended me for mental health services as well. She gave me the paper with the information to call and I frickin put it down and now it’s gone. And of course like having to reach out and ask for another paper or call is like so terrifying to me.

I just would love to finally have an official diagnosis (I also am pretty sure I have ADHD inattention) and get coping strategies so I can function better and not sit at work procrastinating because I’m scared to read emails. 

I literally am sitting here trying to schedule meetings and I wanna throw up. 

I just need a hug."
Anxiety,Anxious before work or thinking of work,"I have been at my job almost 6yrs come mid august. I’m in tech support from home and in recent past few years my anxiety has risen for some reason. I get anxious the night before and the morning before I’m supposed to go into work. Some of it seems to be fear of the unknown, what may come on the other end of the phone call, hearing from my manager for fear of bad news or something. Fear of losing my job. I’ll at times avoid or delay certain tasks at work. Due to afraid of what the response may be. Such as having to calling someone and giving bad news and afraid may go off or something. Everyone I’ve worked with though has said I do great and very nice and considerate. But that I need to have more confidence in myself. I know I need more confidence and I like the company I work for and would be hard to find another job with the pay and benefits I get from them. I want to grow and move in the company. 

Typically it’s hard getting through the door and started, but once I do and as day goes on typically ends up not being so bad and see it as that wasn’t so bad. Why’d I make it a big deal. But I’ll typically get anxious and sometimes my mind tries to spiral into excuses to try snd call out or maybe stomach gets upset/IBS-D. I also deal with financial stress , depression from having bad back (from wrecks etc) being bigger guy and not lost the weight I want and need too. I also tend to be an over thinker as well. 

Any advice that helps get you through the door to get into to work and stay in and over your anxiety/ overthinking would be appreciated. I have seen multiple doctors, therapist etc. also on some medication as well. But doesn’t seem to help as much as used too at times."
Anxiety,"I'm quitting my job today, and it feels like a weight is off my shoulders","I've been in telephone-based customer service for a year and a half, and while my workplace is likely the best call center community I've ever seen, we haven't had a chance to experience this since before COVID. Instead it's been working at home and dealing with, in the words of my therapist, ""verbal abuse"" that takes place over the phone when a member is angry. I held out during COVID so I could keep working, but drew the imaginary line in the sand last week when I considered checking into the hospital due to feeling the need to hurt myself (a bad habit, but three years clean), finally reaching the point where I could say ""I'm done"".

I don't yet have another job lined up - the most stressful part of quitting now, but I plan on a strict regimen of waking up early like I'm going into work, all to get applications done and start daily workouts again. 

I have time off saved up to cash in on and provide a cushion while I get my new job. I live with my grandmother to whom I pay fair rent to, and she is reducing rent for two months while everything comes together.

Even my parents support me on this decision - something I've never had before.

I just sent the email. Even with anti-anxiety medication I am fluttering."
Anxiety,I feel like everything in my life is against me at the moment,"To give some background, I’m a 24 year old male from the UK.

I’ve been a sufferer of anxiety for a while now over the last few months I’ve been starting to feel really down. I’ve been getting extremely irritated and annoyed at even the slightest things, and I feel like a lot of it is due to lockdown. A few of the things that have happened to me recently are:

* I had my first PhD paper (very harshly and unjustifiably) rejected after being under review since last September 

* I got rejected following a job interview (been applying to get a job for when I finish my PhD)

* The other day I bumped my car on a rock that was in my blind spot and scraped it - minor thing but still annoying

* 2 of my housemates have “got together” - this only winds me up because I’ve been with my gf for 6 years now and still only get to see her at weekends and at a distance due to lockdown/Covid, yet my housemates seem to rub the fact they’ve got each-other in my face

* The fact I don’t live with my girlfriend yet (due to Covid &amp; my study commitments here)

There’s a few other things, but I find myself just getting so wound up about everything in life at the moment. Part of me feels bad for getting down/stressed/anxious about these things because I know there’s people in much worse situations in the world than me, and it makes me question how I’ll actually cope when I have a real emergency. Does anyone have any advice?"
Anxiety,You are so much stronger than you think!,"I’ve been browsing this subreddit for a while. And while I often suffer from anxiety, I realised that so many of you got it so much worse than me.

Do you know how freaking strong you are?

You go through your life with all this anxiety. And every time you do something that people without it do without a second thought, it takes so much of your energy. But you do it. You live your life. One step after the other. And that’s enough.

I admire you so much for it. For keeping on fighting when you feel like crawling under a rock and hiding from the rest of the world. 

You’re amazing!"
Anxiety,it’s hard,"my anxiety has hit really bad again. I feel anxious about anything and everything, i know it’s bad when i lose all of appetite because I eat quite a lot. I have been trying to find a therapist but the place i’m calling hasn’t been picking up and it’s frustrating me because the one time I do try and reach out for help, it doesn’t happen. I don’t know why i’m even feeling anxious, i’m done with school in 2 weeks and i’ve been telling myself to push through but honestly i don’t think school is the problem because I have been doing quite fine this semester. Prior to my anxiety hitting really bad, I would always have my camera on and participate in these zoom classes but now it’s a struggle to even pay attention in class. I sometimes beat myself up for it even though I shouldn’t because I tell myself “all you have to do is sit there, why do you have anxiety?” but then another part of me is like “it’s okay to feel like this, you will be fine.” My mind just feels jumbled at the moment, i want to get back to myself but it’s so hard when anxiety interferes. I want  to make an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about medication, but I honestly don’t even know how to get to a psychiatrist, it all just feels so hard right now. Does anyone else ever feel like this?"
Anxiety,I can’t even think straight anymore,"I just turned 20 a couple days ago. I had a panic attack the night before thinking that something really bad was going to happen. My birthday turned out to be the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. The next day I became anxious and I felt a depressive episode coming. My anxiety can be described as overanalyzing absolutely everything in the past, present, and future. It’s hard for me to keep up with conversations because my mind won’t stop racing and I’m too busy analyzing I miss what someone said and then start worrying about that. I’m having so much anxiety just putting this into words because I’m worried no one will understand it. Just sending a text message puts me at a stand still and I’ve decided to stay in my room and not do anything to avoid anything that can be overanalyzed. I’m so drained because I just need a break. I can’t sleep and this is the first time I’ve thought about hurting myself. My anxiety is so bad that my fear of dying and pain is the only thing keeping me alive. I feel like I’m at the lowest point and I don’t know what to do. I need to hear something from anyone that can reassure me or just make my mind stop for a second."
Anxiety,Can anyone with OCD help calm me?,"So for the past 2 days I’ve woke up POCD has hit me bad. As SOON as I wake up I get intrusive images of naked girls. And the thing is is Since I just woke up I can’t even get my bearings. I can’t tell if those images are really young girls or girls my age, I can’t tell if I like the thoughts, I’m panicking. As soon as this happens my stomach knots up and hurts so freaking bad. And immediately after that I have IBS issues from it. Do I really enjoy these thoughts but I’m scared to admit it???? Why does it feel like I like these thoughts? I can’t even tell if they’re girls my age or girls younger and its scaring me. Please I need someone to calm me because I’m so scared"
Anxiety,Anxiety at nighttime and sleeping on stomach,"As stated, my worst anxiety is at nighttime and the only way I can fall asleep is by sleeping on my stomach. Something about having the mattress pressed against my chest is comforting to me and nothing else works. This has caused neck/jaw pain (I also clench jaw in sleep) but it is better than being exhausted. I believe this is related to abandonment and early childhood issues/trauma. I have tried sleeping on my side and I can occasionally but I need to be very closely hugging a pillow in the fetal position, which has caused new muscle tightness issues in my hips/knees. The entire situation is just miserable and something I have been dealing with for a very long time. Does anyone else experience this?"
Anxiety,i just can’t stop crying,"I woke up today and haven’t been able to stop crying. I can’t take the anxiety anymore... the sweaty palms, racing thoughts, tight chest, knots in my stomach, unable to breath... it gets in the way of everything in my life. 

my relationship with myself, my partner my friendships. 

my job. i can’t hold a job to save my life bc one “bad” thing happens and i spiral, leave my job and start over somewhere else. 

rinse and repeat. 

i have a few good days, if I’m luck a week or 2. it never lasts, it never stays. i just want it to stop ffs please I’m begging you."
Anxiety,Need medication but I’m too scared to ask for it in case I gain weight,"I (19 F) have experienced pretty bad anxiety on and off for about 7 years now and I think I’m finally at the breaking point and need help. I’ve never went to the doctors because I’m embarrassed and I also try to convince myself I’m making up my anxiety in my head and that I don’t really need help or even a diagnosis whatsoever because I’m just taking it. My dad also struggles with both anxiety and depression which for some reason makes me feel even more embarrassed and uncomfortable admitting that I might need help. My struggles could never compare to his and I know my parents will think I’m a fake or that they won’t fully grasp that I struggle too.

Anyway what made me start to think about getting help is my job. I managed to get my job back after having lost it because of Covid but only a week in I’m already really struggling to get through a 9 hour shift. The first half is fine, I feel great and productive enough to keep up with my other co workers. But about an hour in to the second half I fall apart. I start thinking that everyone is mad at me or hates me. Whenever a co worker speaks to a manager I think they’re talking about me. I start thinking that there is no way I can keep up with everyone else and about how they’re all miles better than I am at the job. At this point I usually start crying and I work in retail so I have to try and hide my face from the customers while still trying to tidy the shop and deal with all the other stuff I need to get done before close. The thing that really gets to me and makes me upset though is thinking about how they asked me to come back and work for them when other people I worked with before who were miles better than I am weren’t asked to come back. I feel incredibly guilty and like I’m letting them all down. I also fear my boss will fire me for doing such a shitty job because I find it hard tidying everything in a timely manner when my hands won’t stop shaking and I’m struggling to breathe because of my anxiety and my face mask. I get extremely overwhelmed and I haven’t had a panic attack at work yet but it’s scary because I constantly feel for the last few hours that I’m on the verge of having one.

My friend knows about this and she’s worried for me and wants me to get help but I know I’d be given meds because of how off the rails my anxiety is and I’m scared to take them. I really want to avoid gaining weight at all costs and I already only eat a very very limited selection of foods to avoid bloating (I have pretty severe ibs) because I don’t want to look fat. I’m only a U.S.A. size 2/UK size 6 but I’m an hourglass shape with poochy stomach, big bum, thick thighs, etc. So although I’m slim I definitely don’t have the ideal body and could never compete with girls who are straight up and down with a flat tummy. That could never be me because even my bones stick out way too much for that - my rib cage is large and my hip bones are really wide in comparison to my waist. The idea of looking even bigger or curvier than I am already makes me feel sick and panicky. I already have so much anxiety over the way my body looks and I worry that everyone thinks I’m fat because of my legs and hips and tummy. I also feel one of my friends already judges my weight because she always tries to pick out clothes for me that are about two sizes larger than what I actually am, and when I told her about a tank top having straps that were too large that they would fall off my shoulders she said I should try a size or two up. So I really don’t want to be looking any bigger than how I look already :((

Will anxiety medication really make me gain weight? If it does I don’t even want to bother going through the process of asking for help because the idea is incredibly scary and would make me feel vulnerable for the sake of nothing. Are there any particular meds to stay away from for this? And when it comes to medication would I be given it long term? Apparently long term is when you can gain a lot of weight and I really really don’t want that. I’m not kidding when I say I would immediately stop taking the meds if I noticed weight gain even if it was at the expense of my mental health. At that point I wouldn’t care how awful I felt mentally anymore just as long as I could prevent further weight gain. I just hope that I can find medication that makes me feel good again without ruining my body

Any help would be really appreciated 💗"

Anxiety,I made it inside the office!,"Evey day last week I called out sick or straight-up flaked on work because my anxiety and depression were so bad. They're still bad today, but today I squared my shoulders and went in anyway, even though I didn't want to. Right now, things still suck and I'm not being very productive, but at least I'm here. Something is better than nothing.

(Also, I just started meds this weekend and am in therapy, so hopefully things will improve soon.)"

Anxiety,Indecisiveness,"I can’t decide if I wanna quit my job or not and it’s legit giving me so much anxiety I keep second guessing. I have another one lined up, my two weeks notice typed, I just don’t know what I wanna do. My start day is 5/17."
Anxiety,"Anxiety is returning again (nsfw stuff, eating disorder like symptoms)","About 4 months ago I had a girlfriend that I really liked. Sometimes when I was around her (big plans, meeting her parent, etc.) I would get anxious, not really mentally but physically. I had nothing to be worried about but I would still feel nauseous, even throw up sometimes, I’d also feel numbness in my palms and occasional shivering/shaking. I talked about it with my parents actively which helped and it hasn’t happened since the horrendous week we broke up. I was nearly unable to eat coupled with the other mentioned symptoms and I actually had something to worry about, it was hell. I’m long past that now but recently this girl in attracted to has been messaging me saying incredibly (like incredibly) lewd things and I’m really not used that kind of attention from a girl. Since last night where it started I’ve felt the aforementioned symptoms return going on and off depending on how distracted I am. I can’t tell my parents why I’m so high strung because there’s no way I could tell them about this, which is making my dad assume I have covid making it even worse. I wanna actually do stuff with the girl but I don’t wanna puke while we’re trying to do stuff yknow, I really wanna control or suppress this but it’s really hard. If anyone has any tips I’d be really really grateful"
Anxiety,Is it bad of me to cancel an appointment due to anxiety,"I have a dentist appointment on Thursday but I’ve been thinking about it non stop for the past few weeks and all it does it make me sick and set my heart racing. 

I’m on the way to fixing my anxiety, I’ve started with a counsellor but my anxiety is so horrendous at the moment that I can barely go anywhere populated. Taking the dog out is fine, going by myself to the shops for food is fine if I’m quick. But the waiting in the queue (which will be a literal standing queue because of covid I’d have to line up outside unlike a normal waiting room) really stresses me out and makes me feel like I’m going to pass out. The sitting with my mouth open basically I’m not allowed to move and I’m completely out of control - just the thought of this is setting my skin on fire. 

All of my symptoms seem uncontrollable:

Feeling like I’m going to pass out
Feeling like I’m going to shit myself
Feeling sick
Dissociating 

I can’t calm myself down once it goes past a certain point and I just don’t think I can do this appointment.

Is it going to sort of delay my recovery if I cancel or is that self care because it’s not urgent and I can wait until covid has calmed down more for the UK."
Anxiety,I wasted my time to a useless degree due to my anxiety,"Sorry for my long post and my English 

When I was 18 I went to college to become a kindergarten teacher and I tried to stay alone but coming from a very traumatic experience in my house and not even having the basic skills to survive alone my anxiety got over me and I returned home. In my country to change college and study subject you must give again exams so I did that in order to stay at home while I was in college and I choose to study history because I was not accepted in English or psychology major and because I knew it didn't has much self exposure as a major.
 The next 6 years was a hell. I tried a lot of times to change my major and I got accepted in English but my anxiety didn't let me to make the change. I visited so many psychiatrists and therapists, I was diagnosed with ocd, I took medication, I even had a psychotic episode some years ago because I became so anxious with job prospects. I wasted so much energy to decide if I will follow history or archaeology, because my uni had these two different directions, I did so many stupid compulsions, I lost my sleep, I punished and neglected myself to the point not even care for my hygiene. I even spent money to stupid fortune tellers to find a solution, I'm so ashamed of my self. I delayed my degree waiting for a stupid sign to tell me what to do and in the end I managed to pass 20 classes in six months to take a history degree eventhough I wanted to study archaelogy but again my stupid anxiety holded me back.

I really don't know how to forgive myself because I feel so stupid that I wasted my time obsessing with stupid signs or which subject other good students chose or making exhausting rituals trying to find an answer. Many people regretting their degree but at least they liked it or at least they didn't torture theirselves in this way. I'm 28 years old never had a job and I don't have the energy neither the motivation anymore to try again something new. It's such a same because I really wanted to keep studying andvsearching but my anxiety and ocd drained everything from me."
Anxiety,Feeling off my feet,"I have immense fear for standing at school with all the kids , I start feeling like my legs are gonna give out under me and I start panicking .I sometimes scratch myself very badly is this normal ? It causes me to feel dizzy most of the time"
Anxiety,Paranoid and scared,Sorry I deleted my last post about this but I spelt it wrong. Anyways I'm very paranoid about monster's and people are around me. When I'm in shopping I think that people are looking at me and that there are cameras only showing my face on it and when I'm out walking on the street I'm paranoid that people have cameras recording my movements. When I'm at home it's like a general feeling of paranoid and scared thoughts. I HATE Gad.
Anxiety,Pls read,I had an allergic reaction to medicine once and it made me faint and it was actually a near death experience my doc said!! It was just THE worst experience.. WELL that same faint feeling is how I feel when my panic attacks happen and it always scares me that I’m dying. Anyway to overcome this fear of fainting?! I feel like if I wasn’t scared to faint and the feelings weren’t so similar to my near death experience then panic attacks wouldn’t really bother me as much
Anxiety,How to end my relationship with Dr. google,"Dr. google and I have a very toxic relationship. He gaslights me a lot, and convinces me of a lot of things that aren't true. He ruined my weekend by convincing me my boyfriend was dying of Marfans Syndrome, and is still ruining my Monday with this nonsense.

My friend commented this weekend that my boyfriend looks like he could have marfans. He only has a few characteristics, but now I'm full blown down the rabbit hole. Dr. Google and I have been having a field day. I'm convinced he'll have an aorta anyresume before his appointment in two months, that he's doomed, that maybe I have it too my arms are a little long, I'm stalking his family members FBS and Instagrams looking for signs of it, or ways to prove he doesn't have it, ""See! His cousin always has crowded teeth, and therefore ext ext."" But nothing that rules in the favor of him not having it comforts me and every little sign he does it killing my soul. Noticing stretch marks while giving him a backrub? That's definitely not because he had a growth spurt, and also used to be very overweight, CLEARLY IT'S MARFANS AND AN AORTA ANYRESUME IS IMPENDING. 

I posted in a marfans group and they're all telling me to calm down, but Dr. google is whispering ""aorta anyresume"" and ""patients diagnosed early have the best prognosis, uh oh two months is sooooo far what could happen between then and now?"" ""Here's a story of someone who didn't get diagnosed, and whoops they DIED, if only they had been more cautious!""

I'm losing my appetite, and I'm afraid I'm going to drive everyone away with this behavior. Death consumes me. Even if they told me he'll live to seventy I'll be thinking, ""oh my god I will live out my retirement alone I can't handle this."" Dr. Google is consuming me, now I'm worried my dad and aunt have it too and my friend's boyfriend. I'm worrying over every skinny tell person I know and spiraling into my lifelong phobia of anyresumes.

Thanks for listening to my rant."
Anxiety,Advice for long time anxiety sufferer,[removed]
Anxiety,I've found out the mysterious cause of my anxiety,"Nobody can have anxiety out of nowhere. I didn't have a clear cause to my constantly anxious mindset.

Recently I accidentally came across the connection of anxiety to autism spectrum disorder. I looked up the symptoms, and I was shocked - I related to a lot of the symptoms mentioned. I felt like I could never ever have something like autism, turns out it was the huge root of my shy/quiet behavior. So it turns out I have undiagnosed ASD which is causing my inadequate anxious responses to everything.

Whenever I try to do things that require a lot of mental effort and socializing, I'm crushed by anxiety. I force myself into normal conversations. The only natural urge I get to talk about is my special interest.

Everyday I have to put a mask on. I'm a completely different person behind it. Can't really trust any other way of living, I've become a chameleon that has mastered to act normal to be accepted.

You can't even imagine what it feels like to realize that you've insulted bunch of people unintentionally or getting manipulated because you can't say 'no'. If you're a neurotypical person, you should be grateful. 

If you're a neurotypical person, you should be grateful. Have a great week!"
Anxiety,School breathing techniques,"Sometimes at school I get upset and rather shaky/fidgety, so I was wondering if anyone had any tips?"
Anxiety,Terrified of a place?,"I think I might be terrified of my martial arts studio. I've been going for almost fourteen years, but I have no close friends there and I feel unable to talk to anyone, even those I've been around for more than ten years. I've constantly tried to break out of my bubble by squeezing myself into group conversations, but I always feel dejected as my internalized fear of never being responded to happens over and over, thus repeating the cycle over and over. Try talking, never get response, fear accumulates, isolation, repeat. It's gotten to a point where I intentionally skip classes to minimize my encounters and only really go once every three weeks when I should be going 2-3 days a week at their expected minimum. I love the art, and the instructors themselves appreciate my company, and for those reasons I stay. It still hurts going, and it only feels like it's getting worse and worse. If you've gotten this far, I thank you very much."
Anxiety,Lonesome in my childhood bedroom,"My anxiety does this super cute thing where it clings onto something for a few weeks and will hyperfocus on one issue. Currently, the issue is me, being a twenty-something, knowing that my next step in adulthood is quite possibly finding a partner, yet I want to puke when I think about leaving my parents' home. I mean... come on... seriously?!? There are SO many things I could be devoting my time to... but instead my brain is worrying about the future??? The future that I have no control over?? The impending future that will inevitably pan out exactly how it is supposed to whether I worry about it for years in advance, or not?!?! 

Yes. Exactly that. 

I want to meet people. I know I need to . I need to socialize. The pandemic social side effects are honestly quite brutal, but I know that I need to get myself out there. But I don't want to leave my mom and dad. I love being their daughter. I think that subconsciously, I associate my parents with safety, and if I have a panic episode, I know that they are the first people I would run to. The thought of being without that is paralyzing. 

But then I get to thinking... if I want to meet people and possibly entertain a romantic partner, that by NO MEANS means I have to ""let go"" of the daughter in me. I can come home to my parents for as long as they will have me. I plan on living with them when I'm older, too (or maybe they will live with me at that point). I realize as I write this how extremely lucky I am and I never ever want to forget how important that is. 

Am I foolish for getting anxious about this? And I don't use the word ""anxious"" lightly, because in all honesty, when I think/talk/write about this, I am a complete wreck. The usual panic symptoms: sobbing, unable to catch my breath, stomach in knots... you get the point. 

I guess I just want to know if there are other people out there who feel this way? Almost feeling like you're caught between two points in life?"
Anxiety,My first prescription,"I was recently prescribed hydroxyzine in order to help my sleep anxiety and to take as needed when I’m having severe anxiety attacks. I’ve grown up with a stigma surrounding medication in my family my whole life, and while I strongly support the use of medication for anxiety, it’s hard not to be nervous just because of what I’ve grown up around. Could anyone who has taken hydroxyzine before comment their experience and if it helped just to help me gauge my experience with it and maybe make me less nervous about taking it?"
Anxiety,Driving terrifies me.,"Female in late twenties. Basically, I’m not sure why I’ve always been sooo scared of driving. It took me years to finally get a license and when I had the driving portion of the test I had to take like 2 doses of medication I was prescribed to help with my anxiety during presentations. I’m very anxious in general but not with presentations oddly. My partner convinced me to get off meds and I’ve explained to them that there’s no way I will ever drive without medication. Like I’m 100% sure I’ll die on the way somewhere and if I somehow don’t I’ll die on the way home. They just don’t understand that I’m not just “uncomfortable” driving but straight up terrified. Like, I feel like such a loser because all my friends and basically everyone drives but me. And it’s like I’m so embarrassed but I just can’t do it. And I hate that it holds me back. But I just can’t."
Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they are drunk/intoxicated when theyre not currently anxious?,"Hey everyone, i have ADHD and Anxiety/Depression. Ive had anxiety for as long as i can remember, only recently realized i was actually depressed.

I started medicating my ADHD couple months ago, and with those meds my anxiety sometimes reduced/dissapears. Now i also take and SSRI(Escitalopram) for my anxiety and my Depression.

Its really weird, i get these times when i just feel great, no anxiety wearing me down. But it makes me feel like im drunk, like im not myself. I honestly dont know if its because im experiencing a high on my meds, or if its because im so used to my anxiety dissapearing while drunk that ive just started associating a normal non-anxiety state with being intoxicated. Im anxious that i am high, and that im not acting like myself when this happens and it makes me second guess everything.

Which is anxiety...

Just wanted to vent and see if anyone else had similar experiences"
Anxiety,Need help with anxiety from opposite sex,"(20, M) I don't really know how to begin with this one, if I'm being honest it feels like maybe this issue is a stupid one but to me it has been a detriment to my happiness for years. I have major issues trying to flirt/even talk to the opposite sex and it only worsens the more interested I am in the person. I don't understand why but when I think about talking to someone I'm interested in I just get super obsessed with what I'm going to say because I don't want to look stupid, and it goes on and on until I just don't say anything and keep to myself because I feel like I have nothing good to say. I don't understand why I'm like this in this specific situation because in most other situations I'm known as a pretty fun, happy guy. But deep down I really want a relationship and to feel love with someone.. I've been told since I've been out of highschool that people who I was very interested in felt the same about me and if I had just actually worked up the courage then I could've been with them. But instead my passiveness made me single. Now I'm finding another person who I share a lot of interests with and I think they're an amazing person but I don't even know how to flirt with them because right when I start thinking about it my brain shuts down and I don't say anything. It's easier to treat everyone as friends but that's not what I want to do, I understand that if I don't make my interest clear then they won't get that I'm even interested in them but I don't fuckin know how to get past that mental block of even being able to talk, flirt, or ask them out and I want to change that ): . im really sorry if me bitching about a petty issue like this is offensive but it just hurts to want love and feel like it's impossible because im too anxious to actually pursue it"
Anxiety,How many other people get extremely anxious behind the wheel?,"I’m 20 and still don’t have my license. I feel humiliated even typing this but I want to get it off my chest. Whenever I get behind the wheel I seize up and freak out about every little thing that could go wrong. 

Hitting another car? Shit I don’t have insurance and I can’t afford to pay damages. 

Hitting a person?!?! Well shit I go to prison.

Driving 5kph under the speed limit??!? People yell at me.

I have about 40 hours of driving experience and I still feel as anxious as I did the first time I drove. There’s absolutely no way I could do my test at this rate. I really wonder how people manage to drive with no worries? Do they just not think about consequences??? 

Not having a license is seriously debilitating. And it doesn’t help when the rest of the world constantly mocks me for it. Even if I do manage to somehow pass my test I still see myself worrying about driving.

Anxiety,I freakin called after a month of debate!,"I'm so happy to finally get my queries solved! I couldn't call as fear overtook me. So, I emailed, but I never got a proper answer. Even when I tried to explain it again and again. Eventually, I got frustrated and decided to call but I kept saying ""lets do it tomorrow"" although tomorrow never came. I got tired of waiting for myself to call, so I picked up the phone, hesitated before stopping myself to overthink and call. Who knew it'd end up being so easy? 

I had no problem with calling before, but after few months of putting off to call, anxiety overtook me and I had to face the fear all over again which sucks. It's hard to keep consistency of every progress I made."

Anxiety,(trust and abandonment issues) I dropped out of highschool and everyone left like I knew they would,"I was a sophomore in highschool. I was very outgoing and expressive and nice to people. A lot of people would consider me their friend. But people think friend means someone you say hi to in the hallway, or maybe we talked once.

It doesn't matter. You're not my friend, you're a piece of shit and you're only talking to me because I say 'funny and interesting' stuff. They don't listen. I want to hear about your day, I want you to come up and give me a hug(don't say covid, just in general, okay?!??!), I want you to treat me like another person. Is that so hard? Is it so hard to talk to me? Too hard to start a conversation? Why can't you take me to lunch like all your other friends? Why do you say we're best friends when you don't make me apart of your group. You're lying, lying flake piece of shit that can never commit to plans.

That was everyone. They are all liars. I keep seeing their faces and hearing their voices, how sincere they try to sound. It's dumb, stop it. Stop lying to breathe. You don't want me around, I know, so why, WHY do you keep me around?? Get away from me. Please get out of my life. You don't love me, stop lying. Take me out to the store, let's hangout on the porch, hang out! Let's chill in the hallways. Let's work on a project together! Anything! I'm right here!

*n o t   a n y m o r e*

February came along, and I had a mental breakdown. I had this loss of mental energy to do anything. I didn't want to do anymore work. I was tired mentally. And it wasn't helped by the fact that I went to school everyday to face these people who lie when they breathe. They don't care about me. And they do love me, love to torture me. To lead me on. If I'm not in front of them then I don't fucking exist. I'm nothing. I'm completely worthless to them. I lost interest in acidemic work, and wanted to focus on myself. But the teachers saw me as defiant and making up excuses and I was just disappointing them. I didn't want to dropout, I wanted to graduate, take an animation class through the school. I wanted a senior quote, I wanted to be a good student. But I was making teachers upset. And the kids? FUCK THEM. I'm talking in circles, but they're lairs. My best friend started walking around in the morning and at lunch, so I couldn't talk to her. My attempt to get the attention of a guy I like fucking failed, and I got into a relationship with two freshman, big fucking mistake because one has this manipulative bf that follows her and the other was a fucking pervert and made me question my asexuality. I tried hanging out with some kid in one of my classes at lunch, but there were 9 other people and they are all doing their own thing. I wasn't asking for all of the attention, there was no order. There were these freshmen girls who would eat lunch for 25 minutes, and in THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING CONVERSATION would pack their shit and leave for volleyball or whatever. Why bother fucking talking to me if you're just going to leave?!

I'm low energy, so I figure we'll shit, let's just get a ged(hiset). Because what's going to keep me there, the kids? I felt like I would be abandoning them if I dropped out. But they won't miss me.

*a n d    t h e y   d o n ' t*


They have my snap and my instagram. They can message me anytime. I want people to hang out with me. No. I don't exist, not anymore. I just never fucking existed I guess. They don't talking to me, I'm nothing. If I'm not right in front of them, I don't exist. I can't cry about it on my story, they'll just go right past it. I'm gone. I'm all alone. I'm trapped and there's no one to help me because I don't exist. 

Abandonment goes both ways. Yes, I dropped out, but you still need to talk to me.

*p l e a s e   d o n ' t    l e a v e    m e   h e r e*

I want to make these people happy. Maybe it's my fault for assuming they would tell me if they're uncomfortable. Maybe I just am too loud and overbearing. I'm clingy. I don't want to lose people, and I'm fine with them hanging with other people when I'm around, sometimes I just get hyper focused on something. It's my fault I get too excited and just don't listen because I want to express my happiness. I've done this all to myself and I can't have them back. I can't go back. They'll say they miss me. If they missed me, wouldn't they say hi every once in a while? They're social, but I'm too much of a bother to be talked to. I'm sorry that they feel that way. I wish I could make them happy so they'd treat me nice and talk with me and treat me as a living person."
Anxiety,I have a pretty dreadful neck ache that's getting worse by the hour.,"A couple days ago it just hurt mildly so I figured I slept on it wrong, but it's been 3 days and it's getting worse. Simply being awake is a chore, it feels so tiring lifting my head up, but I don't want to be in bed all day. I have work, I have projects, I'm a creative person. Being bed ridden is very depressing. Is my posture going bad? will my neck permanently hurt like this. I am just so anxious that might just be the case. I feel so restricted. I asked if I could have tomorrow off because it's honestly hurting so bad that sitting up typing this is making me feel like my head is gonna fall off."
Anxiety,Resources for dealing with public speaking/interview anxiety,"Hi all,

My job recently asked me to start producing a small video podcast, interviewing figures within my industry. This is so outside my area of comfort and causes deep anxiety.

I find the stress just slowly builds up the closer the interview date comes, getting more and more intense as the hours count down on the day, and then reaching almost unbearable levels as I wait for the Zoom call to start.

I have had issues controlling my breathing, gone into full 'flight or fight' response (essentially, the urge to literally just run out of the room) and it generally just makes life unpleasant knowing I've got this thing hanging over me.

To be clear, I'm absolutely fine talking to people over Zoom (or, indeed, in person) but the fact that I know there's going to be an audience fills me with so much dread. I play over worst-case scenarios in my mind, like I can't speak or have to pretend there's a technical problem, or I'll say something stupid, or go red, or have a panic attack. It's horrible.

My question is: can you recommend resources that'd help with this? I really don't know where to start in terms of helping myself deal with the stress. It could be an online course, a book, even a form of therapy that would help.

I have some experience with CBT (self-taught from a book) and found it very helpful for depression, but I don't know if similar techniques can also be applied to combat depression.

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
Anxiety,My panic attacks have gone away but the mental stuff is worse,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a long time. I’m 23f. It’s constantly changing.

At the moment, I’m not getting physical symptoms of anxiety really. I get bad tension headaches and neck/back pain but I very rarely have an actual panic attack. Instead I’m just ruminating all day, worrying about nothing and everything. I’m scared about my routine changing now we’re coming out of lockdown. I’m not able to control my worrying. Anyone else feel this way and what can I do? I’m so exhausted with feeling like this."
Anxiety,Anxiety and Nightmares,When you're going through a bad bout of anxiety do you have dreams about the things you're anxious about? I've had non stop anxiety for the past week and I keep having nightmares about death and my son being taken from me. My flare up of anxiety started after having food poisoning last weekend. My stomach is still irritated and it's been causing me to feel anxious like something is seriously wrong with me.
Anxiety,How do people feel about their family openly sharing your anxiety with people you don't even know?,"I'd be interested to see how people with differing levels of anxiety feel about their family members openly sharing their anxiety/triggers/history with people you don't even know

My nan loves to use me as an example in any discussions, like I'm her token person with mental illness.  It p*sses me off so much because I don't want my personal struggles shared with the world! She'll happily tell people about my triggers, my anxiety attacks, and how she *thinks* I feel day to day coping with it...I just wonder if anyone else even cares about these things, because to me it's very personal"

Anxiety,convinced i’m going to die,Sorry this is very rambling and not formatted well but I’m so sick of this. About two weeks ago I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life and have convinced myself something is wrong with me and developed these ridiculously tedious compulsions and routines I need to do to not die to whatever I’ve convinced myself I have this time. I thought the time was different earlier and now I’m convinced it’s the time I’m going to die at today and I’ve received some premonition. I feel like I’m actually losing it. Ive done everything right everything I told myself to do and it still won’t just stop. I can’t even leave my room without rearranging like three different things and sometimes i can’t finish my food or even throw it away because I tell myself if I do something bad will happen I just don’t know what to do anymore I need some sort of reassurance
Anxiety,How to deal with anxiety after getting into scrapes?,"I am a clumsy person and I tend to screw up a lot and end up having severe anxiety until I figure out I am not in serious trouble. It so happens that I was scanning answers for the questions and was mistaken for copying. One of the instructors was upset and the other one understood the situation. Though I don't blame them both, my mind is racing and I am so scared and all I want is to just sleep off and not wake up until this is over. I don't know how to deal with the fact that it may or maynot have severe consequences and even if it does, I didn't indulge in malpractice and somehow defend myself despite the dubious circumstance I've found myself in. Until the upset instructor is gonna give me some kind of feedback, I am going to be dying of dread internally. I can't stay like this for ever. How to cope with this?"
Anxiety,TW RANT nothing will ever be the same,I hit my head on a chair and last night I cried scared to go to sleep because your not supposed to sleep when you get a concussion. My sister told me the only reason I have anxiety is because of my mindset and that I'm weak and she's curious and scared because she thinks I can't differentiate fact from delusions. thinking back it's funny because the conversation slowly shifted into me and both of my sisters fighting and everyone crying. They said I didn't even try to change and act normal. now I know things will not be the same and it's all my fault. I shouldn't have cried or opened my mouth. I should've just kept quiet and never spoke. The last thing my parents need is to know that everyone is fighting and now I feel numb. I don't know why I laughed when I cry it's getting bad for me. Plus my psychiatrist upped my doses for like 10 days now and I guess it didn't work. I just taint everyone and everything with my negativity and I wasted everything. It's over for me. I wish everyone would just forget about me. I am the chain and my family is drowning because of me. I hope I didn't give my family mental illness. I hate for it to be about me. I'm sorry im not getting better fast enough. I'm going to clean everything up. Make amends and thank everyone and atone in hell.

Anxiety,To the person that is hurting,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but to the person hurting - this will not last forever.

I know what it is like to feel hurt. I'm sure we can all relate to being hurt in one way or another, whether that be minor or major. I want to remind you all that you are never alone. I am so thankful for this subreddit where I can share my experiences with like-minded individuals and for them to understand really helps.

Someone close to me is hurting and I don't know why. Maybe you have someone like that at the moment as well. Maybe you don't know the reasonings behind someone's hurt, and most of the time you won't need to.

My DMs are always open on reddit for anyone to message me if they need someone to talk to. I can't promise I can give you all the answers you are looking for but I can try my best to make sure you aren't suffering alone. 

Above all, you are doing an amazing job. You've made it this far, so why give up now! Cliche I know but you were put on this earth for a reason. I'm also a Christian so I will put a bible verse here. Even if you don't believe in anything, this verse helps to know that you aren't alone, and the hurt will pass away.

 **Isaiah 41:10** ""Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.""

Light and Love :)"

Anxiety,Ghosting. Don’t understand why people do it,"It seems to be more of a thing people do now the minute something is off or they’re uncomfortable. 

I can see it being necessary if someone is mentally or physically abusive towards you and you need to protect yourself. Otherwise it’s just the cowards way out and it’s hurtful and humiliating. 

Had it done to me literally the day after someone went out of their way to tell me they want to help when they know that I had a seizure three weeks ago. This person also talked with me not that long ago about how ghosting is immature and hurtful at best. I sent them a message saying that I hope I didn’t do anything to upset them and got the read receipt and they still haven’t answered.

I don’t really want people to comment on this and give me reasons why they possibly ghosted because I can already come up with that on my own. I just need to say that if someone is overwhelmed, has their own stuff happening, is not in the mood, all that is better to hear than just radio silence."
Anxiety,I have fear of wetting myself in public,"Hello
 so i know it sound stupid but i have this overall fear that started in 2018 where i was in class and i needed to go to pee so badly but then my anxiety was like ""and if i peed myself infront of everyone "" so my bladder got worse and more tense . 
but alteast i managed to go release it in the end , but the fear persisted until today .
like it always the same problem where i go anywhere where there isnt a restroom and i feel this urge to pee to the point where it hurt because my body is so tense to it , i did test about it but it was nothing just my mental state . 
Today it no the same as it was but it still haunt my life unconsiously , rn i am in the dentist and i am worried i get the pain in my bladder even tho i just went to the bathroom at home and i didnt drink much nor eat .
 How can i deal with this fear ? ."

Anxiety,I started fluoxetine 12 days ago and feel so much worse.,"I could really use some words of encouragement right now. After countless failures with sleep medication my psychiatrist and I decided that an SSRI might improve my quality of life since it worked very well for me in the past. 


I've been taking fluoxetine for 12 days so far and everything is so much more difficult for me. Before I had no trouble getting out of bed and eating. Now I just want to lay in bed and never get up. My hunger became non-existent and I'm constantly naseous. Honestly my anxiety is much stronger now than it was before I started this medication. On top of all that I have so much difficulty reaching an orgasm and even when I succeed it's just so weak. Maybe like 1/15th of the sensation that I used to have three weeks ago. 


I know things are supposed to get better with time when it comes to ssris, but I'm really wondering why the hell did I even start taking them because it's simply derailing my life at the moment. The main reason for me to start taking this drug was the fact that excessive stress would linger on my body for days after said stressful event (affecting my sleep and digestion), but with these side effects I'm getting and the unfulfilling sexual life I think i might actually get depressed. I'm sorry if this seems like a rant but I'm just very frustrated with the whole situation."
Anxiety,Illness anxiety or something else?,"So this is my first time posting on here. I am a 30 year old, female about 5'3 140 pounds. Not a smoker. Not a drinker. Not on any medication. The only thing that I have been doing that may be a cause of my issues is excessive caffeine drinking. However, I am also a person that cares way too much about every little thing, the smallest thing can cause me stress, like a stain on the carpet, or just something stupid like that.

Over the past few months I have been having a myriad of issues including severe headaches, heart palpitations, dysesthesia, dizziness, chest pain, eye sight problems and fatigue. I have been to my general doctor multiple times, a neurologist, and an optometrist. 

This week I admitted myself to the ER twice because I thought I might be having a heart attack and I thought at the very least, they would be able to give me some insight as to what is going on with me. They didn't. I went in initially because I was having unusual chest pain. I was sent home after an ECG and blood test. I admitted myself hours later because I went into work and sitting at my computer, my heart started pounding and racing faster and harder each second for about a whole minute. Normally my palpitations are just flutters so this was very alarming to me. Again, I was sent home after another ECG and blood test.

It's incredibly frustrating. My blood tests are normal. They said I have no blood clots, no thyroid issues. And I had 0 episodes while I was at the hospital. They also did a chest x-ray that showed nothing abnormal. My blood pressure is always generally a little low so they can't even prescribe me beta blockers to help with the palps. I am still waiting on the result of the Zio patch heart monitor I wore for two weeks this past month so I was told unfortunately I will just have to be patient. 

My doctor thinks that I have depression and anxiety. I have always had anxiety from growing up with a mom who was agoraphobic. I have always been afraid of dying and simultaneously afraid of heart attacks. My anxiety got better in my early 20's and worse after I had a daughter and went through an abusive relationship that lasted about 4 years. I have a hard time believing however that all of these symptoms could be the result of high anxiety. I have dealt with anxiousness and panic attacks my entire life and never had it affected me with physical symptoms (aside from an upset stomach). My s/o thinks that it is a buildup of anxiety over the years combined with excessive caffeine drinking. I have not touched caffeine since my visit to the ER two days ago because I am terrified that awful heart racing/pounding episode will happen again. 

Sometimes I feel really relaxed and the heart palpitations start again and I just ball my eyes out because I'm so frustrated that even without anxiety I can't get rid of this. And it sucks because I am finally in a really great place in my life but I have a hard time enjoying it because I am so scared of this illness I think that I have.

I am curious if anyone has had similar anxiety issues?"
Anxiety,My friends can't see me anymore,"Recently a teacher at my school told my friends from my class to stay away from me since I am a ""bad influence"" and will only cause them harm.
I've been in this school for less than a year so she doesn't really know me (and my friends), so I don't really know why she thinks that.
 I don't really care about her opinion about me if it weren't that she told my friends parents about me and how their kids shouldn't interact with me. Now some of them aren't allowed to see me or sit next to me in class. 
I always struggled at making friends and I was a complete loner for most of my school life, things just got better at this new school but this teacher kinda shattered my hopes here.
 I'm not angry, she probably had her reasons, but I already hated myself before and she is just confirming my thoughts about being a shitty person, a shitty friend, a shitty son and whatever."

Anxiety,Is my psychiatrist gonna rat me out,"If I tell him I bang my head on stuff and scratch my skin raw is he going to tell my parents. I kind of want to die. Last night my sisters said I was weak and that I should try to be strong, flexible, and act normal &amp; that it’s all in my head. I’m sorry that I can’t get better soon enough with medication. I told them I wished I didn’t react like this to little health anxiety shit and they said saying I wish means it’s never going to happen and that you didn’t even try to get better. They said we help you and now you have to help us. 
I can’t cry in front of them or shit like this will happen. I’m so tired. I want to speak to my psychiatrist and open up more. Every time I leave the psychiatrist I feel like he might be overprescribing pills. But I don’t know. I want to kill myself because maybe it’s true. I am so weak and I don’t wanna go through pain all for what? I’m perfectly healthy except mentally I guess and plus the psychiatrist didn’t even say I have anxiety I bet he talks behind my back that’s why he increased the dosage I don’t know why I have to keep living anymore. I feel bad for my parents and my 3 dogs that I love with all my heart. I know my sisters will take good care of my parents in the future when they are old. But I am taking my dogs with me because it was me who begged them to get a dog."
Anxiety,How do I make friends when I work and school from home,"Hi there.

Since my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in August 2019 I have had a hard time making and keeping friends. My existing friends slowly one by one lost touch with me and it makes me feel like I am such a horrible and terrible person that no one wants to stick around to support me.

I am a 20 year old university student. School is online right now and I work for a call centre from home.

I don’t know how to make friends. The only people I hang out with are my family and my boyfriend. I think my current situation was just too heavy for my friends to handle and even upon reaching out to my best friend of 14 years who I stopped taking to, she didn’t want to rekindle our friendship because she said she is happy with the way her life is right now. I wish I could say the same.

Obviously with the pandemic I can’t really go out much (Ontario just got put into a province-wide lockdown).

I tried Bumble BFF and can’t keep a friendship going for more than maybe a week tops.

How do you make friends in your 20s? I have been struggling so much. I just want a girl friend to talk to and rely on. It’s so hard. My GAD is as bad as it’s ever been and I am so lonely despite my boyfriend and family (family has also been so hard to deal with and I am planning on moving out as soon as I can but it’s been difficult).

Please help. Or just give some encouraging stories of you getting out of friendless slumps."

Anxiety,Weird crawling sensation,"Hi guys. 

So I’ve been suffering from anxiety and dp/dr for some time now and all the while been experiencing one particular symptom I can’t explain.

I sometimes feel a tingling sensation on my feet that feels almost as though a microscopic mite or bug may be crawling on (or just under the surface) of my skin. This sensation is usually brief, around a second. But it can happen multiple times. 

I also occasionally get patches on my scalp which feel irritated and like the hairs are being moved or as though I have head-lice (I have checked, and I don’t). 

I have no obvious medical cause so I was wondering if this might be something related to the physical symptoms of anxiety. Please let me know if any of you also have this or a better explanation. Thanks :)"

Anxiety,Anxiety around driving,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone else could relate to this. I’m 23 next week, and I still can’t drive. I’ve sat 1 test back in 2017, ended up crying and having a panic attack during it and obviously failing and have since put off doing another test. I’ve done all my compulsory lessons and just got my new learners permit. Where I’m from, is a really rural area where generally you need to drive, so a lot of times people would have been driving growing up without a license and when it came time to take the test, they already knew how to drive. It wasn’t like this for me. My parents were really unhelpful with the whole teaching me how to drive, my mother refused point blank to sit in the car with me, and jd have to ask my dad about 10 times to even get an hour a week. They wouldn’t let me practice in the car without them either. 

My partner has a car and drives, and he is brilliant and I know he will be happy to help me. I know how to drive, it’s just if I make even a small mistake il just completely shut down and start panicking. But I was wondering, does anyone else feel like this, or have had little help/ lessons even though you feel like everyone is judging you coz you don’t drive? It’s such a big thing for me I feel like such a failure because of it :("
Anxiety,Is this anxiety? everyone thinks so (I don’t),"My problem started back in February, a nerve pain Im assuming shot down from my back to my legs. My bowel movement hasn’t been the same since this happened I’ve been constantly constipated. I’ve developed terrible lower back pain throughout the month of February, but it got a lot better towards the end. During this month I’ve also started feeling random nerve firings, also developed a slight sharp pain under my left breast (upper rib cage). 

Now in March I started to feel the slight sharp pain under left breast more often, then it seemed to leave a inflamed feeling right along the ribs. For a week in March I felt very week like my arms and legs especially behind my knees. I also started to see floaters , blurred vision, pain behind the eyes, and cant look up in the sky some days. Those events made me go make an optometrist appointment and he told me my eyes are perfectly fine. I’ve also been having slight pressure in my temples, but recently it seemed like its radiating to the front of my scalp. 

My CT scan of the abdominal and pelvic region came back clean besides constipation/fecal impaction. My bloodwork also came back fine. Behind my knees, elbows, and upper part of the arm seemed to be the key points thats aching. My neck also gives a nerve type flare sometimes and when I look up the back of neck aches very bad. It feels like I get random nerve firing in different areas especially my back."

When I drive, I'm okay, a bit stressed, but not as bad as just thinking of it"
Anxiety,Surprised by trigger on date last night. Venting; Mild trigger warning for menacing/stalking,"(Apologies for mobile formatting)

I was on a first date last night. He was good-looking and things were going pretty well. I got up to go to the bathroom and came back to the table. We started talking again, and he suddenly indicated one of the female servers (not our server) and said that he'd made pretty intense eye contact with her while I was in the restroom and he wanted to do it again and creep her out. 

I just froze, and immediately flashed back to when I had worked as a server and there was this one man who used to come in and ask me out, like, follow me around the restaurant while I was serving other people. 

Anyway, I told my date that I didn't think that was funny at all. He basically scoffed at me saying, even if bad things happened to me, they didn't happen to her, which made me even angrier because of the unwanted attention and harassment women have to deal with on a daily basis, especially in service jobs. I had to go outside for a minute to calm down.  I got our waiter and paid our bill, because I wanted to leave. 

He didn't seem to think he had done anything wrong, but he did stop trying to mess with her; it seemed obvious that I wasn't going to change his mind and he certainly wasn't going to change mine.  He really wanted to pursue the subject (he is a therapist, if that matters), but he also didn't want me to leave. I told him to change the subject and he did, and the conversation lightened up again, but the trust was lost."
Anxiety,Is this job as bad as I think it is or is my anxiety overblowing it?,"I can’t help but feel like everyone here really dislikes me.

I feel like I’ve been given no direction but have been told “there’s plenty of stuff to do” when I was standing behind the register but haven’t been told exactly what to do. 
I feel like everyone is watching me and waiting for me to do something stupid so they can make fun of me internally. 
I tried to talk to my coworkers like “Hey did you see all the tiny Buddha statues someone donated, how strange” and she just shut me down like “I was here when we got them.” 
I keep getting told to do one thing like “ring that up this way” but than got told off for ringing it up that way and to do it this way. 
I can’t seem to chill out no matter how I try I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I feel like I’m tightrope walking on a panic attack."
Anxiety,Anxious about meeting my parents' expectations after graduation,"I'm about to graduate college and I'm terrified.  I have anxiety but since I got on Lexapro a year ago it hasn't been too bad.  But I've been more anxious in the last couple weeks, and it's been building up and getting worse.  I graduate in the middle of May.  When it turned April my anxiety got ramped up because I knew the date of my graduation is getting closer.

After I graduate, I'm going to move into my boyfriend's apartment.  My parents know this and have discussed it, and they're ok with it but they don't like it.  I come from a conservative family and I know they are going to think I'm living in sin especially my dad (even though they lived together before they were married).  One of my big anxiety triggers is my parents having anything to do with my personal life and their judgement of me.  There's so much they don't know about me that I hide from them so they don't judge me.  In the past I worried more about losing their financial support, but now that I'm graduating, I won't have their financial support anyways.  So now I'm just worried about their harsh judgement.

I work for the school so my employment ends when I graduate.  I am looking for a summer job that will be near my boyfriend's house. (In the fall I will start working on starting my career).  I have mentioned to my mom I guess I will be moving into my boyfriend's current apartment when I graduate, and then when his lease runs out we'll find a new place.  Honestly I don't even know what my alternative would be if I wasn't moving in with him.  I don't know where I'd even go.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but it just seems like this is what's most likely to happen.  I'm worried something is going to not work out and I won't find a job, and my parents will yell at me for being irresponsible. 

I'm just so scared that my parents are going to come down on me one last time and give me their judgement before I'm financially independent from them and they can't say anything anymore.  I'm worried they're going to invade my privacy, judge me, and criticize my choices.  They're on their way to my apartment for easter right now and I'm just very anxious and scared thinking about seeing them and the future."

My OCD has always been a sexual issue.  

These days, I was watching a live game and there was a scene in which some bad children kidnapped another child.  

Immediately, I had a bad feeling and I remembered other times when I had this: seeing children being mean and feeling really bad. 

However, my OCD tells me that I actually felt aroused.  

Trying to remember some time in childhood when I felt aroused by something bad (like a kidnapping) I remembered a time when I watched Tinker Bell and coincidentally in a scene that she was kidnapped, I waited for something sexual to happen (I  was around 9 years old).  

But the expectation that something sexual would happen, came at various times and there was not necessarily something bad in between... 

Well, someone told me that I can have a fetish in kidnapping, which makes me very upset and very disgusted.  I really hate anything that involves aggression and everything.  

But the question is, do you think this is just the OCD acting or can I really have a fetish?  

Assuming that yes, remembering that, even though the feeling has nothing to do with anything sexual or pleasurable, I remembered that when I saw CHILDREN being mean.  Does that make me a pedo? I get so sick of it, god.  i hate pedophilia, i hate sexual assaults and i am an activist against pornography.

Ps: the feeling when seeing the scene on the live was very bad;  I've had this feeling before and it was also very bad, it's like a mixture of disgust and anger."
Anxiety,My anxiety is debilitating today. I just want it to pass.,"I have dealt with anxiety for 25 years. I have good days and bad days. Today, is a very tough day. I have no energy to do anything, I feel that fight or flight panic through my whole body. I just wanna curl up in a ball and disappear. But, I have 4 kids that need me to function. I just wish this would pass already. Thanks for letting me vent.."
Anxiety,Hydroxyzine Hangover,"Vistaril Hangover???

I took 25mg of vistaril last night because I have been trying to cut back on my melatonin intake and thought I’d give it a try to get some good sleep. Dumb idea. I am moving today and I have NO energy. I feel disgusting. I feel like I took 10 Benadryl’s. Any ideas how to get this to go away? Will chugging water help? I am falling asleep moving furniture 😂"
Anxiety,I finally went outside and had a good time!,"I took a shower today (the second time this week and I know to some this is the usual but I struggle so bad with self care, that I feel immensely proud of me), I brushed my teeth (which I struggle with a lot), didn't forget to take my meds, dressed up nice and put makeup, ate an actual lunch my mom made AND I FINALLY WENT OUTSIDE!!

I went on a small walk to the park near my home with my mom and it was great!! The sun was warm and the wind felt nice on my face, had a bottle of water with me, was listening to music, saw couple cute dogs and I was feeling really good about myself! I was so anxious and kinda terrified about going but I actually went and I had a really nice time, I even took some good pictures of me!

I feel kinda tired now and I don't know how I'll be feeling tomorrow but today was an absolute win and no one can take that away from me 💜 Take that dumb anxiety and depression, I got the feeling good chemicals today"
Anxiety,Symptoms and Emotional Wear,"I have had an anxiety disorder that was diagnosed for around a year and a half. I have been an anxious person my whole life. Because of my anxiety, I have IBS like symptoms, that are very painful and can ruin my days. This also feeds into the classic anxiety cycle of events that make you more anxious.

Over time, I have really started to notice the emotional wear these symptoms leave on me. It is hard to get out of bed because of stomach aches. I spend hours in the bathroom. I take anti-diarrheal pills every day. This just sucks, really bad. i'd like to feel ok for once."
Anxiety,Tingling sensations,"One of the worst anxiety sensations that I have is random tingling sensations in my feet, arms, and face. It’s so annoying. I started a medication for anxiety 3 weeks ago, so it could be from that still, but it’s still so uncomfortable. Anyone else?"
Anxiety,ah work anxiety...,"work anxiety is the worst, because you can rarely every get rid of the trigger. i work three days in a row starting today and id love if any of you would be open to chatting to help calm my nerves. my work anxiety has gotten so bad recently and i havent been able to tell my parents...tips? advice? any support is very very welcomed.."
Anxiety,Panic feel my heart is about to burst,Need help or just need to know what to do so today it my niece birthday we are going to have small get together. That not the issue the problem is where the party is being held at. I had know idea but the place is the house of a girl who I like and confess but thing didn’t go well and this person scared me. Now my heart is beating nonstop and I want just run run non stop. It been over 8-9 years since I saw or had any contact with her now just finding out I have be there all my old wounds came up.
Anxiety,Feeling anxious and afraid all the time,"Everything I (20F) do or say must be done perfectly. I am a huge perfectionist my whole life, but lately, I want everyone to think that I am perfect. I am very frustrated and always analyze everything, especially after saying something wrong in front of someone. I am afraid of other's opinions to the point that I just want to dissapear. I am always worried and make the worst scenarios in my head.

Recently, I started to be so negative and annoying that I cannot stand myself, and feel sorry for people around me. Despite the fact that everything is going well in my life (pleasant family, likable boyfriend, regular college student), I always strive to be better and care too much about my appearance.

Any advice how to stop my mind, live in the moment and be more relaxed around others?

Thanks in advance :)"
Anxiety,Does anybody else have a constant tingling sensation in their chest/throat area?,"No matter what time of day it is or what I'm doing I almost always usually have a constant tingling sensation close to pins and needles throughout my chest and throat area. 

Sometimes at night when I'm trying to sleep, it'll feel like someone has just pricked me in the neck with a needle really quickly and I'll jolt awake. 

Anybody else in the same boat?"
Anxiety,Random “What am I doing with my life” thoughts,"I’ll be having a normal chilled day and then it pops up.


I genuinely don’t know how it comes and what can I do about it."
Anxiety,"Yesterday was my third day on Zoloft 25mg, last night I felt really lightheaded and I woke up today with a headache and feeling the same way. I feel high is this normal?",
Anxiety,What's the absolutely hardest part of managing anxiety?,"From reading the many posts here, I can tell everyone is trying hard to manage anxiety. And many do an amazing job! Among all the challenges, barriers and limitation that come with anxiety, what really is the absolutely hardest par of managing anxiety? Anyone willing to share?"
Anxiety,"I had anxiety as my diagnosis for the longest time, now it changed to BPD, and it has been hard.","For years I was told my new therapists/psychiatrists that I had generalized anxiety disorder. Well, I just got diagnosed with BPD and it’s already getting used against me

My therapist diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder (BPD) a couple days ago. I told my family and significant other. I thought they would be supportive, and also just wanted to share that.

My family now tells me I am “splitting” whenever someone genuinely upsets me, and my significant other would say the same thing. He also told me when I was upset that it’s my “BPD acting up”

I didn’t think they were going to define me by this. It feels extremely bad."
Anxiety,Voice messages,"Sometimes when I’m talking to my friends who are from other countries, we’ll be typing to each other and then they may respond with a voice message. I think this is common place where there from but I’m not too used to it, and I find myself not able to respond without thinking of what I’m going to say and then it becomes too rehearsed and just feels fake and wrong. I feel like they sent the message as a voice note for a reason, maybe just to hear my voice or whatever but I can’t bring myself to respond with one. Is it rude to respond with a typed message to a voice note?"
Anxiety,Does getting your tubes tied increase your anxiety?,
Anxiety,Don't underestimate the influence of your diet,"I recently have been butting heads with my psychiatrist about this a bit. I was convinced that I may have an underlying issue to my anxiety that my meds were just ""masking"". For context I find that my anxiety is closely related to my gut health, and the fact that a lot of medications mess around with gut health always bothered me. After keeping track of my diet for a while I've noticed that I am very likely lactose intolerant, and am probably gluten intolerant as well. I cut both bread and dairy out of my diet for the last couple of weeks and started to feel a lot better (initially I cut dairy out and saw some improvement but I still had problems, that's when I decided to cut out gluten as well and saw even more improvement). Then last night eating dinner with my parents I all of a sudden feel my anxiety start to spike and start feeling really unwell. Turns out what we were eating was breaded with a thin layer of flour to give it a nice crisp coating. Going to be making a doctor appointment with a GP to confirm my suspicions.  


If you're struggling with anxiety and it seems to randomly flare up I highly recommend you examine what you're putting into your body that might be causing problems for you. Whether it's processed sugar, caffeine, dairy, gluten, excessive amounts of salt/fats, or something else, keeping track of your body's fuel might help give you some answers. It's probably not going to be a cure all for you, but it might help smooth things out and make your life a bit easier."
Anxiety,fear somethings wrong with me (18F),"back in january i went through one of the toughest months of my life. it was the worst thing I had ever experience, so many personal problems and much stress due to school led me to have terrible anxiety and it led to me suffering constant chest and shoulder pains which lasted for days. i was terrified, but i had been diagnosed with anxiety before and had taken anxiolytics (lorazepam). In January I ran out of them and I got sent to a psychiatrist, told him my symptoms with chest pain and he told me it was because of my anxiety and prescribed me with the same anxiolytics, but I currently don’t have them anymore.
In February I moved to another place and found myself being way more calm and happier, hadn’t had any chest pain in a month and was content, but I started to get anxious about my physical health. Everything was a reason for me to be worried, I got paranoid out of anything and googled my symptoms all the time, and it was always nothing to worry about but I couldn’t convince my mind it was nothing. 

Long story short, one day I was having a pretty bad day and got anxiety at night. I got a tough chest pain which freaked me out, it was hard to breathe and I got a random urge to cry out of nowhere. It lasted for a few days then stopped. Everything went back to normal, I was fine and had no problems until today… I saw a post of a girl which explained her brother had died of a heart attack and doctors always told him it was anxiety and didn’t care. Once I read it my whole body just froze and I started to get the most paranoid I had ever gotten. I told my friend about it and she tried to calm me down but my mind wouldn’t let me not think about it, and I’ve been thinking about it for the whole day. This lead me to start focusing on my chest and shoulders and they started to hurt, and I got chest pain again! Wohoo. I was hanging out with friends when it happened, I couldn’t have a good time because I was so worried, I was distant and wanted to go home, I didn’t want to be there and felt an urge to cry. I was nervous and so paranoid, couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got back home it got worse because I tried to sleep but couldn’t, I couldn’t stop focusing on the pain, I couldn’t stop remembering the post I had read and I started to have trouble breathing and began crying a lot out of the fear, I got so so overwhelmed and so worried about my health I couldn’t help but to cry desperately. Has this ever happened to anyone else?"
Anxiety,Having anxiety from social media,"Does anyone else get nervous from just posting something or writing a comment? I've heard from many people that communicating online is much easier for them than in person, but I'm not like that. Almost all the time when I make a comment somewhere I'm shaking and sweating, and if people don't agree with my opinion, I'll be embarrassed and think about it for days. Even getting downvoted on Reddit gives me a rush of adrenalin and makes me want to delete whatever got downvotes. Is anyone in a similar situation? Thanks for reading (and sorry for my english lol)"
Anxiety,It's so hard making friends.,"Not only do I feel anxious when approaching someone new, but also anxious the entire relationship, worrying that they'll leave me because of how boring and annoying I get. And honestly it sucked cuz I am the one who'd always have to start the conversation, meaning that it's almost impossible for me to have friends."
Anxiety,Antihistamines worth trying?,Does anyone else get an anxiolytic effect from Claritin (loratadine)? It makes me wonder if Atarax would be a good med for me to try since it’s also an antihistamine. Any responses are appreciated.
Anxiety,"Dear brain, I am DONE letting you and anxiety rule my life",I’ve been having panic attacks since I was 6. I’m almost 23. Anxiety has been a constant force in my life and has rarely successfully served its actual purpose. That ends TODAY. I don’t care how anxious something makes me. I don’t care how badly I’m going to feel like I’m dying. I don’t CARE. I’m taking your fucking power away and I’m doing it now.
Anxiety,How do you cope with post conversation anxiety?,"Trigger warning, maybe? 
Almost everyday I have at least one conversation I just cannot stop thinking and criticizing myself about. I've had anxiety attacks just thinking about them and no matter what I tell myself, I still feel like such an idiot/screw up about everything."
Anxiety,How do I stop comparing myself?,"I’ve had anxiety since my childhood (I’m 30) i think my anxiety is ruining my life. I have no career, I work dead end jobs that leave me depressed and my friends and family are all doing better than I am..I just learned my cousin got an amazing job and is pregnant finally, my friend got married to a wealthy man and hardly speaks to me anymore..I just am weighed down by depression and anxiety. I was on lexapro but the side effects weren’t good so I got off. I have no health insurance for therapy. I guess I’d like some advice, ways to not compare myself to everyone. I am tired of feeling like this😞"
Anxiety,are meds not worth the trouble?,"ive recently recovered from a negative side effect from my second anxiety med. last night i rushed to the hospital with a 150 bpm and luckily was able to sit outside without going in till i recovered.. but it still took me 5 hours just to get back to a HIGH normal.  there was a month in between when i was able to handle it all on my own. my heart rate during anxiety attacks would never go higher than 110 and was usually 101 at its worst. i still had days in between when i obsessed over my health and my body felt filled with anxiety but as soon as i started taking these meds it felt like i just reset on all my progress. i actually went in to the ER this morning cause my bp was too low for me at 57ish still completely healthy just not used to being healthy  


should i just tell my doc i can handle well enough on my own, or keep searching for a solution?  


 to be completely honest im looking for anxiety meds i can take for a few months while HOPEFULLY i get back to normal after a head injury. and then come right back off of them."
Anxiety,A Long Road,"2021 has been overall terrible for me. From the get go.  It started with me getting abdominal pain under my left ribs. It eventually became worse with joint pain. I eventually went to the ER and got a CT scan after constantly being anxious about it for days. They did blood work as well. They said nothing was wrong and it didn’t go away. From there I got more symptoms of pelvic pain, ear pain, jaw pain, burning when peeing, testicle swelling, rib cracking, Nausea, the list goes on and on. I kept going to the hospital at least six separate times from early January till January 20 something. My birthday was me on the ground writhing in pain after throwing up my sushi and freaking out. Eventually the day after my birthday I got a call from one of the hospitals that I had Lyme disease. I began doxycycline and still doubted that’s what it was and over the next 4-7 weeks was getting better eventually having almost no symptoms. After the seven weeks I went off of doxycycline. My anxiety was down I was talking with a therapist about coping skills, I started skiing and working out. A few days after the doxycycline ended. I began worrying intensely about my heart. Worried it was to low at night constant checking it. Then I went to the cardiologist and everything was normal. I’m still waiting on my echocardiogram though. I then got this terrible headache that lasted for three days off and on with jaw pain. I began having shortness of breath. Got a Covid test and it was negative. Got a CT scan of my brain and it was normal. Got an x ray of my lungs it was normal. I’ve gone completely backward and barely eat always depressed scared I’m dying from anything from a PE to ALS (because my leg muscles twitch). All of these things are things that can be explained. But I have shortness of breath that comes and goes. Ear ringing that started after I had a sharp pain in my lower back which I’m certain is from my cervical spine being out alignment which I was going to a doctor for months ago. And it was out of alignment which would explain the terrible headaches. Or the anxiety explains that. Anyway. I guess the whole point is I don’t know how to feel. This whole thing has been an incredible strain on my relationship with my family and girlfriend and I don’t know what to choke up as anxiety and not. Is it possible to have shortness of breath despite not actively panicking? All my O2 levels were normal. Every time I have some little thing happen I immediately think I’m dying from some stupid nonsense. It’s draining."

Anxiety,Stuck on what to do :/,"Hi, I’m 14 years old and 99% I have some sort of anxiety disorder. I have heaps of the ‘typical’ symptoms and get panic attacks every week or sometimes more often. I’ve told my parents (both in the past two days actually) and my dad who also suffers from anxiety is booking me into the local GP to get a ‘test’ done (not sure if this is what happens everywhere, but it’s basically a checklist type of thing where they ask questions and give a score at the end). However, my parents are both under the impression that my anxiety is not very bad (mostly because of my age) and that it isn’t affecting me much when it actually is, particularly the fact that I make excuses to stay inside all day, I cannot talk in front of people etc. which they don’t seem to realise is making my life much worse. I’ve told them it’s worse than they think but it doesn’t make a difference. Because of this, they want me to try therapy. I’m not 100% sure what therapy entails, however I know I will need to be open and talk to the therapist and as I mentioned I am terrible at talking to people. I also have a feeling any type of therapy isn’t going to work - that ‘gut feeling’. I’ve tried many things myself without a doctor, therapist etc such as meditation and mindfulness but none of these help, especially when I have panic attacks or anything related to social anxiety. My point is, I’m extremely sure that therapy won’t work but my parents are extremely against me trying medication (not sure why, considering my dad is treated this way). I don’t know anything about medication, or whether it will work or not, but I’m just sick of feeling like this all the time and don’t want to waste time with therapy."
Anxiety,Unable to talk after anxiety attacks/moments of anxiety?,"I've had anxiety attacks for a few years and afterwards it's always extremely difficult to talk. It feels like it takes so much more energy, or like I'm surrounded in a protective bubble that I have to pop by talking. Usually I have to make myself talk so I can explain to whoever is around me what's going on and how they can help. 

A couple times over the past few weeks I've had a couple occasions where I got anxious around my boyfriend (not due to something he did), and I typed on my phone to show him that I was okay but couldn't really talk. I was still able to interact with him, but it was easier to fully recover by not being pushed to speak. I've never been able to do this before and it's a lot less pressure to take as much time as I need until I'm able to talk again. 

Has anyone else experienced this?"
Anxiety,need major surgery,"support post i need major surgery soon i have autism, adhd, deplomental delays, speech and learning issues, sensory issues i have flat feet asthma allergies i will be having surgery in a few months the surgery that will be done is pharyngeal flap surgery  sinus surgery and  cleft palate surgery too  on the day of surgery i have too get a picc line  put in  , than in the afternoon that day im going too get liquid versed  i hope it doesn't taste too bad  will the anesthesia mask in the operating  room  smell bad,  will the icu room after surgery be scary , will i need ivs  too  and oxygen or ng tubes or catheters will the hoisptal  require me too wear diapers  im ok if they do  ,  any support is needed"

Anxiety,Does anyone else get too focused on their breathing to the point where they feel like they can't breathe?,
Anxiety,A job misstep caused significant anxiety and I’m having trouble getting back on track,"I’ve suffered anxiety most of my life, but didn’t label it as anxiety until my late 30s with the help of my doctor.

I was laid off a few months before the pandemic and used that time to take contract jobs and learning some new skills to pivot to a new field. I accepted a job last November and it was just a nightmare. Demanding, stressful and with very little training. I tried the fake-it-until-you-make-it mentality, but I’m no good at that. I’m also rather introverted and the position was for more of an extrovert. The pay was the highest I’ve ever reached.

During this job I lost over seven pounds and could barely sleep. I was becoming a shell of my former self.

I talked with my SO and we agreed this couldn’t continue, so I put in my notice after four months. 

Since being done with this job, I
Immediately began interviewing for jobs in the new field, but the interviews are giving me anxiety. I do need a job. I finally was offered a job doing what I did before the pandemic. It’s not high paying, they wouldn’t budge on salary when I pressed for just a little higher. So I accepted.

I feel like a failure so late in my career. I wanted to go in this new direction and I fell on my face. I feel like I can’t do any job, that I can’t make a decent wage and that I’ve just really failed. I also feel like I’m incapable of doing any job.

I have very little enthusiasm about my new job. I’m not excited (used to get a little excited with new jobs) and really just not motivated. 

I’ve been trying to reframe how I’m viewing this new job - I only need to work three years and then I can retire early.  I’m viewing it as a stepping stone to retirement. And I’ll be honest that I’m not planning to go above and beyond in this job. 

I feel resentment, disappointment, ashamed, and, well, like I can’t hack it. I’m also having a lot of anxiety about leaving the house. I force myself out, but if I’m not with my SO or a family member, my anxiety skyrockets and I have to go home.

Any suggestion to help my anxiety come down and alleviate these feelings? I do see a doctor regularly to discuss my mental state, but I can’t quite shake this. My anxiety has ebbed and flowed in the past. Right now it’s been constant the last month and a half. I feel like a squeezed out sponge - drained, nothing to offer and ready for the trash.

Thanks for any suggestion."
Anxiety,Breathe,"Take a step back. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out.

It's going to be okay. You might not feel okay now, but you will in time. I promise.

Anxiety is something that can be managed, and you can do it. I know you can. 4 seconds in, 4 seconds out.

I wish you all luck and positivity :)"
Anxiety,Anxiety getting worse,"I’m 22 and i was prescribed Propranolol a few years ago and told by my doctor to take them when I feel my anxiety getting worse so I would take on average about 2-3 a day all depending. I came off them because I was feeling better, now a few years down the line my anxiety is at it’s worst I literally feel terrible all the time. I don’t know if I should go to the doctors again I’m ashamed it makes me feel like I’m not a man."
Anxiety,how did you know you have anxiety?,"Hello all! I’m new to the topic of anxiety and mental health so please redirect me if i’m in the wrong sub. 

I’ve been having a really rough time with mental health lately, and I think I might have anxiety. But I can’t tell if I actually have an anxiety disorder. Is there a way that I can tell? Did anybody just “know” that you had anxiety? 

I ask this because I’m trying to figure out if I should see a professional or not, my family tells me I’m just stressed from school (very difficult and fast-paced engineering curriculum) but none of the people I know seem as stressed as me. I have a ton of work and I’m a slow and meticulous worker so I’m always freaking out about stuff at the last minute. I have a mental health app on my phone and I’ve identified that I catastrophize and focus on worst-case scenarios instead of the actual situation, or I get so fixated on a situation (often that hadn’t even happened and has little indication of happening) to the point where I feel physically sick. Sorry if this is gross but I’ve picked at the skin on my lips and scalp as a nervous habit that’s so bad it bleeds on a near-daily basis. I also went from being a daily coffee drinker to not even being able to have half a cup because it gives me the shakes. 

Should I see a professional, or is it just school anxieties? Over the summer I’m not stressed at all, I just turn into an entirely different person during the school year which is why my parents say it’s normal and nothing to be worried about. My family also has a lot of stigma around mental health. I have a relative with depression and every time she’s even remotely sad or tired they tell her to “go take her crazy pills” and just completely invalidate her, and I don’t want to be treated that way.

Anyways, back to my original question - did you “know” when you had anxiety, or how do I differentiate it from just being stressed about school?"
Anxiety,Can anyone relate to feeling like they’ve developed some form of mild agoraphobia after the last year+ ?,"I got laid off last year due to the pandemic and have not seen anyone other than outdoor get togethers when possible. I live with my partner and we have been extremely cautious as one of us is immunocompromised. As an anxious person, I’m surprised at how well I have handled the craziness of this all. I’m a social person, I love my family/friends, and I love traveling... but I feel like I’m going crazy when I talk to someone and hear them mention how excited they are to start seeing people soon. I feel like the past year of not working, not seeing many people, and being afraid that anyone who comes near me could have Covid has really done a number on me. Anytime I mention this to loved ones, I’m met with judgement that makes me feel as if this is abnormal and means there is something wrong with me."
Anxiety,“Organising” my life? I feel lost,"Hello everyone! Advice is not just needed, it’s very very needed! I am apologising in advance for any mistakes throughout this post, I am not a native speaker, I am “self taught” in English. 

A little background first. I am a 24 year old girl. A few years ago I was diagnosed with panic disorder. Most of the time I can manage it pretty well (I don’t take any medications since two years ago) but I have those periods in which it “hits” me and it gets difficult. The way in which my anxiety is manifesting is that I get really unmotivated. When in periods with elevated anxiety, I get physical symptoms and some weird fear that if I get up from the couch and start doing something I’ll make it worse. Combined with COVID and having to stay at home, it really messed up my life and made me the most passive I’ve ever been.

The majority of the last year I didn’t really do anything. I know it sounds horrible, but most of my days were spent on the sofa browsing social media and watching TV. I kind of abandoned all my goals. 

- I am now writing my graduate thesis project. I really fell behind with that missing two deadlines. 

- Started a freelance job in my field of study 5 months ago but I catch myself doing the bare minimum and in response - not making enough money. 

- Abandoned the new language I was studying. 

- Almost completely ditched my hobby as well - I have that account in which I post photos made and edited by me. Not in a professional way, I don’t make any money from that. It just makes me feel relaxed. I used to post 2-3 times a week. Now I post 1-2 times a month.

The only things I am proud of myself for are that I stopped smoking and started working out again. 

I occasionally go to therapy and my therapist is certain that the way to keep my anxiety under control is to have a purpose and stick to it. The thing is that I don’t know where to start when my life was basically on hold for the last year or so. I feel so far behind that I am kind of discouraged that I can “get back on track”. 

My fiancé is really supportive towards me, but I don’t think he can fully understand as he has never battled with anxiety, which is completely normal. He knows that I struggle sometimes and is doing the best that he can. Still sometimes I feel like I’m letting him down for not doing anything significant, which makes me feel even more lost if that makes sense. 

I really want to change. But it’s like I have so many things to fix that I don’t know where to start and what to do. I need guidance. Really any advice will be so much appreciated right now."
Anxiety,Constantly exhausted,"Ok so I’ve posted here before about a mental breakdown I had not too long ago. In terms of that I’m doing way better and my mental health is pretty good in my terms. 

I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time so I’ve had my fair share of late nights and tired, lazy days. 

This is different. 

For months on end now I’ve been dealing with problems related to my focus and productivity, just cause I can’t find any motivation to do my school work or study ever. I’ve progressed a bit but I’m still finding it challenging. I’ve taken vivance recently and that seems to help get shit done but I don’t wanna start relying on that cause it wouldn’t be healthy. Though, one of the biggest problems recently is my constant exhaustion. 

I’m fucking tired ALL the time. 

It’s been about half a year or so now and it never ends. I’m either completely exhausted to the point where I could fall asleep at any moment if I tried, feeling can’t do anything and just not wanting to do anything, or just tired where I can do stuff but I’m still not motivated. 

It’s hard to describe the state I get into throughout the day but I could only explain it as being awake yet my mind being half asleep. It even affects my vision, things are starting to seem blurred, yet I have very good vision. 

Ive tried sleeping for a longer amount of time and sleeping for a less amount of time and neither has done anything. I get 6 hours a night, and I’m tired all day. I get 8 hours a night, and I’m tired all day. 

This adds to my focus/productivity challenges. I haven’t been diagnosed but my family/friends are pretty sure I have ADHD, it’s bad to assume things tho it’s probably just my anxiety. 

I’m so fucking confused to the point where I can’t find anything that helps.

I got a good nights sleep last night and have had two coffees today and yet IM FUCKING EXHAUSTED. Its 4 in the fucking afternoon and I feel like I haven’t slept since Thursday 

I apologize for rambling/being angry but I’m so fucking frustrated at this point cause nothing works. I have so much work do to as exams and assignments are filling my schedule this month but I haven’t done any work the past 3 days cause I just can’t. 

I’ve looked up so many ways to fix this and nothing seems to work. If u read this and have any advice please let me know. I need help."
Anxiety,should I give up to medicines ?,"Hello

I've had OCD and other anxiety related disorders since I was a child, but haven't been diagnosed until 18, now I'm 24yo.

the doc that diagnosed me precsribed deanxit and citoles (Escitalopram).

I never took the meds and never visited the doc again and continued my life, until that point, I only thought I had OCD, and I fought it but it was never gone completely.

I should mention that at some point when I was 17-18, I started to have more and more stomach  problems, had a few light panic attacks but didn't know what happend at that time.

fast forward to 2019, I gradually became more and more anxious, I wake up tired everyday no matter how much I sleep, my stomach became worse  and had  a strong panic attack(I  was very anxious that day, visited a doc to diagnose me and the peak of the panic attack happened right in front of him) so I understood what was happening is a panic attack.

at this point, I never linked anxiety to my I'll stomach, until I visited a doc in 2020 to diagnose my stomach, he made me do some medical tests and everything was normal, he put his Stethoscope at my chest and he immediatly got it, he told me that anxiety is the problem and prescribed me ""Deanxit"" (he's not a psychiatrist) and I did not take any of the pills he described me.

fast forward to the last few weeks, I had a very strong panic attack that my limbs got paralyzed, I'm fighting anxiety to some extent and stop it to reach the point of a panic attack most of the time, but  my stomach is hurting more and more and I can't tolerate it anymore.

I'm note sure if should visit a psychiatrist again and give up to medicines, I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry and I'm afraid that I'll became addicted to these drugs.

what's worse, the doc will probably prescribe deanxit again, AFAIK, it's banned in a lot of countries.

&amp;#x200B;

what are your experiences with drugs, are the side effects and the possibility of becamoing an addict worth the risk ?"
Anxiety,Relationship Crippled by Anxiety/Depression,"[tl/dr] Need to help girlfriend overcome anxiety and depression so that we can build our life together.

I (31/M) need advice on how to help my girlfriend (26/F).
She has struggled with severe social anxiety and depression since high school. She has seen a therapist in the past, but she didn't keep up with it. She told me that it caused her too much anxiety even just to do that.

It keeps her from wanting to go out and do things, especially if it's with a group of people. This is all pre-Covid (although Covid, of course, makes all this worse). She needs advance notice before doing anything with friends, which eliminates being able to do anything spontaneous/spur of the moment. But whenever there is advance notice it usually means it's a bigger occasion, not just a casual hang out, so the anxiety factor spikes, and she more likely will choose not to attend. She has met my friends and they like her, and she has enjoyed herself when we've hung out with them. But she still is very reluctant to do anything if it involves a group of people. Same goes for events or just hanging out with my family. She's met them and they love her, but it still causes her too much anxiety.

Additionally, I have not met any of her friends or family. The only friend of hers I know is my former coworker, who introduced us. I don't even know for sure that any of her family or other friends know that I exist or know that she has a boyfriend. But because of her social anxiety and depression she doesn't hang out regularly with many other people besides me anyway.

She and my flatmate, (24/M) thankfully, get along with each other. I think it probably made it easier for her to be comfortable around him because it's almost unavoidable if she wants to come over to see me, so that adjustment was maybe easier because it was a ""necessary evil.""

Lately she's been more stressed out because of school, and current events, and personal trauma (which even though this is anonymous I would like to keep private), and she's ""not doing so well mentally,"" she told me. She hasn't wanted to come over to see me for months. She said recently she doesn't want to be around people. I feel like in this case my flatmate is somewhat of a deterrent, because it's an extra person to interact with. I feel like if I lived alone it would be less difficult for her to come over if it was only me she had to interact with.

What kills me about this is I can't just go over to her place to see her if she doesn't want to go anywhere, because she lives with her mother, whom I have not yet met. I've asked about meeting her family many times, but I've stopped mentioning it as often because I know how much anxiety it gives her just thinking about it. Whenever she's not doing well and she doesn't want to leave the house I wish I could just go to her, so I can eliminate the stress of her having to put on her armor against the world just to get to me. I just want to hold her.

We met each other almost 6 years ago, and were together sort of on and off (her anxiety playing a big role in that) and at one point tried to be just friends, until it became too painful for her to be around me and not be with me and she decided we shouldn't hang out anymore. For a few months I thought I'd never see her again. I always worried about her, because I knew I was the only one she really talked to when she was having hard times.

Almost 2 years ago she reach out and we met again to catch up, and it was impossible to resist the desire to be together. We realized there was no future that either of us could see without the other in it. We've talked about getting married, where we would get married, what time of year it would be, where to honeymoon, how many kids we want, possible names for the kids, etc. All these wonderful, beautiful things, but I can't imagine any of that happening if I don't at least meet one member of her family.

I understand that she isn't very close to them, and there's family drama (another source of anxiety) that she doesn't want to ""force upon"" me, but I am prepared for that. I've told her that I just want to be in her corner. I want to be with her during family gatherings as a buffer so that I can absorb some of the impact for her. I want to at least put faces to the names in the stories she tells me.

I just don't know what I can do without causing more stress for her. The more I try to convince her to do things I feel like I'm making her feel guilty for not wanting to do them. So whenever I do manage to get her to participate in something I fear that she's just doing it because she doesn't want to disappoint me and then she doesn't enjoy herself. But on the other hand if she does enjoy herself, and it's a positive experience, I'm afraid I'll try to get her to join in another group activity too soon after and it will be too overwhelming, and she won't want to because she feels like she already compromised recently enough, and then we'll wait too long again and it will be that much harder again to get her to hang out with friends.

I'm just worried for her. I don't know what to do. We're missing out on so much life together, and I feel so far from her. Please, if anyone has any suggestions, I'm desperate."
Anxiety,exercise triggers anxiety?,"Anyone have this happen? People talk about exercise like it will cure anxiety and depression, and I've no doubt it helps—would never stop completely—but in my experience it's very hit or miss. I have had panic attacks trigger seemingly for no reason other than the fact I am exercising. I get dizzy, feel weak, and have racing thoughts that won't stop until I am back home.

I've been checked out for circulatory issues too, so I know it's not that."

Anxiety,Post tooth extraction scared of sepsis,"Hi guys I hope you’re well ! I had my tooth taken out nearly three days ago first 1 and half days I had such a pounding head and felt tired, now I just feel nauseous dizzy and my head hurts. I’m so scared of sepsis and I saw symptoms of it and I’ve had them. The lady at the start said it was infected and at the end when I asked if it was infected she said no.

Anxiety,What are your favorite distress tolerance techniques?,"I just started therapy with a diagnosis of GAD, depression and OCD. I told my therapist that I like talking about things on reddit so she gave me the assignment of asking on reddit what y'all find helpful for distress tolerance.

Anxiety,first psychiatrist appointment,"soo my first appointment with my psychiatrist is on wednesday and i am super stressed out about it. 
i am going for my anxiety but i am scared i am secretly just being dramatic and my anxiety isnt even that bad. i am actually feeling bad about not having had a panic attack in a few weeks. 
also i have been feeling super detached from reality and i havent been feeling real for some time now (i have no idea how long. time doesnt feel real anymore) so i am scared that maybe its not just anxiety idk maybe i am really losing it.
i am just stressed and scares"
Anxiety,Need help with a best friend.,"My best friend has anxiety and social anxiety. I love her so so much  and I want to make her happy and at the same time, help her get rid of her anxiety. I’ve told her that I’m always here for her a million times and I’ve said quite a bit of stuff like “I would love to help”, and “let me know how I can help”. So she knows I’m here for her, I just don’t know what I can do that would make her day. Are there any words or things I can do for her that I might not be aware of? If there’s anyone who can tell me how you would like others to help you (if you have anxiety) I would love that so much! Thank you all, you are all beautiful people"
Anxiety,Anyone else wake up an hour before their alarm with stupid thoughts?,"I can't remember how long this has been going on for but for as long as I can remember, I've always woken up about an hour - 45 minutes before my alarm has gone off and it's normally my stupid bloody brain deciding to bring up memories from 20 years ago when I was in a bad place and fucked up alot of people's lives as well as my own, repeatedly! 

I hate myself for what I did and about 10 years after I did it all and pulled myself out of the gutter, I tried to correct some of my mistakes by reaching out to the people I fucked over. I didn't expect forgiveness but I wanted to apologise for who I was and how much of an absolute dick I was.

But I always wake up with these thoughts in my head, before my fucking alarm goes off and I don't know why... Fuck I hate this shit."
Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life,"TLDR: I’m really struggling and a bad session with my therapist today has left me feeling hopeless and defeated. I can’t keep living like this and I’m scrambling trying to help myself not completely drown in my problems. Being told I’m only in this situation because I’m not trying hard enough to get better is the biggest slap in the face. I just wish I had someone who understood that I’m doing all I can do right now. 

- 

Sorry for such a long post. I don’t know what else to do right now and am hoping someone who’s gone through something similar can offer support or advice on how to not give up. 

-

Last October I finally made the decision to seek professional help for my mental health struggles because I was in a pretty dark place and finally worked up the courage to see a therapist. I wanted so badly to just feel better. My grades were the worst they’d ever been (I’m a junior in college), and all the things that I’ve been ignoring and suppressing my whole life were finally catching up to me and I felt like I was drowning. 

In December, my therapist suggested I get screened for ADHD due to some symptoms he thought could be related. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and got officially diagnosed with ADHD - combined type, anxiety, and depression. I started stimulant medication for ADHD which my psychiatrist told me could make my anxiety worse at first. 

A month after starting my medication my psych prescribed me an antidepressant to help tackle to anxiety and depression as well. I was on Prozac for 3 weeks and felt like I was literally going insane. I have never experienced anxiety that bad in my entire life. I started having anxiety attacks multiple times a day, my intrusive thoughts became so overwhelming I could hardly hold a conversation, and I experienced physical symptoms that included headaches that never went away, jaw clenching and teeth grinding, sweating, and swallowing become really difficult because I had a constant lump in my throat.

My psychiatrist took me off Prozac a week ago and told me to start Zoloft today. I can barely function and feel worse than I ever have before and am terrified to start Zoloft because I don’t want it to effect me like Prozac did (and still is). 

Today I met with the same therapist I first started seeing for the first time in 3 weeks and was hoping I’d feel at least a little relief by talking through it to someone who could offer support and advice. I have developed a really good rapport with him and he’s been pretty helpful thus far, but today’s session was awful. 

The session started normally and was fine for the first 10-15 minutes, and then he said some things that really hurt me and made me lose hope that I’ll ever get better. He basically insinuated that the only reason I’m not making progress or feeling better is because I’m not trying to get better. That I can’t keep making myself the victim and doing nothing to help myself and expect to ever get better. 

The whole session made me feel so hurt, hopeless, and frustrated. I am trying to hard just to hold on and not let myself drown in the shit show that is my brain, as much as it may look to him like I’m not. I am constantly overwhelmed and doing my absolute best to not give up, but hearing someone I have confided in and felt comfortable with say these things to me has destroyed me. 

I feel like no one can see that I’m doing everything I can to hold on. I’m not making any obvious progress because all of my effort and energy is going towards simply surviving. If even my therapist thinks all my problems are my own doing, I can’t imagine what everyone else in my life thinks. I am so scared and running out of energy to keep myself afloat. 

I don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. If anyone is feeling the same way, you are not alone. If anyone’s gone through something similar, how were you able to save yourself? I will do just about anything to stop feeling like this."
Anxiety,How do you go to sleep?,"Recently I realized that I've been having a lot more trouble going to sleep, even when I'm exhausted. My head will hit the pillow, and even though I'm tired, my inner voice just sort of takes over and before I know it it's 3 am and I'm no closer to fall asleep. I've tried clearing my head by going for a walk before bed, meditating etc. I've been taking melatonin to help me go to sleep but I always wake up tired and I'm worried that's not a good habit to have for my sleep.

Any tips, tricks, or advice is awesome."
Anxiety,Opinions on people forcing help on you when you're having an attack?,"This person might be on reddit because they were advicing me to do something I read on reddit I think.


But basically I'd been anxious for days about travelling somewhere. It goes up and down and I was at a peak for a while and decided to let it out on Twitter a bit about how it sucks. I was asked to suck on an ice cube. I didn't want to do it. I usually just go through it and even if I did it it's just going to go down and come back later. I explained this and they asked me to just do it.

When I don't follow through the advice given I feel guilty like I'm choosing to suffer and I don't really want to heal or feel better. Accidentally telling people who don't understand It is also a pain. They just tell me ""see you're not going to do this. You're doing this, you're not going to be scared"" like it doesn't work like that. I also get sent random things they find online about anxiety, and I know it's done with good intentions but I'm not just anxiety? I appreciate it but like I don't know how to explain this. I will then have to accept it and do as told or I'm lying.

I was assigning myself a task to go to the store and buy something once for my social anxiety as someone had suggested. I told this to someone to make sure I follow through and don't back out. They told me ""go every day. Just do it. I know someone who was scared like this and he did this and it helped."" 

I wish I had people in real life who understood because I constantly have to deal with this everything is so hard and I want to tell someone it's hard for me, like please acknowledge this is a real something I'm not making excuses why would I want to not be able to do basic every day things.

I'm currently in the middle of explaining why I don't want to travel for 14+ hours in public transport to go attend classes because I'm scared of getting the virus and I can't mention anxiety because it's not a real thing but I've been stressing about it for weeks now."
Anxiety,GAD or Ptsd/c-ptsd? I’m such a mess :(,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was never able to pinpoint where it was stemming from. But, recently I found out that when I was 5 years old I was sexually assaulted by my brother who was 20 at the time. And looking at the medical files it seemed to be pretty bad. I have memories from my childhood. And since I’ve learned that this happened sex just makes me feel depressed...and since this came to light I’m just confused on if I have ptsd, GAD, or both. I relate a lot to what I’ve read about c-ptsd. But, I know I can’t self diagnose. I have no money for therapy and I’m honestly scared to go to therapy because I’m going to start remembering my repressed memories and I feel like I’m just going to get more fucked up rather than get better. What if what I remember is just too much for me to handle? What if I just break and I’m never the same? I was so close to my brother...and a lot of the things I like to do I used to do with him. He’s a big part of who I am...and now that I’ve learned this I feel like I’m stuck in a body/life I don’t want. Like I’ll never get rid of him...he will always be a part of me. I still can’t believe it...like I’m hanging on to this hope that somehow nothing happened. But that hope is stupid, because I saw what the doctors wrote and I know that it can’t be nothing. And he wasn’t charged with anything because it went through family court because I was in the middle of getting adopted by my grandmother (my “brothers” mom) and he was a minor. Also the doctor literally lied in court. Everyone in my life completely failed me."
Anxiety,Falling asleep with heart palpitations??,"I haven't had a hard time falling asleep due to me being focused on my heart beating, but ever since almost a week ago I choked on my gum and I was gasping for air for over a minute. After that my chest felt really tight, and now I'm even more scared that there's something wrong. Now I'm constantly putting my hand over my heart, seeing how my heart is beating cause my anxiety is so scared that I'm dying at 19. How do I convince myself that other people go through this and calm down? I've been awake for hours just scared my heart is going to ""skip a beat"" again. I had an ekg done today and it was normal. But I can't wipe it out of my head that I'm OKAY"
Anxiety,Shaking,"Hi, I'm going to seek help when I go back home to my country. But I just need to know how to deal with random shaking and feeling sick all the time. I cry a lot on my own for no reason and I feel like my ears sound weird when I feel intense. Sometimes I get tunnel vision, but only when it's really bad.

 I breathe heavily a lot, especially when I'm out - or at least it feels that way. I do feel like I'm overreacting but I don't know. I just need some advice. I've been trying calm myself down by putting my hand on my chest and breathing slowly but it doesn't help. I'm trembling too. I just feel so stupid. It's also hard for me to meet new people. I feel like I need to grow up, because I'm 20 and I still feel like this.  I've felt like this for as long as I can remember and I just want to be in control of myself. Please. Thank you"
Anxiety,DAE get about 10-15 minutes of sweet relief after a shower?,
Anxiety,Change in anxiety,"For the last year or so, I’ve been experiencing a fairly steady state of anxiety related to my international long distance relationship and the complications that COVID has added to that. For a long time, I didn’t have the words for what I was experiencing (I was mostly blaming my wife for how I was feeling, which was disastrous for us, but seems like we are pulling through now), but around two months ago, it finally hit me that the problem is at least in large part in my brain. Since then, I’ve started therapy for my anxiety and have done a lot of work on myself trying to get to the root of the problem. I’ve made some awesome progress; I have a lot of good days and have felt more often like myself in the last month than I have in the last year. With that said, I’ve had relatively frequent slips back into an anxious state (maybe half a day to a day a week). These episodes are far more intense than the long term stuff I’ve experienced, and I feel like I came close to having a panic attack today, which is new for me. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe this is a symptom of me finally rooting out and working on the underlying cause of my anxiety?"
Anxiety,Do you have intrusive worrying about bad things happening to your s/o?,"I often worry about things happening to my girlfriend. I am, however, not sure whether these are realistic or intrusive.

Some examples of my thoughts include her going out and getting kidnapped or attacked or something harmful.

The thing is, these seem to me to be valid concerns, but may be overboard for others. My girlfriend is on the smaller side physically and we live in an area with the occasional crime.

Do these thoughts happen to you? How do you manage between having a realistic concern and an intrusive worry"
Anxiety,My mind won't shut up,"Last few nights, I haven't been able to sleep because my head grows too hot with racing thoughts and headaches. It keeps whispering terrible things about my relationship, the one consistently good thing in my life, as being something to consider throwing away. All day, too, my brain feels warm from overworking; gives me headaches and lightheadedness. I'm scared I'm sick in the head, mentally and physically, but I'm scared to see a doctor in case it's true. I plan to see a therapist, as a start, but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to quiet it down in time. Hopefully I can sleep tonight."
Anxiety,Helplessly Backed into a Corner with Little Hope (Trigger Warning Possibly),"I just don't know what I am supposed to do. I feel trapped in my head and unable to escape the walls of my own prison. I deal with large amounts of anxiety now and depression to the point where I just want it all to stop. I don't want to kill myself nor hurt myself and I dont want to die. 

Basically I am suffering from thoughts of failing in college then being in a sea of debt. It has left me restless with imsomnia and made me worry or fail more. Im in a viscous cycle and I just want help. I also found myself in the wrong genre of music which also contributed to this. Slipknot, Korn, Five Finger Death Punch, Disturbed, etc. That was what I listened to until recently it was nothing but slipknot and korn. I also live in isolation in a apartment styled dorm and normally go outside 2 times a week. Im am introvert and shy around others. I also have bad social anxiety and I have hardly any trust in people I dont know. I feel as if someone is out there following me or stalking me. 

My friends have sent me to a hospital after my anxiety or panic attacks so I could seek help there. But hospitals have been known to put me under large amounts of stress or anxiety since I fear the worst. I didnt want to go but I thought I had no choice. When I was finally in they did the usual procedures up until they said they needed to do blood work on me. Now call me a wimp but I get weak and lots of more anxiety at the sight of any blood. (Hemophobia). I refused to let them do it to me and since I am old enough to make decisions. They couldnt do anything. But the thought of it as I type this out is making me squirmish. I have had it done before and I did get very close to passing out with my face flushed white as snow. I dont like the procedure nor the pain. 

Call me more of a wimp, I also cant swallow pills. I have taken pills before by either turning it into dust form and eating it in a sandwich (worst sandwich ever). Or by sucking on the gel pills and drinking the liquid with the help of water then spitting out the gel casing. I have tried to practice with ice or m&amp;ms but I just cant swallow it. I either gag or panic from the stress or anxiety it causes me. It also does not help that someone I knew passed away on accident not too long ago from taking anti-depressants and non-prescribed herbal medicine together. 

I want and need help, but because of the things mentioned above I feel as if I am barred or restricted from receiving professional help from a psychiatrist or whoever. I dont want anything medicinal, I just want a more natural cure. There has to be another way rather being prescribed happiness pills and relying on those. I just want someone to talk to that knows natural ways in which I can fix my mental health and not force me into a corner with no help unless I get blood drawn then get pills. 

Im hoping this post reaches someone who will understand my situation and suggest what I should do. I will not be getting my blood drawn, that is my stance, and I know it could help me, but I will never do that. Its just all too much for me to handle."
Anxiety,Trying to Cope,"I'm struggling really hard with anxiety related to my job, where every time I make a mistake I feel like everyone is going to finally reveal that they've secretly hated me all along and then I'll get fired from my only chance at balancing out my life. This happens with every level of mistake, from more common small ones to the (rare) larger mistakes. I do my job and I do it well, rain or shine, no matter how I'm feeling in a mental/physical health sense, but I'm still severely anxious every time something goes wrong and it was somehow related to me. I'm trying to tone it down and not be a burden to people, it's not my coworkers' fault that my brain is constantly on fire so they shouldn't have to deal with it or work around it. It's just hard to live in my own head so much and feel like everything I say is too much. 

I recently got a promotion that I worked extremely hard for, and now that I have it, my brain is in abuse survival mode where I'm on my best behavior going above and beyond to try and mitigate any removal of the ""privilege"" of being promoted via doing something to make the GM or owner angry, or making mistakes and such. It's utterly exhausting but I can't shake the feeling that the owner is gonna realize I'm not actually what he's looking for and then I'll lose this chance at finally getting to a secure place in life. 

I can't tell if I'm asking for advice or venting tbh, but thanks for reading."

Anxiety,I can’t “disconnect” from myself. I can’t shake this hyper self-aware feeling and it’s driving me literally crazy. Idk if it’s dp or what but it’s a horrible feeling.,"I’ve been stuck like this for years it feels. Maybe there’s been breaks here and there but for a while it’s like I’m just hyper self aware and self conscious of everything-my own thoughts, my body, sensations...I can’t lose myself in thought or daydream, can’t enjoy a movie or book...I thought depersonalization was like a dream like state where things don’t seem real but shit seems too real for me, too in my face...so I’m left not understanding this...I mean I know what’s caused it...being chronically stressed and anxiety ridden everyday for years, bad ocd that’s kept my focus inwards, drug abuse, benzo use, possibly some bad times with marijuana when it turned on me and started giving me horrid panic attacks in my late teens, severe bullying that went on for years that my shrink diagnosed me with cptsd for...whole bunch of shit I guess that got me like this and makes me realize there’s probably no getting out of this feeling...I feel numb and blank...I’m not overthinking as my dumb fuck worthless shrink says, I have no thoughts anymore basically, blank like I said...no emotions, just uncomfortable and squirming in my own skin. I don’t think I can take much more time feeling this way it’s Fkn disgusting and not worth living with. There doesn’t seem to be anything that makes it better...drugs relax me and ease it up a bit my awareness is still so extreme and focused on myself."
Anxiety,Please help I'm being gaslight by my mom,It's a very long story but my mom is not a good person she cheated on my dad with a guy I thought was my therapist who was actually and is very much a creep who would get half naked photos of me from my mom and photos of my face and claimed he can heal me if he has photos of me. He even told her to touch me down there and itl heal my anxiety which she did and ultimately molested me. She screams at me when I confront her about the molestation and deflects the situation. I keep going back to her every few months after not talking and thinking she's changed but she hasn't. She lives in another country with this man which I hate and have severe PTSD from and she had the audacity to video chat me 2 months ago with him in the camera and not understand the shock I felt when I saw him. I haven't talked to her since. Yesterday was my birthday I turned 24 she sent me balloons and cake and told myself I wouldn't talk to her and now we are having regular conversations because of the stupid cake and balloons made me want to text her thank you and it led to us catching up. I feel so fucking stupid im such an idiot I miss my old mom and that's what I want back but she's abused me on so many levels and even said I'm a waste of space and If she commits suicide I'm the reason for it and like I mentioned before she molested me. I just need to rant and I feel so stupid about talking to her like everything's normal when it's not ugh. Can someone help me and talk me out of this or explain why I'm such an idiot...thanks..

And this has given me the most intense anxiety for so many years seeing those people being successful on the internet through social medias or blogs.

I’m mad at myself for not creating like a youtube channel when I was younger and now when I see those teens or 20s (or even people in their 30s that started during their 20s) that live thanks to their online revenues I feel so anxious/jealous like I wasted my life and that I could have done something creative and earn money while doing it. But at the same time I don’t know what I want to do and as I said I’m so scared of « failing » that starting something scares the crap out of me. 

I wish I could put less pressure on myself and start a youtube channel just for fun and because I like doing this type of things but I always go back to comparing myself to those 17-18ish with millions of followers and millions on their bank account and I’m honestly mad at myself for feeling like this...

Last night I posted a video on tik tok to start somewhere and let me tell you I have had the most horrible night ever, I was feeling so anxious during my sleep, thinking that anyway it’ll lead nowhere and that I shouldn’t have even tried... I hate this self pressure and I hate thinking that if you are 25 and not doing what you like you failed your life :(

Do some of you feel the same ? Have you managed to control this anxiety/jealousy ?"
Anxiety,Eye twitch?,"I've recently developed a right eye twitch. It's kind of like a spasm. It's not super aggressive and I've not been sleeping well  or staying hydrated. I'm also overdue for an eye doctors appointment, nothing wrong with my eyes just a regular checkup for contacts. I'm just trying to let some of this covid stuff blow over before I go. I've done this in the past but my anxiety has gotten VERY bad this past year and I tend to blow things way out of proportion, and make them last much longer! Has anyone else ever done this?"
Anxiety,It just never ends and I don't feel like I can handle it anymore.,"I'm feel like I'm constantly running out of time. Everyday weekday is taken up by the stress of work. Every weekend is filled with things that have to be done and chores to get ready for the week. By the time everything is done, it's Sunday and the work week starts again.

It just never ends. I feel like I am constantly drowning in tiny tasks. I can't get them all done and so I always feel guilty when I'm trying to relax. I feel like I can't do this forever. What's the point of life if it's just constant work, stress and chores?"
Anxiety,Does socialising leave anyone else with a sense of loss?,"I socialized with some old friends yesterday (online) and even though I admit I had more fun than I expected and dare I say I even had a good time, I'm left with this feeling of loss. For what exactly, I'm unsure. Maybe it's a feeling of loss for the time I spent with them. That's time I spent being anxious with friends instead of laying in bed hibernating and recharging. Maybe it's a feeling of loss because now I'm alone again I miss the social closeness that I had for a moment. I know I won't have that again for a while because my anxiety will keep talking me out of it. Can anyone relate to this? I just want to spend time with people without feeling regret."
Anxiety,Research call: Has your diagnosis ever been changed or removed?,"Hi everyone! I am a researcher in the School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland, working in a team that are recruiting participants to hear their lived experiences of changes in their psychiatric diagnosis.

**Have you engaged with mental health services?**  
**Have you ever had a psychiatric diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis?**

**Consider participating in our research project!**

We are a team of researchers from University College Dublin conducting a project called Lived Experience of Diagnostic Shifts in Adult Mental Health. This study has received ethical approval from the UCD Research Ethics Committee.

For people experiencing mental health difficulties, it is fairly common that their diagnosis will change over the course of their engagement with mental health services. Diagnoses can be changed for many different reasons. Despite the frequency with which this happens, no research has explored how people experience these ‘diagnostic shifts’. Our study aims to identify how diagnostic shifts affect people’s lives and any challenges they may present. We want to use this information to improve support to mental health service-users during this time of transition.

For our study, we would like to interview people who have experienced a diagnostic shift. We would like people to tell us, in their own words, how they understood the reasons for the change in their diagnosis, and any positive or negative implications it had for their lives. Interviews will take place over videochat software (eg. Zoom) and all participation will be completely confidential.

By contributing to this study, you will help improve our understanding of people’s experience of diagnostic shifts and raise awareness of the challenges diagnostic changes can present. We hope to use the research to improve clinical communication of diagnostic changes and make it easier for people to adjust to these changes.

If you are aged over 18 and have previously experienced a change in their psychiatric diagnosis (i.e. had a diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis), we would like to invite you to take part in this study. To find out more about participating in the study, please email the researcher, Dr Cliodhna O’Connor at the details below. She will explain the study to you and answer any questions you might have.

Anxiety,I hate this shit I hate anxiety so much,"I stress and worry about everything, I always overthink things, my mind just doesn’t stop, when it gets bad I can’t think at all. But I keep passing it off as normal and I’m just overreacting. 
First thing in the morning I somehow find something to worry about. Then during the day I’ll have more racing thoughts. And these go on all day and all night if I can’t sleep. It’s like a cycle of non stop thoughts. My brain doesn’t turn off. It’s always thinking about something. I don’t know how anxiety does it. It somehow infects my mind all the time. 
Also the anxiety attacks, holy shit I hate them. The other day I was waiting for a teacher meeting and I started hyperventilating so bad I threw up in my mouth. 
And there are physical symptoms as well, but there’s honestly too many to list. Heart palpitations are the main one, so I worry if I’m gonna have a heart attack and die. 
Fuck this shit I hate it"
Anxiety,I can't fall asleep because I'm anxious about not getting enough sleep.,"Yes, I'm on reddit, because being alone with my thoughts is 10x worse.

Been having an attack for days because of school assignments. They aren't even difficult or long, but thinking about doing them makes me feel like I'm leaning over a cliff.

I'm just so tired of feeling like this, and feeling like there isn't anything I can do about it.

After writing this I realized it might come off as suicidal, don't worry, I'm not. I'm just exhausted."

Anxiety,Constantly nauseous.,I’m very unhappy at work and it’s triggering for a lot of reasons. It’s gotten worse and worse to the point where I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about work the next day. But even worse than waking up is my anxiety is now making me feel constantly nauseous. I could even throw up right now if I thought about it too much. I’ve applied to tons of jobs but rejected from every one so far :(
Anxiety,I'm just tired,I feel nobody will ever understand me. I'm always having anxiety and people around me doesn't even help. My parents would always say accept everything because that is life. But when I'm trying them to stop talking what they say doesn't even help and further makes me feel bad. They get angry at me. I'm just very tired.

Anxiety,How to calm down when feeling anxious,"This post might be a trigger. I'm not sure.

I got matched with a girl on Bumble and we've been chatting for a couple of days. It's been good and she mentioned that she's interested to know me better. I  feel the same about her as well. But the problem is that she usually takes her sweet time to respond to texts and I get too anxious about it if I don't get a response say within an hour or so. I did talk to her about it and I feel she is not being unreasonable. It's just I'm not able to manage my anxiety properly. I used to feel anxious before as well but recently it's become really hard.

How do you handle your anxiety in similar situations?"
Anxiety,I broke the loop for the first time!!!,"I can definitely tell I'm getting better! For the first time in months I DID NOT Google a strange bodily feeling this morning.

Had the strangest feeling flush over me and my first thing I'd normally do is start with Dr Google right away and then convince myself I've got a super rare cancer or something then start to panic which would put me in a low anxiety mood all day.

Not today anxiety NOT TODAY!

The war is not over but I won this battle!!!!!"
Anxiety,Fear of heart attack keeping me up again,"I developed this fear several years back and only just shook it recently with a trip to the ER. It only took the one for me, since I'm 21, don't smoke, no history, no problems exercising, everything came back great. I have also had very frequent checkups for other things lately and they've listened and everything still sounds OK. My blood pressure has never been bad, nothing. 

Recently, I started birth control, and I think the clotting risk (though it may only be for people with a history of clotting?) may have kicked it back up again. Also, I think reflux may have just caused a burn or something, because there's this pain at the center-left of my chest that gets worse when I breathe and just sits there. It's been there for a couple of days. 

Tonight was particularly bad because I woke up feeling weak and had waves of nausea. Cue mild shoulder, arm, and jaw pain (this has always happened; my body mimics symptoms of things when i know about them). Then, of course, I started feeling like I couldn't breathe. My panic attack calmed down pretty routinely, and I can breathe again, just not too deeply. Still, I can't shake the feeling that this chest pain/tightness that's still sitting there might be the one time I'm wrong. 

If anything, I'm just getting this out somewhere while I wait to feel OK enough to sleep. I want to put all this to rest, and maybe someone who has experienced this may have some tips for convincing themselves it's fine for long enough to avoid a trip to the ER. I keep googling, it keeps telling me to call 911, but I cannot afford that right now when this is 99.999% likely to be these other health conditions I know I have. Especially since I feel fine (for me anyway) now. 

I just hope I don't have another panic attack tonight. I was on a roll before this."

Anxiety,How to do acceptance of the anxiety ?," I have read a lot of posts here regarding acceptance that you have anxiety. I have anxiety disorder and it's getting better in my opinion day by day. 

But I have some days that something happens (e.g. had a job interview few days ago and I am waiting for an answer - and I kind of stressed out, more money, better conditions but a lot of work then my actual job) I am getting really nervous, impatient, or having different anxiety physical symptoms. 

In my mind is - yeah ok, I accept them, it's who I am now, It will pass someday. 
But the thing is that sometimes it works, and sometimes is not, and when not I suffer mentally and physically and it affects my life completely. Can't focus properly have no mood to go somewhere besides my home and so on.

My therapist says each meeting the same thing - accept that I have anxiety 🙃  and they will pass. 
But i do not seem to actually know how to do it...
Is there anything that I can do to learn how to do it ? 
Thanks !"
Anxiety,Anxious about going to appointments,"Whenever I have an appointment somewhere (for example a doctor's appointment) I always get extremely anxious. I think about all the stuff that could go wrong, I'm afraid that the receptionist will tell mell to fill out something and I won't be able to do it and make a fool out of myself, I'm afraid that the doctor will judge me, I'm basically afraid that somehow I will say something stupid or do something stupid and make a fool out of myself. Even when I'm on the phone talking to a stranger, I'm afraid that I'll say something stupid. Does/did anybody else have the same problem and knows something that could help with this?

Anxiety,"Coping with the past, trying to live in the present.","Since the pandemic, I’ve been having intense levels of anxiety and continuously hyper fixate on the past. Today I cannot stop thinking about high school (I graduated in 2016). I just keep thinking about how I was rude to classmates and teachers, and had very few good friends throughout the 4 years. I’ve definitely improved since then, but I can’t help but feel like I’m a lost cause because of how shitty I was back them. Then I spiral and convince myself I’m a total fuck up now. This cycle has been happening frequently for me and I’ve lost a lot of sleep over it.  I’ve tried reaching out to friends on the topic, but they don’t quite seem to understand.

Anxiety,A 'read' but not 'replied to' message gives me anxiety about every single person who left me without an answer,"Leaving people without answer is probably something everyone does once in a while. But do you ever feel so much anxiety in your body when someone does this to you and so you go down the past and think of every single person who didn't bother to reply to you and then you also never had a chat with them ever again? To me, it feels like the end of everything and since I've just one or two people I call friends, things become much worse if they also do it (although in their case I know they will get back to me at some point). Is it a normal thing to just go out of people's life that it shouldn't matter at all? Sorry but I had too much inside so I had to vent today."
Anxiety,Anyone with similar problem?,"Hi,

i will try to describe my situation with as little words as possible.

26 years old. It all started when i got a job in another country and had to move there. No friends there, everything is new and i lived alone in the apartment for about 10 months.

After i quit my job back then to move to the new one, i got a Atrial Fibrillation attack and that destroyed me mentally (i was a very active &amp; health person back then). Since my job in the new country asked to travel a lot with a car, that wasn't a problem until a Atrial Fibrillation attack happened again when i was stuck in a highway traffic jam. Seems like i developed a fear that when i am somewhere where i can't exit to safety or when i am far away from a ER (or any hospital), i get so much nervous because i think what if a AFIB attack happens again and i die? Luckily my cardiologist told me that there is a low risk for me to die since my heart is healthy and strong. I was given propafenone to use as ""pill in the pocket"" solution when the AFIB kicks in.

I went to almost every doctor to find out what was happening with me because that AFIB attack was new to me and some new disease came along (GERD, bowel inflammation...) that i haven't had before. They said i was almost perfect healthy and that i need to check with a psychiatrist. I was given alprazolam 0,25mg and that helps when the anxiety skyrockets because when i get in the situation that provokes my anxiety such as being in a place far away from safety or ER (highroad, plane or lets say woods), i could trigger a AFIB attack. 

I try to do the exposure therapy by facing my fears but it is not easy since the symptoms are so hard to manage (heart palpitations with potential AFIB depending how intense does the anxiety get, pins &amp; needles, chest and stomach tightness , feeling very lightheaded as i am gonna faint, face gets hot and feels like i am losing blood from my head, hands and legs).

What would you guys suggest? I hope i am not the only one. My thought is to continue with the exposure therapy and use the alprazolam if needed (i don't use it anymore as much as before ; 1 and half year free from that drug). Hope that meditation will help too."

Anxiety,Struggling with avoidance and recognizing it,"Hey everyone,

I am a 25 year old female with social anxiety. I tend to avoid a lot. I need a lot of time to get ready in the morning and I like to follow a certain order of things. I also struggle with leaving my house when it’s messy or if I haven’t vacuumed for instance. If I wake up in the morning slightly too late I cancel any plans I have because I won’t be able to stick to the things I normally do before I leave te house. I can’t pinpoint exactly where this behavior is coming from. Social situations I like to avoid altogether. I am in therapy and working on my social anxiety. If the routine/house cleaning thing is related to social anxiety I don’t know, it doesn’t feel as if it is. Does anybody recognize this? Or have any tips? Thanks in advance!"
Anxiety,"I'm not certain, but I think I just had an anxiety attack, have no prior symptoms afaik.","It's kind of just there in the title but for background, this is what happened. I'm writing this more for myself but any advice is great. Basically it went down like this. I was playing through some aim training, which is what I usually do right before I head off to sleep. I was adjusting my hand to do something and went from sort of a claw grip to fingertips only, and something just stopped me, right in that moment. The next thing I realize, I'm playing through a run and doing way better than my average. I realize at this point that due to my old mouse which I had switched off of just yesterday, I had changed my grip to accommodate the mouse, most likely.

That ""most likely"" triggered... something. It was like I was stuck in a loop of thinking. ""I changed my grip for this mouse. But when did I change my grip? Why dont I remember?"" That last part, it just kept repeating and repeating, like an echo chamber inside my skull. ""Don'trememberdontrememberdontrememberdontremember"". If you've ever seen one, it was like those ""madness"" scenes in anime where a single word is written on the background over and over. It scared me. I don't scare easy, but for some reason not remembering this one detail about how I hold the mouse triggered what I can only guess was an anxiety attack.

 I guess I'm looking for guidance? Advice on how to deal with this? This has never happened before and while i dealt with it this time, I'd like to know if there's a way to prevent it, for my own sake. Again, I was mostly just writing this to get it out of my head.

TL:DR I just had an anxiety attack for the first time and don't know the first thing about preventing future ones. Help."
Anxiety,Constant chest pain that last for days - what do I do?,"so, like it says in the title, i’ve been having this constant chest pain that’s lasted for a few days now. it feels tight and it’s um, painful to move or when taking bigger breaths. 

i’ve had these chest pains in the past (well, highly similar ones) and that really worried me. i had to go to the ER, i had to get multiple blood tests, i had to get an echocardiogram (and the outcome wasn’t bad, so that’s a good thing.) ...but that was about 2 or 3 years ago. since then, i’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, a mood disorder, and minor ocd. i’ve been taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication for just over a year now, and they’ve helped. like, i haven’t felt this kind of pain in years!

i’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, or something similar to this, where the chest pain lasts for a few days. i ask this because i can’t quite remember if in the past, my pain lasted for days or if it was just from time to time. 

any advice is appreciated. thanks very much :)"

My heart was racing and my hands were clammy, I couldn't think properly and my throat felt like it was closing up. You're already anxious about being judged and then when you have to give a speech right in the middle of having those symptoms, you then feel they can tell you're anxious because you are physically portraying it. Then you are worrying that you have exposed yourself and feel like they won't take you seriously and you feel embarrassed.

Anxiety,Tips to gain better control of your mind.,"
So, you want to.

Maybe you want to stop thinking about a recent breakup, or feel discouraged from a year of physical distancing and want to embrace a more hopeful perspective.

Unwanted thoughts can cause plenty of frustration and distress. You’re not alone in wanting to make them go away. It’s normal to have trouble convincing yourself to look up when feeling downcast in the face of stress and other challenges.

While actual mind control belongs in the realm of science fiction, you can work to change your mindset. It might take some effort to learn the trick of regaining control, but the 10 strategies below can help.

Identify the thoughts you want to change

It goes without saying that you have to figure out what’s on your mind before you can begin to control it.

Nearly everyone experiences discouraging thoughts or emotional setbacks from time to time. If you’re currently experiencing some life challenges, you might find it even harder to maintain control over spiraling thoughts or your overall mindset.

Occasional intrusive thoughts are pretty normal, too. They can be distressing, but they often pass as quickly as they intruded, especially when you don’t engage with them.

Other troubling thought patterns might include:

rumination, or looping thoughts

negative self-talk

cognitive biases, or errors in thinking that can affect your choices or interactions

a fixed pessimistic outlook

Identifying specific thoughts and patterns can help you make the most out of the other tips that follow.

Accept unwanted thoughts

It’s human nature to flinch away from pain, so of course you’d prefer to avoid thoughts that cause distress.

Yet pushing away unwanted thoughts isn’t the way to gain control. That usually just makes them more intense.

Instead, try the opposite: Accept those thoughts, and let them in.

Say you feel a little low because nothing in your life seems to be happening the way you planned despite all your hard work.

Acceptance might involve telling yourself, “Nothing seems to be going right, and that’s discouraging. There’s only so much you can do to create change yourself, but giving up entirely isn’t the answer either.”

Acceptance can even offer clues as to why specific thoughts keep coming up.

Maybe you keep thinking about a fling who ghosted you. Accepting those persistent thoughts leads you to recognize that you really wanted your connection to last.

Their disappearing act left you with unresolved questions and an overwhelming sense of unworthiness. You worry you’ve failed at dating and feel anxious about trying again.

Acknowledging these fears allows you to confront them and remind yourself that you’re not to blame for their bad manners.

Keeping the situation in perspective can help you manage your worries about it happening again instead of letting fear hold you back from finding someone new."

Anxiety,Anxiety and seeing distorted faces?,"I've always swept this stuff under the rug but maybe I shouldn't have. I've looked through the subreddit and saw a lot of posts about hallucinations before sleeping or right as you wake up and some about seeing stuff move out of the corner of your eye just to realize that it was a stationary object. 

Well I used to see distorted faces in my peripheral vision and I'm wondering if anyone can relate. For example, I would be sitting on the bus on my way to school and I thought some random person was staring at me with a scary expression on their face (sometimes almost monster-like) but when I turned to look at them straight on, they were always minding their own business and all I could see was the back of their heads. And this would happen multiple times in a single bus ride (not every day though). I always thought it was related to anxiety and stress so I wasn't too worried, does anyone have similar stories?"

Anxiety,Any experiences with Prozac?,"Good morning all. I have been on BuSpar for 1-2 months now and was having success, but it seems to be failing me now. My doctor just upped my dosage to 20mg daily (10mg 2x), but wants to possibly try Prozac. BuSpar I initially had few side effects other than emotional instability, headaches, dizziness, and light sensitivity the first 2 weeks. My doctor wants to try Prozac because I am having panic attacks immediately as I wake up, and she thinks having something in my system long-term would help. Now to note, I have emetophobia and I am absolutely terrified of the idea of possible nausea or vomiting side effects of medication. It took me forever just to try the BuSpar. Prozac seems to have nausea as one of the side effects. Anyone have any experiences with Prozac overall?"

Is there any risk of long term damage from taking them inconsistently in the past? Nausea is generally the only side effect, as well as brain zaps in the times that I've gone off it.

edit: I know it was a mistake to be inconsistent and that you need to take SSRIs regularly for them to work. I am working to get better at it. I have fairly severe OCD, and it just makes general functioning very hard sometimes. But I am working to get my life in order and just wanted to know if there were long-term effects from my past mistakes."
Anxiety,"A new way of understanding Anxiety, that really helps.","My whole life I really didn't understand anxiety.

I knew I often felt an overwhelming response to things that didn't match my situation, but I wouldn't have called it anxiety.

It wasn't until I started to learn about anxiety that I realised, in fact I had been suffering from it my whole life.

But what is it?

Well, what do we know?  We know it doesn't feel good.

It's an uncomfortable, sometimes consuming feeling that can be activated in response to something, but our reaction is way out of proportion.  Or it can just be there seemingly without reason, triggered by a thought or with no obvious cause.

Here's what I've learned studying with my teacher Daniel Packard.

This horrible feeling that is out of proportion to the situation around us is because of a build up of neglect.

A build up over your whole life of situations where you or other people didn't treat you well.  And, often the mistreatment wasn't just once.  You may have been in situations where you knew you weren't feeling good and you stayed in them because you were afraid to get out.

**Here are some major areas of neglect to your emotional system:**

* Not setting boundaries
* Saying yes when you mean no
* Not telling people how you really feel
* Not sticking up for yourself/avoiding conflict
* Not going for something you really want
* Setting goals and beating yourself up for not achieving them
* Beating yourself up for anything
* Needing to be liked
* Caring what people think
* People pleasing

Doing some or many of these?  Then it's natural that you would feel a build up of neglect, i.e anxiety.

The anxiety is a warning system that is saying ""I've had enough!"" I can't take this any more.

It's not the cause of your problem but the warning bells going off to let you know that there is a problem.

Then when something seemingly small happens on the outside you can have an out of proportion reaction because your system is overloaded.

Of course, you probably already know you need to take better care of yourself right?  We know we need to but we don't always do it.  Why is that?

It's because these things are scary to do.  It's scary to speak up, set boundaries, say no.  It's scary that people might not like us so we need to make sure they do.  Beating yourself up also comes from the fear of what might happen if you don't whip yourself to do something.

So, one of the main factors under why you've not being taking care of yourself for so long, and why you have a build up of neglect you call anxiety, is because there is a fear underneath preventing you from taking better care.

I won't go into full detail here but this fear and inaction are also connected to two deeper elements which are the real root cause of anxiety and much of human suffering in general.

These are two false but strongly ingrained beliefs;  ""I'm not worthy"" and ""I'm not good enough""

With this post we can at least understand a bit better what anxiety is, we are more ""problem aware"".  If you'd like to know more and hear about the solution feel free to get in touch.

I hope this post was helpful!

Anxiety,i’m up at 1 am making lists when i should be sleeping.,"i woke up at 11 to my mom puking in the bathroom. she’s sick right now and it’s worrying me. 

i couldn’t fall back asleep until 2 am. i smoked a little bit to maybe help me fall back asleep but i only took a few hits, i didn’t want to take too many and risk still being high a couple hours later.

i had so much on my mind last night. my mom’s health, her finances, best friend not texting back, my workload. so i made a list at 1 am on what i need to do at work and finally an hour later i was able to fall asleep. 

lately i’ve been feeling very disconnected from people. i’ve went completely MIA on social media (not that anyone really cares), i’ve ghosted my friends (which i guess i can’t be too upset when my best friend doesn’t text me back), and i’ve just been very stressed i guess i don’t know. 

i used to have horrible insomnia and i’m hoping it’s not coming back."
Anxiety,Please PLEASE PLEASE school interview,"I feel so nervous. Just came off a school interview and the service kept shaking and I was so nervous  it was my first more official interview. they asked about leadership skills as I just went blank. They asked if I've seen their clubs and I have but I couldn't remember I just- I would just sometimes jumble words and even though I had an idea of what I wanted to say, i just end up- 😭😭😭😭😭 wish I could rewind time I wonder what they thought of me after I left and they were so nice. No reason for me to be worried but I was.😭😭😭😭. I could just faint. 😭😭😭😭 I need to take some serious online classes on public speaking. If anyone knows where I can find such a class I would really appreciate it."
Anxiety,Anyone else get horrible gastric problems from their anxiety?,"I already have IBS in my family (yay, me), but I’ve found that my anxiety makes my stomach problems so much worse. It’s constant off-and-on problems with cramping, gas, bloating, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes outright pain. Sometimes I’ll get a jolt of nerves and the suddenly I have horrible stomach pain. Other times I just feel mildly sick. It doesn’t even matter what I eat, nothing seems to help. It can be really discouraging and debilitating. When my anxiety is higher, it always makes these problems WAY worse. Then the vicious cycle begins and it gives me MORE anxiety. 

Am I alone in this? I hate anxiety!"
Anxiety,Took one pill of Paxil for recent surge of panic attacks but decided I don’t want to take anymore the next day. Is there any thing bad about taking an SSRI for only one day?,
Anxiety,I bought some clothes today,"Heart was racing in the store and it was pretty busy, I waited for the changing room area to clear up before going to try clothes on. I bought a shorts and a hoodie and that was enough for me and needed to go home but I did it :)"
Anxiety,Anyone else ever had lymph nodes pop up after an infection or cold and never go away and stay palpable?,"
I’ve had all the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck going to the jaw enlarged for 2 years. Can they stay enlarged sometimes normally?



25 male. Two years ago I had a very bad upper respiratory infection that took nearly 2 weeks of antibiotics to kick. I coughed up blood it was so bad. Anyway two weeks AFTER the antibiotics all these nodes flared up. Never once been tender. I can feel 4 roughly baked bean shaped in the posterior cervical left side, one a little further back along the change behind the head, as well as 3 along the anterior cervical left side a bit bigger more like kidney bean size, and 2 under the jaw and chin both peanut MM size. All mobile all non tender etc. docs felt them and ran bloods; they ruled out EB viruses including mono, they ruled out HIV, thyroid normal along with other basic stuff. The only oddities were mildly low WBC which I continue to have to this day (like just under normal) mildly low MPV and very weak positive ANA (such a low titer they didn’t even read it according to the report) The did an ultrasound of the neck which said ‘lymph nodes on the L side of neck are noticeably more prominent than the right however not large enough to qualify for biopsy’ so basically saying they agree they are enlarged but not quite enough to investigate further. 

Largest node was 2.4 cm X 0.8 cm I have over 7 that are longer than 1cm. I though anything longer than 1cm was abnormal??

Anyway I’m just confused, why would nodes get stuck? Doc said sometimes they just don’t go down, I’ve heard a couple people mention they have one or two that they can still feel but to have 14 all on one side of my neck?? Isn’t this concerning?

Obviously I’m not asking for diagnosis but since the docs say it’s supposedly common I want to know if any of my worrisome brethren have experienced this too"
Anxiety,Losing my confidence,"first of all this may sound dumb for some people. But this is a real problem of mine and i am struggling like never before. 

Im in my second semester of college. I went to one of the best high schools in my country and i was successful even without studying much. I was always like this, i was at the top of my class even without studying throughout my life. I was always believing myself and i was confident. 

I got accepted to one of the best universities in my country. first semester of the college started out the same way. I was again confident and wasnt studying much.  understandably my grades suffered very much. I understood that i have to work hard. and honestly i was already doing some work because we have so many assignments throughout the year but i realized i had to put some work.

I am studying more this semester but i dont feel confident in myself at all. Both because i am not used to working, and also because i lost my confidence i feel extremely anxious. I am overthinking future constantly. Remaining three years of the college is extremely scary to me and after that there is work life also. This unreasonable amounts of stress is killing me. please help"
Anxiety,How do you tell the difference between anxiety and disassociation/derealization?,"To start off, I likely have OCD and am being treated w 5mg Lexapro. I used to have religious OCD when younger but I became non religious and no longer felt that way. I now go to a catholic school because my parents wanted me to and it’s a good school.

Fast forward to this morning 

We have something called 7:17 liturgy on thursdays which is optional, but if your club is hosting you have to attend. I’m in NHS and we were hosting this time 

I’ve been in church thousands of times even while being non-binary, gay, autistic, so many alienating things but I’m usually able to stomach it and get through it with mild annoyance that I have to take time out of my day for this. But today was different 

I haven’t been relatively anxious since starting my medication, and religious stuff usually doesn’t make me feel like... this.

When I was there, it started as mild annoyance at some bible contradictions, nothing I couldn’t handle but.. as time went on, as I noticed everyone singing in sync, everyone so happy and comfortable, everyone else was right where they were supposed to be it seemed. Everyone knew I wasn’t religious but I couldn’t ignore the subtle side-stares of my teachers and classmates as they realized I wasn’t singing/praying. One of the youth ministers gave me a hymn book halfway through because I didn’t grab one because I’m not religious, even though I refused it and,... I’ve just never been so aware that something about me is wrong.

It felt... unnatural, how in sync everyone else was, how normal this was to them and wrong how scared I was, how choked I felt, how I felt like I was harboring some dark, slimy, inky black evil mass inside of me working it’s way through my veins. Five minutes before the bell rung I couldn’t take it anymore and I ran out, and once I got out of the room I could breathe again, even though there should have been no issue breathing before 

In my first class everything still felt wrong. Not just me but.. everything. Touching my head long enough to fix my hair felt sinful. Everything I looked around at felt wrong somehow even though I knew these rooms. The items inside and the people inside felt fake. 

I know the objects around me in this room are what they are, and if I touch them I will feel them and they will behave according to their properties. I know that. But I can’t help but feel like it’s a cover for something. That hell is lying underneath. The room I’m really in must be different. I don’t know how much it differs from the one I’m in, maybe it’s barely a noticeable difference. But it can’t be this one. I feel like it can’t be.

What am I experiencing??? Is this just super charged catholic guilt or more?"
Anxiety,I think I just had and still have a derealization episode and I’m really scared. Been dealing with multiple panic attacks the past few days and started to feel better yesterday until this episode happen. Is this going to get better?,Just been in a bad mindset recently this past week and I know that doesn’t help. I felt like I wasn’t in my body and I’m just watching my body do things. I’m worried about my mental health developing new things and it never going back to normal and the thought is freaking me out right now. My fear is developing some sort of schizophrenia.
Anxiety,Stress,"So I thought sense I’m new here guess I should get to know some people. So I’ve decided that just whenever I have a very anxious moment or feel like I need to talk about something I can say it here where I don’t feel the scary feeling of people judging you case, YALL DONT KNOW ME :)))! 

Today I woke up with some bad shoulder problems and pain in my lower back. Morning wasn’t starting off nice anyways considering that night I woke up sweating with the ceiling fan on high no clothes on and no blanket multiple times. 

I am sorry for being selfish typing shit about myself on here. If anyone would like to vent fee free to add"

Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety about eating? Possible TW?,"I’ve slightly struggled with an ED on and off for a few years. However, the anxiety I get about eating doesn’t stem from the ED. At least I don’t think so? It’s not that I necessarily get anxious about my weight but I absolutely HATE putting anything into my body. I know it seems extremely weird because of course you need to eat to survive but my brain has somehow started associating eating with something scary and I get insane anxiety about eating or drinking anything. The only “safe” drink for me is water. I’m not sure what exactly it is but I just get really worried that the food will make me feel sick or weird. I’ve never had food poisoning or anything so I have no reason to already be wary about this. I’m not sure if I make any sense at all but the idea of food making me sick or somehow containing drugs is too much for me to handle and I can’t even thing reasonably when it comes to food. I feel like I know that my food isn’t going to contain some sort of drug and it’s unlikely that it will give me food poisoning. But once I get that anxious feeling in me, it’s game over. Does anyone else feel this way about eating? Even if it’s not for the same reason I get anxious, I just need to know if anyone experiences this as well."
Anxiety,I hate this..,"There are times, like today, where I would wake up feeling severe to mild anxiety. I'm feeling super anxious and I don't know why. Does anyone have advice on how to control it?"
Anxiety,Feeling like you can’t escape your own head?,I’m super anxious rn waiting on a text back from someone and my brain will not SHUT UP. It’s like this pretty frequently but more when I’m anxious. It’s constantly thinking of the worse case scenarios and I just cannot. Stop. Thinking. It also might be a coping mechanism but I also cannot get songs stuck out of my head. I’ll think of a new song to think of and that one gets stuck! I’ll literally have the chorus of 2 songs stuck in my head for 12 hours and this whole cycle makes me want to smash my head in. I’m not on anxiety meds bc my thyroid medication is supposed to help but it’s not. Should I look into it?
Anxiety,I hate anxiety because it makes me more conscious that I’m living on this planet.,[deleted]
Anxiety,Im terrified of climate change,The storms are going to come and shut down the power grid and chaos will erupt and I will be cold and without food or water and I’ll die because I’m too weak.

Anxiety,Triggered by Jealousy,Does anyone else get upset with their boyfriend or GF are looking at others on social media? I notice my boyfriends feed has pretty much naked girls on there and I guess it’s “normal” for guys to look at that stuff.

Anxiety,I honestly have no clue what I'm doing and I'm worrying about it.,"I cancelled my place at university because of how much I enjoy sports and the possibility I could be good at it. 

The issue is though I also want to go to university and study physics as I do enjoy it.  

I'm worried now because I don't feel I'll get the the chance to go to university in the future and also if I end up regretting becoming a pro boxer because of the fear of not making a good career out of it. 

I just sent another email asking to remain on the course. 

I genuinely don't know what to do because either way I feel I'll be anxious about it."
Anxiety,I think my anxiety kept me thin before.,"Had bad anxiety most of my life.  It got really bad, so I started taking medication for it at my doctor’s recommendation.  The medication worked, but I gained just over 70 lbs in 3-4 years and could not seem to lose any.  I avoided seeing people and dodged photos out of shame.    Any picture of myself resulted in depression.  Was doing well anxiety-wise so I was weaned off of the medication.  Stopped seeing my doctor because he was not on my insurance and we were not in a place where we could afford that expense anymore (he didn’t accept any insurance at all.  He was good, way better than my previously insurance-covered doctor).   Weight started coming down finally.  

Yesterday I made a mistake at work.  Overstepped and was disrespectful.  I didn’t mean to be, my intentions were in the right place but I practiced poor communication and it resulted in someone I respect a lot being insulted and feeling unconsidered.  We are talking today and I know it will be fine after we do but I have been in a panic for 24 hours and I have not been able to eat.  I’m realizing now how often this occurred before.  I regularly would go one or more days without eating.  I think I need to start seeing someone again. But I’m also scared to get back on medication. It feels hopeless.  Fat and depressed or thin and anxious."
Anxiety,I haven't had panic attacks for months but I still think what if my anxiety comes roaring back and I will be disabled and unable to work. Is it common?,"Hey

So I had severe anxiety around October and it involved daily constant anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. I started practicing some lifestyle changes and reading some therapy books so I got really better. I haven't had panic attacks for months and Although I still sometimes feel mildly anxious, it's not overwhelming and I can pretty much deal with it.

But I have this fear that my anxiety will come back in a very severe form and I can't do nothing about it , it'll make me disabled and unable to work and nothing (even medication) can't make it better (I've never taken anti-anxiety or depression medication, I've rarely taken beta-blockers, last one months ago).

So I know that usually major depressive disorder may lead to disability and I haven't heard about disability due to anxiety much (and I've even read that anxiety responds well to medication) but still I perhaps irrationally fear that I'll be disabled for long term due to anxiety and all my skills and things I learnt in college will be of no use.  

Have you experienced something like this? And in case you're a therapist/psychiatrist or you've discussed this problem with one, are there facts and tips to calm my mind?"
Anxiety,Anyone else had weight gain from stress?,"I've honestly put on so much weight probably due to lockdowns (UK) and not being as active. I'm trying to shift by eating healthy and working out but it doesn't seem to be working. I honestly never used to put on weight so wondering if stress could be a trigger and if anyone else has had this problem?

Any weight loss tips would be really welcome."
Anxiety,Travel question,Hi my fellow anxiety sufferers.. I suffer from anxiety but mostly in work setting and sometimes social but for the most part I can live a normal life.  I have been with my boyfriend for six years and he still hasn’t visited my family in Colorado. My family is very important to me and he has a lot of issues with family and gets anxiety aroijd families and says they are all “ fake happy “ I know it’s because he grew up around his family arguing the time and instability as a child etc so that is how he views all families. I grew up with a loving and supportive and non judgemental amazing mom and dad and my boyfriend had met them numerous times but doesn’t like hanging out with them. He even says they are so nice and loving but just can’t make the trip to see where I grew up. I have told him it does mean a lot to me but in a gentle way a few times and o just got back from visiting them and once again I went solo.. my parents understand anxiety and love him no matter what but it’s starting to get to me .. I want to know everything about my partner and seeing where they grew up and having a decent relationship with family is important to me..does anyone else struggle with this ?? Also weddings .. I go solo because again he hates family and traditional things so anytime I try an invitation for a wedding my heart drops knowing he won’t go. It’s making me sad but I don’t want to deny the anxiety. He won’t see a therapist either and says they can’t help him. I feel like I am living my life and going on trips by myself and not on a true partnership after almost 6 years now. Ideas / thoughts ?? He IS a loving and kind person and we have lots of fun together so it’s not all bad but these issues are becoming bigger to me as life goes on. In the beginning I let it slide and now getting annoyed. Any thoughts appreciated !
Anxiety,My school want me to call them for something and I have no idea why.,[deleted]
Anxiety,How do you move on after being rejected?,
Anxiety,I recently did a post on anxiety and got quite a few people who found it relatable...,
Anxiety,"If I die, I did","Anyone else at the point of their anxiety where the thoughts are - Well, IF I DIE,  I DIE! 

Shortness of breath,  tight muscles in chest,  back pain - ""oh well,  if I die,  I die"". 

Frustrated with not living my life, that I want to burst out  of this fear and just face death at this point.  I'm so sick of not living! Fuck you death,  come get me then,  Mr. Boogeyman. I'm done with your shit"
Anxiety,Does anyone else have weird anxiety habits,"Does anyone else pull out their hair or scratch themselves when they're anxious about something and do it without thinking? Or is this not an anxiety thing. No idea what causes this tbh. I do it all the time.

Sometimes I scratch myself so hard I end up slicing through my skin with my nails lmao"
Anxiety,Intrusive/negative thoughts,"What are ways that help to stop thinking stupid shit? Shit, that I am making up but get so convinced it's true.. for example, I constantly think people don't like me and are against me..I am going insane 😳"
Anxiety,Spotify Playlist - Zen Music,
Anxiety,Anxiety or paranoia??,"So since we had our baby (she's one year now) my mind has always been scanning and coming up with the most horrific scenerios. Walking through Walmart toy section, ""oh my god marbles, she would choke and die on those"". It's never just normal thoughts about things babies can't have, it's always the most extreme, terrible scenerios. At night I lay in bed and think ""oh my god what if someone snuck in her window and took her and I wouldn't have enough time to get out of bed, find some sort of weapon, chase them down, then what if I was going to catch him and he decided to throw the baby on the pavement just because he's evil"" and I get so worked up. Then I lay in bed feeling worried that someone might actually break in and I have to spend time calming myself down. These kinds of thoughts happen daily. Is this anxiety mixed with being a new parent or am I truly paranoid? I have a very bad phobia of schizophrenia so whenever I realize that I might be paranoid I freak out and start asking myself if I'm crazy and it's just a never ending cycle."
Anxiety,Anyone constantly make excuses to get out of plans way too often bc you’re too anxious to follow through?,"a made up excuse always works better than me admitting to having anxiety bc people don’t seem to understand anxiety. they think it’s a nervousness. they’re like ?????? looking at me like i’m stupid. they don’t get that i’m shaking, short of breath, throwing up, dissociating, crying, etc. it’s honestly crippling and over the years i’ve lost a lot of friends bc i can’t follow through on plans that we make. 
then i’m anxious as hell when i cancel bc i feel like they hate me but i just can’t help it. aside from having severe anxiety, i’m a loner. a homebody, an introvert. 
i do fine with the texting thing but people don’t really do that. 

i’m on meds again, so i’m hoping one day it’ll get better. also w therapy."
Anxiety,Anxiety Hangover,"Does anyone reading this experience an anxiety hangover? After 5 days of constant panic attacks and obsessive thoughts, I finally feel like myself again, however I'm so tired and achy and super tired. Feels like I have a flu, minus the head cold. Anyone else experience this? How long does it last for you?"
Anxiety,I am at a devastating loss for solutions with my anxiety; Any insight helps.,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, add and ocd for some time now. Each condition has its own place and issues in my life, but my anxiety has always been the most painful. I am on a mixture of anxiety/mood depression and adhd medication and also have frequent therapy sessions in addition to the medication management.

Example  —   
Psychiatrist - “go outside, don’t think about what or why you’re walking outside. Just do it, look at the architecture, smell the air” (as a Manhattan resident I chuckled out loud at the part lol). 
Me - “well that sounds nice, but I have stuff to do like make a living and pay rent and think about. Real stuff, not superficial things made up by me, so I can’t really put those things off because they are essential.  

Recently, I’ve discovered my anxiety is my personality; I realize that nearly every interaction I have is not genuine. I try so hard to make it genuine; when a cashier says have a nice day, I yearn so strongly for me to be able to take that interaction and believe that I can have a nice day but I know I won’t. I still say thank you, you as well, hoping maybe that will spark something. It never does. I sit with friends and we conversation, shoot the shit, you know whatever; sure maybe I laughed at that joke that wasn’t funny or maybe added something to the convo, but it wasn’t real or genuine. And then when I’m done talking my mind starts it’s engine back up and proceeds to overheat, which is how my mind always is. Always racing, going around in a big circle like a tumble dryer except it never dries anything. It’s a massive jar of every situation snd scenario of everything that ever existed, frantically buzzing around and there’s a tiny tiny opening where these thoughts can be expelled into words, but the organizer doesn’t work so that shit just either comes spilling out, or the more common thing that happens; I hold it all in because I know it won’t make sense to anyone else. 

What bothers me the most out of everything is how the heck do I deal with anxiety about things that have actual consequences. Like things that I actually cannot afford to fuck up. I have anxiety shout everything, however after a panic or anxiety episode attack, I am at some point able to pick apart which triggers were due to a nonexistent fear, and which things were actually something that is a real concern. 

Like, in therapy we’ll think, ok well you love the city, you love being outside in the sir and light; how about take a walk to clear my head and reduce the anxiety. Ok. Well. Um that is not a possibility. I have rent to pay, I need to get that money by working on my computer. This can’t be put off. Oh, my computer had water damage so that can’t work either, get a new one? Nah no money for that right now. These are things that have actual consequences and can’t be solved by therapy. I am the kind of person who will get what I want. Meaning if I want to live in this apartment — the view eases my anxiety, it is exactly where I WANT to live, etc, despite the higher rent price — I will live there. Because I am living my life and trying to not let my anxiety or depression control me. If I tell s psychiatrist therapist about this, I can’t accept their all too familiar answer of “just take a break from things right now, slow down”. ??? Why would I deliberately stop doing something that is tailored to my conditions, to try and subdue those same conditions? I understand this can work for patients and is legitimate good medical advice for some, really! however not me. Many times mental health treatment comes in the form of slowing your life down to focus on your mental, but like I don’t slow down. I don’t want to. I never will because I fucking love doing things that I love and loving myself. 

Sorry that was long as fuck lol.

TL;DR what to do when many forms of treatment to “ease anxiety” are not an option when slowing down and trying to control my mind will prevent me from literally working and earning a living with the woman I love."
Anxiety,How I deal with anxiety,"So I've been struggling with anxiety for quite a while now and I just want to share this, so everybody struggling with this can try this and see if it helps. So here are the things that help me with anxiety

If I'm going somewhere outside of my safe zone or home I always bring some kind of self-defense tool (most of the time it is little pepper spray on my keys) This way I feel safer and prepared if something bad happens.

Other things I usually do is when I'm somewhere outside and start feeling very bad I guess ( I don't know how to describe it I just feel like everybody is watching me and making fun of me) I start singing in my head something I call ''bad bitch songs''. It sounds hilarious, but songs like WAP or Boss Bitch really help me distract from my surroundings and give me confidence.

Usually, when I go out I always bring someone with me just to don't be alone, because going alone in stores is terrifying for me and this way I have someone who can help me and even have fun shopping

I have started playing the guitar again and finding new hobbies this has really helped me a lot with anxiety and in my free time, I try to help people who are going thru the same things I've been thru. I really hope this helps you and have a good day❤"

My therapist has suggested I sit into my anxiety and just let it be, acknowledge and take a moment to say ‘I’m not going to die or nothing bad is going to happen.’ 
Let yourself get sweaty, feel the stomach cramps. I asked ‘how do I do this’ her: ‘with a lot of practice!’ She knows this from personal experience.

She suggests this because if you feel the onset of anxiety and you jump to your strategy, then you are putting it off/fighting against. Your body thinks it can’t handle it. However if you sit into it then you’ll body will begin to see no threat. 

It’s going to be hard. Trying work tomorrow for the first time in 8 weeks! Hoping for the best.

Anxiety,Acceptance,"19M.I’m sorry if this triggers anyone, but I want to get this out of the way already. I want to know how to accept my own mortality. Just to clarify I’m NOT dying, at least I hope not but thats just me being a hypochondriac. I’ve been having health related issues for months. For a month, I tried to ignore it  so I wouldn’t have to think about it. Also, I thought ignoring it was better within my family due to the constant dead ends in finding what’s wrong with me. I keep having these growing thoughts of impending doom. With the pandemic and the fear of terminal illnesses, I’ve been having a hard time accepting my own mortality. I keep thinking about how I’m not ready. Cursing myself for wasting the time I had alive. Time I could’ve spent living with purpose instead of by habit. Time I could’ve spent finding out my strengths and weaknesses. More time laughing instead of suffering in silence. The fact that my life amounts to shit. The uncertainty of what comes after death. I can’t run from it. I feel it would be better if I learned how to accept it, so I can transition into it without kicking and screaming."
Anxiety,Just need someone to talk to,"My anxiety took a nice long hibernation. It was amazing. I felt normal for about half a year, with a few anxiety hiccups along the way. It wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t as bad as this. I feel it coming back again and this past week has felt like I’m holding my breath. I can’t let it go. My chest feels so restricted and I feel like I’m holding in tears constantly. I could have a panic attack any moment that I want. It’s right there, perching. Sometimes I don’t feel like I have a spine or skeletal support. I feel like water in a thin membrane and any moment, I’m going to collapse. I don’t have anyone to talk to rn who understand this, but my friends mean well."
Anxiety,I have to wake up in four hours and see no chance of me falling asleep,"I love music. One of the few things keeping me going anymore is music. During quarantine I decided that actually wanted to learn how to make it myself. I can’t sing or play any instruments other than piano, so I took the time to learn to sample music and I think I’m okay at it. I want to release my first project soon, and I have all of my beats finished. However, since picking up music, I keep lying awake at night, obsessing over fixing, tweaking, and even scrapping beats. How can I take my mind off things and stop obsessing over fixing something I can fix tomorrow.

Edit: the idea of what I make not being good enough is driving me insane. I don’t know if this is considered anxiety but it’s driving me nuts."
Anxiety,Anxious thoughts are affecting my sleep,"How do I control my anxious thoughts at night time?

I (29 m) have had problems with my anxiety for a couple of years. I’m in a professional career and have moved jobs a couple of times as I wasn’t happy in the companies I worked in. I most recently moved jobs two years ago and was told that the small company was fantastic to work for, but once I joined things started to go really badly and much worse than my previous jobs. The person who worked below me took an extended period of time off for mental health issues which left me to do the two jobs. When this happened I found out that the person I had replaced had taken a few months off for mental health reasons before they were made redundant. 

I am constantly thinking about work but it doesn’t physically affect me during the day as I can find lots of distractions. But once I get into bed my thoughts about work go into overdrive, meaning I struggle to breathe properly and get so hot that I’ll have beads of sweat on me, even though I sleep with a window open and the temperature outside is below freezing. I’ve been trying Meditation through the Headspace app which works sometimes, but other times my thoughts are going so fast that I can’t even hear the app speaking to me. I get about 4 hours of sleep a night, meaning I’m exhausted the next day. This results in me not performing as well as I should in work the next day which then drives anxious thoughts at night time again. I’ve even slowly cut my caffeine intake to zero and it hasn’t helped so far.

Has anyone got any tips on how to increase my hours of sleep or how to get through a tough job with very little sleep?"
Anxiety,I actually feel like I have no solutions,"So back when it was my bday i got drunk, I started asking her a buncha times if we could kiss and stuff and she was saying no and i kept asking. Too be fair i was asking if it was sexual harrassment and she was like no but the thing that bothers me is I think I knew it was bad but the drunkness made me not feel guilty. And when i did feel slightly guilty I asked if sexual harrasment. And with the kiss questions I wasnt aggresive i was just asking a lot. The reason she was saying no is because my siblings were there and it would be like PDA. She says it really isnt that bad and that there were no victims. But end of the day theres no excuse for sexual harrassment even if it is my gf or even if i was drunk. There was no excuse for the sexual harrassment and I cant deal with it. Ive never had this cause this is a real bad thing I did and I just cant deal with it I dont know what too do. And we also did kiss when it wasnt PDA, and I asked if that was cause I coerced her into it and she said no but still im worried I did and that makes me feel even worse and its just all bad. And like sometimes she said no too what I thought was a private kiss and sometimes she said yes so that made me thing I rlly did coerce her but she said that when I wanted too kiss in a seperate room ppl would know where gone so thats why it was a public kiss kinda. But one time we did kiss in a seperate room so idk if that was coercian. Sorry im all over the place. But like we kissed in seperate room once, then she said no for all the other times I asked for seperate room kiss, then we kissed when my brother dropped her off and i was there so I walked her home so we could kiss. Also I think she gave me small kisses in between that I feel bad about cause i feel like that was just coerced. Shes rlly great and is fine and wants me too feel better about this and I do too, I just cant."

Anxiety,School work anxiety,"I have really bad anxiety when getting started with work, once I’ve started it usually smooth sailing but signing into the school website to get the assignment makes me shake and feel like I’m going to vomit. I’m so scared of it and I don’t know why but how do I get over that, it makes me turn in all my assignments late or not at all. How do I get over the starting anxiety? 

I want to say it’s like a band aid but with each click I feel worse and worse until I’m on the brink of collapsing in on myself, it’s way harder than it needs to be. I need to know how to get through it without feeling ill, please."
Anxiety,I told my crush how I felt about them,I feel amazing right now even though she said no. A lot of my anxiety was because of how I felt about her. I think this is the best I felt in a long while. We are still friends which is the one thing I feared wasn't going to continue if I told her.

Anxiety,Electric jaw,Does anyone get like an electric shock in one part of your jaw. It pulses like once or twice then goes away. It’s happened like 15 times today
Anxiety,Yes!,I am struggling with anxiety since my childhood and I have been depressed minimum over three years now.. today got diagnosed and I have got prescribed Elicea and Neurol ! Tomorrow I am starting my treatment.. Hopefully I am gonna feel better.. Anyone been on the same prescriptions? Let me know how are u doing. ❤️
Anxiety,Just breath.,"Sometimes I forget to exhale completely, or at all. I won't realize I'm doing this until I go to take a breath and can't. Panic mode! I can't breath! Eventually, I'll realize what's happening and exhale. I'll then spend the next hour taking in smallish breaths and exhaling them completely to try to regain some calm. I'm not alone in this, right?"
Anxiety,Does this sound like a panic attack?,"I don’t think this breaks the diagnosis rule because I’m not asking for a panic disorder diagnosis and I am just asking if this was similar to a panic attack you may have experienced. I’m gonna start this off by saying; I’m really sorry if I’m overreacting and this wasn’t a panic attack. I have a tendency to be a hypochondriac. 

So it was five AM and I was doing laundry. There was five minutes left on the wash cycle and I just got really anxious suddenly. I couldn’t think straight, I was paseing back and forth really quickly, I was wringing my hands hand out and hitting my collarbone, I was struggling to breath(this could have been because I was trying to choke back my crying so I didn’t wake anyone up), my heart was racing and felt really heavy and weird, and my stomach felt weird. By the time this stopped the clothes were done washing so it was a bit longer than 5 minutes. I’ve had stuff like this happen a couple other times but there usually was a clear reason like i was opening my computer to start schoolwork. 

Thanks a lot. Im sorry if I’m just overreacting about this."
Anxiety,Having problems with the only thing that's been helping me,"I have CPTSD and GAD, and a year ago I developed a panic disorder from a session of Accelerated Resolution Therapy that stirred up a little too much. Since then the only thing that's been consistently helping me is cutting out refined sugar from my diet, a vitamin D and methylated B12 supplement, and a weighted blanket. 

The first weighted blanket I used was borrowed. When I returned it I was gifted another one, same weight but fuzzy cover. Every night I end up taking it off in my sleep because I get too warm. This is in the dead of winter with a fan blowing on me, by the way. 

Also, oddly enough, even though the blanket I was gifted is marked as the same weight as the one I borrowed, it feels significantly lighter. Maybe by five pounds or so. 

I'm not really sure what to do about this, because I haven't been able to work for over a year and so I can't afford to replace the blanket with a different one. I'm feeling my anxiety creeping back in, which is affecting my ability to stay away from sugar and stay hydrated. So the cycle is starting all over again. 

Had anyone else had a problem like this, and if so do you have any advice for me?"
Anxiety,I have no motivation to overcome my Anxiety.,"My anxiety negatively impacts pretty much every area of my life - sleep, schoolwork, relationships, the list can go on and on. And yet, I struggle to find the motivation to do any of the things that could potentially reduce my anxiety (such as take my prescribed medicine regularly, eat meals regularly, or meditate)

Any advice?"
Anxiety,Lexapro fatigue,"Hi, I was hoping you guys could answer a quick question of mine. I was on Lexapro 20 mg for about an year for anxiety and OCD. We weren't able to make any consultations for an year due to Covid-related difficulties. The 20mg dose did produce results but they were inconsistent. When we were finally able to make the consultation, they upped the dose to 30mg which has brought down my general anxiety and obsession-related anxiety quite a bit. But it has also made me feel completely lethargic all day which I suppose is one of its side effects. Since the clinic is some distance away from our house, it'll take 2-3 days to make a consultation. And the local psychiatrist will most probably take me off Lexapro and prescribe another SSRI which is too much of a trouble as I have exams coming up. Is it possible to take a stimulant (like Wellbutrin) to complement Lexapro or is the side effects something I just have to live with?"
Anxiety,Snow gives me anxiety,"I need some advice. 

I have massive anxiety when I drive in the snow. Usually this isn’t a problem because it doesn’t snow when I have work and I used to live really close to family and would get a ride when the weather wasn’t great (I realize I’m very lucky to have this happen).

It snowed pretty heavily yesterday and is still snowing now and will snow pretty much all day (Tuesday) where I live

I work 45 mins away from where I live, the weather is similar but they aren’t predicted to have snow all day. But if you’re from New England or anywhere that gets heavy snow you know the roads aren’t going to be the best at all. 

Work was closed yesterday but seems to be opening late today. I do not feel comfortable driving to work considering the circumstances. I also do not have any other way to get there besides me driving myself. Would I be giving into my anxiety if I ask for the day off?

The type of anxiety I get when driving is the kind that leaves you exhausted for a long time and you feel physically ill. Last time I drove in the snow and had this anxiety I was off for a couple days after. I shake uncontrollably while driving and that is a hazard in itself. 

Please help me decide if I am calling out because of anxiety or weather bc if it’s anxiety I know I have to go."
Anxiety,Will racing thoughts go away in time?,"Hi, i have mild anxiety for about a year. I was used to sleep with headphones listening music, but recently i started sleeping without them, and i find quite big problem for me. 

Racing thoughts...

Do i have hope?

Anxiety,Remembering,"I’m having a hard time rn. It’s 3am and I can’t go back to sleep. I keep thinking about how much I put my ex bf through, but also how much I hid. I’m certain that taking anabolic steroids fkd with me &amp; it exasperated my anxiety to an extreme. I remember being so suspicious of everyone; random girls he’d never even talked to, I’d see them at the gym &amp; my mind would just create some stupid fkn stories. He’d go to the store &amp; I’d have to sit down to journal, internally freaking out, having to talk myself down from my intrusive thoughts. My fear of abandonment reached a level I’d never experienced &amp; idk whether it was the way the steroids destabilized my emotional regulation or because I’d never loved someone as much as I loved him, or both. I was scared all the time. I was having constant panic attacks, experiencing ticks &amp; struggling every day just to feel okay. 

Maybe it was the way the pandemic brought us together in one place so by the time the world started to go back to normal, I was codependent and had separation anxiety? Idk. I’m trying to figure it out. 

All I know is that I drove this wedge between us. I didn’t believe a love like his was real....so when it was there, I doubted it. Maybe it was all of the above; a perfect storm of chemical imbalance, childhood trauma &amp; the pandemic that made me just cling to him in an unhealthy way. 

I waited too long to get on meds. I should have done it sooner. I should have been honest about how strong my thoughts were &amp; how intense the anxiety was getting. Now he’s gone. &amp; I did it. I made him feel like he was the problem. There’s only so much someone can take. He admits that his pride made him do certain things that really fkd me up internally. Like lock his phone, not reassure me, etc. and I being told that the right person will not manage my anxiety (that’s MY job) but will be compassionate to my needs. I know. But it still sucks rn in this moment to think back to how intense those thoughts were. I feel sorry for myself because I was suffering silently for the most part, not being completely honest about my anxiety. But I also feel sorry because he got hurt. And I wish I could fix it. 

I’ve been on meds for almost 3 months now &amp; I’ve got work to do still, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I wish I would have made it sooner. Maybe then...... things would have been different.

[side note: I recognize that he and I not being together is for the best. He wants/needs certain things that cross my boundaries. I also realize that we would have ended anyway. I only wish it hadn’t been in this way, with such pain.]"
Anxiety,Night Time Anxiety,"I feel like my anxiety/panic disorder is 20x worse during night time. More specifically, right before I'm about to go to bed. I'm currently trying to keep myself from having my nightly panic attack and anxiety fit.

It starts off with my body flashing between really cold and really hot. I start to lose feeling in my hands and sometimes experience left arm pain. I can feel my heart start to race and I get a tiny pain near my heart. Then it's just fight or flight. It feels like I'm having a heart attack. I try to stand up and then the hyperventilating starts. I get dizzy, shakey, and experience heart palpitations. The feeling of impending doom sets in. I can't breath, like someone is choking me or there's a ball in the back of my throat. Then I just start sobbing wishing this would finally pass or be over. It's become a nightly thing. I'll jerk myself awake right as I'm falling asleep because it feels like I can't breath and my heart is stopping. I have to pass out from exhaustion to get any amount of sleep.

I've had so many tests done on my heart just in case to try to put my mind at ease. Passed an EKG, stress test, echo, heart holter monitor, etc. I cannot tell you how many different medications I have tried or different kinds of therapy, but nothing has worked so far. I'm at the point where I can't even afford to keep going to the doctor or emergency room either, it's so expensive to try and receive treatment. 

I'm just extremely exhausted and tired of living this way."

Anxiety,Constant need to double check everything- draining my time and confidence,"For my whole life I've had the habit of always having to double-check things, whether it be if I locked the door or if I turned the stove off, but recently it seems it's been getting a lot worse. I'm assuming it has to do with the fact that I'm stuck in my home for the whole day but I don't know what I can do to fix it.

I am constantly double, triple, and even quadruple checking things just in case the last one wasn't sufficient enough. From the same old things such as locking my doors, to newer ones like checking my  messages multiple times to see if I sent a message to the wrong person, it seems my brain can't trust itself in its own actions.

It's gotten to the point where I'm sure I have lost many minutes in a day just making sure that nothing bad could happen from my own mistake which is in itself a mistake I can't fix. I've gotten out of bed sometimes just to make sure I didn't leave the sink tap running.

I've never gotten diagnosed for anything but have not been to a family doctor in a while, and I'm certainly not in a position to do so at the moment. Is there a way to know what my situation is and if any, ways to solve my problem? Thanks"
Anxiety,I had a shower!!,"I never usually talk about this because people would think I’m disgusting, but I’ve always gotten panic attacks in the shower just because it would steam up and I’d find it hard to breath, and today I had a shower for the first time in ages and I’m really proud of myself for getting through it!

Anxiety,Job related anxiety - how do you deal with it?,"Hello there guys! I hope you're doing well.

I've been struggling with job related anxiety for a few years now. The first time I had to deal with anxiety was in my first year of college when I had to find a part-time job. I found it - food delivery. The funny thing is that this should really be a simple job, not in my mind though. Right before going for my first day, I started overthinking and by the time I got to the hub I already knew all the ways the day could've gone wrong. I was already late for work when I decided to bail because I was too afraid of what could happen. This happened two more times since then with 2 other minimum wage jobs (basic jobs where there's no need for any skills). 
A few months ago I decided that I was just lazy, and maybe working from home would be a better fit for me. Guess what? I have an Upwork account and all I have to do is apply for jobs. I know I have the skills, I have experience and knowledge, and yet I'm too afraid to apply. When I find a job I know for sure I can handle, I immediately start self doubting myself. It's like I forget everything I know about my field and I feel like I have no chance of landing the job. And there are gigs a 6 years old could do, but when it comes to applying, I already know I won't be able to handle it, even though I realize later that I was wrong.

My question is, if you had to deal with this, how did you make it work? How do you fight it? 

I mean, at this point, it's not only a matter of meantal health, it's about basic survival too. 

Thanks for your time!"

Anxiety,Visual Noise caused by anxiety - please read,"Hello everyone, I honestly don’t know where else to go but to reach out to anyone on this forum for help. I’m hoping someone can read this and relate to me for some reassurance that I desperately need. Anyways, I’m 25 years old, and I’ve suffered from severe health anxiety for about 3 years now. My anxiety has caused me various health issues over the years, but I’ve conquered each obstacle by either going to a doctor to get my symptoms checked out, or by simply knowing it’s all just created by anxiety. One thing anxiety has taught me is that a lot of issues come from the mind being very negative all the time. Anyways, the most recent issue I’ve been dealing with is something some of you might have heard of before, it’s called visual snow/visual noise. I randomly woke up one day and noticed that my vision was somewhat pixilated when I looked in the dark or at blank walls/dark non vibrant objects. Now this is actually somewhat normal for everyone to a degree. Everyone can experience some form of visual noise and it’s nothing to worry about. When I first discovered visual snow, it caused me a great deal of stress and worsened anxiety, but a year has since passed and it rarely ever bothers me anymore, especially because I barely notice it unless I’m consciously thinking about it. I’ve researched how anxiety can actually cause a lot of different visual issues/disturbances due to heightened senses and over sensitization of vision being constantly in a “fight or flight” response. I actually took peace in knowing this because I improved my visual symptoms and started to desensitize my vision through meditation and other healthy lifestyle changes. On top of that, I recently got an eye exam and was told I have healthy eyes and a healthy optic nerve. I talked to the optometrist about my visual noise and he literally told me to just ignore it, and that I had nothing to worry about. However, I’m stupid and continued to lookup visual stuff online and came across a quora answer from an apparent optometrist who once again said visual noise was nothing to worry about, but he mentioned that using psychedelics could be a cause for some people. Back when I was 20 I tried LSD twice with a couple friends, and never thought anything of it until now. It’s been an entire 4 years between the time of doing LSD and noticing any visual noise/abnormalities. I had perfect vision during that period of 4 years as well. On top of that, at the time I believed that LSD made me happier and helped my anxiety for that year. Anyways, seeing this quora comment has sent me back into a downward spiral of anxiety, regret, and despair knowing that I possibly caused my visual noise from making a dumb mistake and taking LSD years ago in college. The thing is, I’m completely okay living with my visual noise right now, it’s not very noticeable unless I’m thinking about it, and I was actually improving it through simply believing I can heal myself. Now that I’ve seen this comment on psychedelics being a potential cause instead of my current assumption that it was anxiety, I’m freaking out thinking I can never fix/heal myself, and it’s all because of dumb decisions 4 years ago. If anyone took the time to read through this, thank you so much. Right now I’m really looking for positive reassurance from someone who knows what they’re talking about, and who can confirm with me that taking LSD 4 years ago is not the cause of my visual snow. My gut it telling me it’s been my health anxiety all along, but now this other idea has been introduced into my head and it’s got me down in the dumps. I’m only looking for positive reassurance right now, so if you have anything worse or unnecessary to add on that I might see, please don’t. Have a great day everyone."

Anxiety,Irrational work thoughts,"So, I'm 37 and I've been in my field for about 8 years. Worked for a very large company, then moved to a smaller company. The smaller company was super toxic, to the point that a couple of years ago, i had to quit for my own sanity. I spent the next year searching for a job in my field, and am now with an amazing company surrounded by amazing people for about a year now.

The problem here is that I have this anxiety issue now where I think that any little mistake I make, i'm going to be fired and I'm letting everyone in the company down - especially my manager who gave me a shot in the first place. this has stemmed from my last role where my manager would not back me up and others in the company would go over my head to my manager just to show how bad i was (in their eyes), even though i was doing the best I could. it got to a point that my manager at the time threatened to fire me, even though it was the first time in that type of role and some of my stakeholders were notorious for being difficult. 

Now, every time i get reminded that i need to do something or people want an update on something, or maybe I've made a minor error (that's easily fixed), my mind goes back to that low point in my life, where I start thinking ""they are telling you to do this because you can't think for yourself and do it"" or ""you made this mistake, your manager isn't going to trust your work ever again"" or ""they are going to find out that you don't know what you are doing"" to eventually ""these guys deserve someone better than me"". not only this, i also feel like I'm kind of worthless in this company (and life in general these days), especially if I cant get simple things right or if I forget to do something. Totally irrational thoughts....Thoughts that keep me up all night. I get so worked up it feels like i'm having a panic attack. i feel like i'm stressing like this nearly consistently, which will put me in an early grave (IMO)! If I keep this up, I think it's going to get to a point where my company will actually let go of me, eventually. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I deal with this?"

Anxiety,Feeling My Heartbeat when laying down,"I have health anxiety and OCD and am a 27 year old male. 

I have been having weird sensations in my chest over my heart  for a while now, but lately it’s gotten worse. I use to think it was from working out and I had just pulled my pec muscle or it was sore. 

Now when I go to bed and lay down I can often feel my heart beat and it makes it hard to fall asleep. Last night I could hardly sleep because it kept waking me up. 

I’ve had no issues working out and my chest doesn’t bother me during the day when I’m sitting up right. 

I started lexapro last week and wondering if they could just be me getting use to the drug or if I need to follow up with my doctor and have examination done. 

The number one thing I don’t want to happen is the doctor just tells me it’s my anxiety. Has anyone experienced this before with anxiety?"

Worsen it.

Now with the stress from school, the blood has barely slowed me down. Every night I go to bed, I lay there and pick and then can’t sleep because I literally cannot stop. When I have sex with my boyfriend, I pick. Picking makes it easier to hold a conversation too. I pick at any and every point that it is remotely accessible to do so.

Does anyone have any advice to quit this habit? It’s gross and I’m embarrassed about how how raw my fingers look :("
Anxiety,Ups and Downs an exhaust,"I’ve been struggling the last 3-4 years with mainly social anxiety. And it’s pretty exhausting. So I don’t go to school bc anxiety. Every day is the same, I wake up pretty late. Wait for my only friend to come home so we can play games. I used to have a lot of friends but I kinda fell of. Idk what really happened I started to fake sick school on high school more and more and then I stopped completely. And the social anxiety got bigger and bigger . And now I can get anxiety of family members. I have gone to psychologist but I have no idea to express my feelings and how I really feel. And sometimes I’m always happy and some days I just down want to do anything just sleep. I hate my life. I’m currently 17. The most annoying thing is, to see everyone around me succees . I have no idea why? And my parents treat my so extremely good . And a lot of times I get pretty sad bc it feels like I’m always disappointing them. While them treat my like gold. Like I don’t know how I feel. I don’t now why I’m so insecure. And why I have problems with socializing when I was younger I always was the most social kid. It’s so damn exhausting. And I have no idea what to do."
Anxiety,I'm so tired of having anxiety over EVERYTHING.,"Literally everything gives me anxiety. Need to get groceries after work? Anxiety. Housework needs done? Anxiety. Phone call? Anxiety. Talking to anybody? Anxiety. Posting to Reddit? Yep. 

I seriously feel like Oprah is in my brain. You get anxiety! You get anxiety! And you get anxiety! 

I don't know how much more I can take.

Edit: Holy crap, everyone. I never expected this to blow up like it has. I'm trying to read all the responses but it's all so overwhelming. Thank you all for the replies and the awards. It really does mean a ton to me."
Anxiety,I need to get to a dentist,I need to go to dentist I have bad teeth but I haven't been out in 8 years I've tried before and even 6mg of diazipam wasn't enough to help with agoraphobia and anxiety I need surgical done on 1 of the teeth as well this is just a nightmare I'm freaking out
Anxiety,Hi,"I never thought I would be in this kinda sub. I guess some introduction needs to be made. So I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in December last year, I may have suffered longer, probably as back as when I was 8 when parents notice I’ve changed in some ways, but how can I be sure? 

The idea of going to seek professional health started with some strangers I know (that means people I know on the internet). Some suggest that I need to seek help and at first I would say “I’m just depressed and sad,” “I was telling a sad story.” But it develops into thoughts and I said “What if it’s true?” It looks like life for me seems stale, everything I do is just to kill time and I don’t have any joy in them, like games, going to school, et cetera.

So I talk to my mom about it and about I should get checked. So she did some searching and found a center. I went there and did some talking with my mom and therapist. And I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. The depression part is somewhere between stage 2 and 3, now it’s stage 3, I think. 

I’m not sure how to describe it, because my mood goes up and down like I have a fever and cold at the same time, one hour I was okay, then later I could be in tears.

In my opinion, there’re people who had it worse than me, the people who suggest me to seek help is/was depressed themselves and they have done things that can only exist in my thoughts and not action. I’m just here to just talk about it, I talk about it to some of my classmates, my parents, my therapist, the teachers know too. 

Don’t know how this will end up, I may get some support from you guys, or I can get my dms flooded saying “you ain’t depressed,” “you seeking attention.” But whatever, what I do, Ig I’ll have to take responsibility for it, at least that’s what people say."

Anxiety,Lasea,"Hi all,

Ive suffered with anxiety and slight depression, and a little bit of ADHD. I have been medication free for over a year now- I was on Sertraline for 10 years. I was doing so well without medications until COVID. I moved to Germany a few months ago and just finally received insurance and went to a doctor. Im from the US - where they easily prescribe medications. Here however, they would like to try a more natural route vs chemicals right away. The doctor here prescribed Lasea. Has anyone taken this? And if so, how do you feel? Today was my first day.. its supposed to take about 2 weeks to kick in. The only thing Ive noticed after day one is that I keep burping lavender, LOL.

Appreciate any help or advice!!"

Anxiety,"Paranoid about a cat scratch, and overthinking about rabies.","Hi, I am 18, and from the Philippines,
Yesterday my cat pooped on the floor, so I cleaned it and wash her butt and tail because a poop got stuck on her tail, and she accidentally scratched my hand, the scratch pretty much bleed a little bit, but it's shallow, and after that I started to overthink and research the whole day about rabies, I have OCD, and this really triggered my OCD and I am out of treatment at the moment.

My mother's friend got bit too, while he is sleeping the cat bit him, but he doesn't seem to care about it. 
The cat is not aggressive whatsoever, she meows a lot but she does that if she's hungry, we will gonna vaccinate her next week due to covid here in my town it got postponed, and I got scratched last month too and bleed, but nothing happened.

Someone threw the cat in front of our house so we adopted it, she's pretty clingy and no sign of rabies whatsoever, and she doesn't have any kind of foam on her mouth, not aggressive, agitated or anything. But shes unvaccinated at the moment which worries me, but she hasn't died since I've been scratched last month never got outside the house ever and she's still a kitten so no exposure to feral animals I presume. 

So what do you think?

And according to cdc even if the animal has rabies, if it's in incubation period, it can't infect anyone because the virus hasn't reach the saliva and the brain, and ahe doesn't display any rabid symptoms and when I got scratched I hold her for a minute and at that time if she licked her claws the saliva already dried down and rabies can't survive open air and die instantly after several seconds, and I am in open water when I got scratched.
And this paranoia made me overthink about my saliva and I can't stop swallowing and feeling the sensation of my saliva. Damn I am tripping hard.

Man fuck me I want this to stop"

Anxiety,Weed anxiety,"

Hey guys. 

I've been on 50mg for 10 weeks now and I'm doing a lot better then I was at the start. Definitely have seen some improvement. 

There's still some days I feel down but there not as bad as they were a few weeks ago. 

There is one thing I would like to ask you guys, I don't know how to explain it but I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this.... 

There's like this place in my mind I can go to, it's kind of more like a feeling then a thought if that makes sense. Which makes my head feel tight and then I start to have a attack. It concerns me that I can bring it on just by going there and because of my anxiety and ocd I can't stop obsessing over it and thinking everyday that there is something wrong with me or I've tapped into a part of my brain that I shouldn't have and now I won't be able to stop. 

This all started for me when I was smoking weed and I had a massive panic attack, then the days after I couldn't stop having panic attacks then came the depression then came the anxiety, and I'm still trying to get over it. 

If anyone else has been through the same or feel the same I would love to hear from you so I don't feel like I'm alone in this. I'm just so constantly worried that I'm going to be stuck like this and no one understands what I'm talking about."
Anxiety,No Energy,"I never have any energy even when I get 8+ hours of sleep every night. I’m currently on Effexor 187.5 mg (increased dose for about 4 weeks) but not seeing any improvement. I have been on this dose before and it worked but since then I’ve gone up and down and I just don’t think it’s working anymore. I had bloodwork done and none of my levels are low or anything.

I’m scared. I just feel like a lot of the things that can usually help anxiety take so long to implement and while working full time it’s going to be even more difficult to come off Effexor and try something new. I am trying to start therapy as well since my work comes with a plan. It’s just a lot to think about and a lot to do and having no energy to start with is a pain everyday. I do have some days that are a little bit better than others but most days at work I deal with shortness of breath, chest tightness/pain at times, dizziness, etc. Plus low/no energy of course.

Anyone else relate to any of this? I’m just stuck. I’m losing motivation for my future goals."

Anxiety,Anxiety about life,"Since the COVID lockdown I’ve been struggling with comprehending that life is actually real? It’s like I suddenly remember I’m actually here and space is actually real and life itself is so insane. I never really thought about it recently. But it’s bringing me lots of anxiety and I’m really not here for it. I meditate daily and try to accept the feelings. 
I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else ? Especially during the lockdowns. I’m generally fine when I’m with out for a socially distanced walk with my friend. But it’s like I’m constantly thinking about the fact that life is actually real, but not in a good way?

Anxiety,Need help and advice on how to cope,"Well to start off, Im a university student and ive been having these attacks for years but it got worse during quarantine. 
Its mostly just anxiety about my existense,i can manage this part, but then my mother kept having attacks from her ailments(we still dont know the cause) and it mostly occurs in the middle of the night.I would wake up alarmed and with slight panic trying to stabilize my mother. From then on i opted not to sleep at night but even during the day i havent manage to sleep peacefully. Then it got worse, ill manage to sleep but very lightly, my overthinking got worse, and my sleep will get interrupted just by any alarming sound that i will hear, even if im unconsious. Im also restless if im left alone with my mother, overthinking that i wont know what to do and be overwhelmed. 
So this keeps happening and happening and i dont know what to do. I feel physically and psychologically tired. Sleeping is my only solace but thats also plagued by my anxiety. 
I tried those diary shits and i tried to reach out to my friends but it just wont work. I tried to discuss this with my parents, and yeah, they just dismissed it. I feel so cornered. 

Im sorry if this is incomprehensible. This is also my first time doing this. I resorted to reaching out to internet because i cant expect anything from my circle. 
Please help me."
Anxiety,"If my anxiety isn't my fault, then it's unfair that the onus is on me to get myself out of it everyday.","Today while consoling me, someone reassured me that my anxiety isn't my fault.
Later she went on to say, that unless I'm the one who is taking active steps to help myself, it won't get better. 

I get it, this comes from a place of concern, but it's so unfair. I don't mean to compare, but it's unfair that it's not even my fault and I have to put in so much everyday to have a normal day (not even a happy one), and I fail even at that. I see others, blissfully unaware of how lucky they are that they aren't worried about anxious thoughts, panic attacks or the fact that they haven't spent one day in 2020-21 without crying.
They have their own struggles, yes, it's incomparable. But for once, I wish to not worry about something that isn't my own doing. 

If I'm not responsible, having the onus to get myself out of it every single day is unfair. I'm doing it for myself, I'd still do it, but that doesn't take away the fact that I absolutely hate this and want to rant about it time to time."
Anxiety,The worst 5/6 months I have had in my life . Want advise on moving forward,"Hello peeps. I (26M) was recently diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression the last September. Dealt with some pretty bad days for a couple of months and the troubling part of it was having 30k average steps in a day without leaving my house at all. After the 2 months I decided to move back to my hometown and with my parents( which is very common in my country). I came back October 29th quarantined for 10 days. within 3 days after my quarantine and testing negative, my dad caught covid from somewhere.  He was admitted in the hospital on nov 15th, and had severe covid. Me and my mom tested positive for asymptomatic covid and were fine. My dad passed away on December 2nd and my anxiety turned into trauma and paranoia about covid. Dealt with extreme panic attacks and trauma for a few days. The peak of the attacks was when my brother who was living abroad came back to my hometown and I had a mental breakdown for an entire day and a half in fear of him getting infected. I spent the majority of January in therapy and still having extreme anxiety.. I am still in constant fear of covid that hasn’t reduced. I am scared of getting reinfected/ spreading it my brother as he didn’t test postive. I started work and am going back to work but am still am paranoid about it. I try not reading about covid and stuff but curiosity gets the better of me. Reassurance has been working but it only helps in the moment. 

Since the past few weeks, when ever I have a anxiety attack I’m seeing a lot physical symptoms. I end up puking whenever I have the smallest panic/anxiety attack. The nausea is very intense and anxiety medication was making it worse. Need some advise/motivation to move forward."

Anxiety,"I thought I only had social anxiety, but now I wonder if I also have GAD","Since I was 12 I've battled constantly with serious social anxiety. Around age 18, after years of therapy and exposure, I finally was able to substantially overcome it. I thought that was what was causing all my strife, and that now at age 19 I would be able to continue on my life the way I've always hoped. But instead, I find myself getting upset over trivial things, and experiencing general anxiety about work, school, or the future. I feel like every action I take is going to affect my future, and that if I fail at any minor task it will hurt my chances of having a successful life. It makes me wonder if I should go back to a different therapist, which scares me because it feels like that's admitting that this is something that I'll never be able to overcome. I've worked so tirelessly to overcome my social anxiety, and realizing that isn't the only issue I have makes me feel so hopeless."
Anxiety,Clenching butt,Why does my butt always clench up whenever i dont want it to. This may sound weird but i dont like when my butt clenches up because my penis also lifts up. I have this fear that one day i will do it purposely near people. eveytime like when i wake up my butr clenches randomly when i dont want it too or when im just sitting and i dknt enat it to clench it still does. Is this due to anxiety. How come it only happens when i fear of clenching my butt
Anxiety,I sometimes expect (fear) the worst in people,"I sometimes get dramatic and overly anxious because I assume the worst of people. Anybody else deal with this? What has helped you?

For example, I have random thoughts that a neighbor that filed a noise complaint on me might key my car. Or that someone who doesn’t like me will randomly start a rumor about me at school or try to get me fired at work. I begin to obsess and worry over these thoughts. 

I’m not sure if these are considered intrusive thoughts. But these thoughts are backed by some “logic” where I use that little logic I have and take off to create my own fears"
Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety from the unknowns of what comes after life?,For some reason I can seem to shake this thought. I think about it daily. While I know it’s out of my control it still gives me an unsettling feeling. Anyone else?
Anxiety,"My relationship with my mom is increasingly strained due to her mental health issues, and it fucking sucks.","Hi, I’m 17, and I live with my mom. I’ve been diagnosed with autism and anxiety for years now, and I’ve been suspecting I have ADHD for a few months now (obviously will get professionally tested sometime soon to find out for sure!) My mom suffers from pretty bad anxiety and depression, but only got diagnosed in the last couple years, and she hasn’t been taking her medications regularly. My mom got behind on her house payments, and in hindsight was basically pressured by a realtor acquaintance of hers to sell her house last year. We had to move pretty suddenly into a smaller house, and we were going to lay low for a while, work on repairing her credit score, etc. Then, my mom lost her job less than a month after moving. My mom didn’t have a job for over a year, and it took a huge toll on her mental health. That combined with what I now feel are ADHD symptoms from my end, and general anxiety surrounding cleaning, and the pandemic starting, the house became extremely messy and cluttered. Piles of trash in every room, that kind of thing. My mom took all of this very much to heart, and she felt that the house and her not having had a job made her a failure, and her anxiety attacks made her “a boob”. Over the last year, my mom has confided in me a couple different times that her father and one of his friends sexually abused her when she was young. I believe this has had a major affect on how my mom sees herself and views situations. My mom finally got a job in October, but it’s a job that is pretty demanding of her physically and mentally, and she’ll often come home from work and either vent about her day and then sleep, or just fall asleep. In the mornings when she’s getting ready for work (or if she’s “antsy” to get out of the house and go somewhere) she can have a very short temper and be very snappy, something she inherited from my grandma. Anyways, all of this has led to the hell that has been the last couple months. In December, we got a notice from our landlord saying that they’d be doing an annual inspection. Our house was still extremely messy (and we have cats that we’re not supposed to have), so we managed to get a couple extensions to the date by lying about quarantining out of just total desperation. It took a couple weeks to get started on cleaning, so we ended up cleaning almost our entire house over the course of a weekend by ourselves). It’s now January 15-ish, we get our cats to a hotel, the inspection is today, everything should be good, right? About an hour before the inspection is supposed to take place, the landlord contacts us saying they can’t do the inspection that day, because they don’t have a mask on them (lmaooo). So, we reschedule, and get our cats to a hotel again. This took another week and a half. I had a pretty relaxing weekend for the first time in a month and a half, but yesterday my mom got another email saying that they’re doing a follow-up inspection, and the leftover non-trash clutter (we had to abandon it because we were physically exhausted at the end of the weekend and still had to get our cats to the hotel) and our garage had to be cleaned up and organized by February 18, or they will proceed with an eviction (even though evictions are banned in our state through March lol). All of this has taken a huge toll on my mom since December. She’s constantly cycling between being angry, short-tempered, crying, or just being depressed and apathetic. She’s had several panic attacks in her sleep where she violently shakes in the bed and groans really loud, including two just this last night. I spent most of last night up with her, and I’ve missed today and most of the school days in January as a result of the inspection and trying my best to help my mom with her mental health. The only time of day when I feel relaxed is late at night when she’s asleep. Unfortunately, my mom has been really anxious about that too. It’s like even when she’s asleep, she can sense when I’m up, and she doesn’t get any sleep because of it. She wakes up multiple times a night, and comes into my room to tell me to go to bed. It sucks, I want her to get good sleep, but the only time of day I can relax, be alone, and really be myself is late at night. I always feel like I’m walking on eggshells around her. I’m always nervous that if I say or do the wrong thing, she’ll have an anxiety attack or get angry. I’ve changed the way I talk to sound more like “I did this” rather than “this happened” so that my mom can’t put the blame on herself, even if she had a part in it. I genuinely feel that I’m doing pretty good with my mental health aside from my mom. It’s fucking exhausting always being the beacon of positivity and optimism, and I seriously hope things improve in late February, March, and beyond.

Oh, and also, I’m always on edge, waiting for the next bad thing or major change to happen. We moved into our current house in fall 2019, we bought our car in the summer of last year, and I started at a new school in fall 2019. Nothing feels stable, every major life thing has happened in the past 1 and a half years."

Anxiety,Health anxiety: any advice for dealing with odds?,"One of the BCRA gene mutations runs in my family. I may or may not have it, I don't know. I'm a male, so it's less urgent for me to check for my own sake (should do it before I get kids though, maybe). Even so, BCRA poses raised cancers risks for men too; particularly raised risk of prostate cancer, up to 15 - 20 percent. I'm not that worried about that though, will get checked regularly when I'm older I guess. 

However, what worries me right now is the slightly increased odds of pancreatic cancer (normal is 1.5 percent, BRCA is 2 - 5 percent) simply because I find this cancer way scarier. It's worrying me to an extent right now that I can't really enjoy my night.

Just the idea that I'm more at risk than average feels like a sword over my head, even though it's such a tiny amount. How do you deal with 'odds anxiety' of this scope?"

Anxiety,Im really struggling,"Ive been dizzy for the past month. At first it wasnt bad, it would go away when i would eat, and then i would forget about it. Then one day suddenly when i was at the gym it just hit me full blown and wouldnt stop. After laying down for an hour, it finally calmed down, but i could still feel it lingering. That was early January, now i have been struggling with it since then. It felt like it was going away 2 weeks ago, then suddenly came back full blown, and i feel has gotten worse since the first time. I cant concentrate, i constantly feel fuzzy and like something is pulling me down to the left. I cry almost everyday because its torture. My doctor doesnt know whats wrong with me, and to make matters worse i have no health insurance and barely any money. I feel that i get no relief, unless im asleep. Im terrified that i will be stuck like this, and suicide will be the only way out. I feel like i am going through this by myself.

Anxiety,Bad Anxiety During COVID,"So I am a 27 year old dude from Canada and I have been unemployed since March last year and in the beginning of lockdown I was enjoying it, playing video games all day, watching anime and TV but now a year later i'm still unemployed and my depression and anxiety have really hit me hard more than it ever has.

I keep on geting racing thoughts about how I wasted my early 20's being depressed and playing WoW all day for 4 years until 2016 when I finally got my shit in gear and graduated with a 2 year diploma and got a great IT job before I even graduated but then 2020 happened and now i feel like i'm back at square one.

I had plans of finally getting into shape and finally look at dating but I feel like my anxiety is taking hold of me and nothing means anyuthing to me. I went on anti depressants in January and they have helped a lot but these thoughts of being where I am at at 27 have really bothered me.

I look at streamers and youtubers who are successful at 19 and get to play video games for a living and it bothers me that I never got into streaming in my early 20s because that sort of job is impossible to someone my age.

I loved my IT job also and it really helped me ignore my failed past but I just feel so lost now. I think about how I wasted time all the time but never think about how I improved myself and got myself out of that rut previously but now it just feels hopeless and I worry my time is running out.

I only enjoy the time I have playing video games with my friends now a days and the rest of the time I just sit on reddit all day and hope that something positive happens to me but a year later with no job in sight I feel lost and lonely.

I just want to know if anyone else is going through this sorta of thing? where you have all this free time and all you can think about are the negatives and feel like your wasting even more time thinking about the negatives. Does anyone have any tips to get through this?"
Anxiety,SSRI Not Working,"Hello, I started taking fluoxetine for my anxiety mid October. I had been taking Klonopin and it was wonderful but not something I wanted to be on long term for everyday anxiety.  Also coming off it was terrible. 

When I started taking fluoxetine it was weeks before I started noticing any difference and at first my anxiety got worse. Then about 6 weeks in (on a dose of 20mg) I had about 3 weeks where I felt wonderful. Hardly any anxiety at all. I could actually breathe and I was HAPPY. Then, after that 3 weeks of bliss, my anxiety slowly began creeping up again and at this point it’s worse than it’s ever been. 

This is my first time on a SSRI and I’m wondering if this is normal and I just need a higher dose, or if this means the medication isn’t the one for me? Any thoughts or experiences are greatly appreciated."

Anxiety,Crippling anxiety for two weeks straight,"This is my first time posting here, and I’m looking for advice and words of encouragement about how I’ve been feeling lately. 

About two weeks ago, my anxiety began to flare up for the first time in years. I began taking my lexapro (20 mg) again two weeks ago today, and my psychiatrist prescribed me buspirone (5mg) two weeks ago and also Lamictal (25mg) last Wednesday. However, I feel like my anxiety hasn’t had any improvements. Every waking hour is spent worrying incessantly that I’m never going to feel the same as before ever again. I can’t eat, sleep terribly, and have great difficulty focusing on schoolwork (I’m in my last semester of senior year). I feel enormous amounts of dread and hopelessness and just want to know that it will get better, but every morning that I wake up feeling the same as the day before feels like a punch in the stomach. I feel trapped and everything that used to bring me joy I can’t even bring myself to do. Will my medication take longer to start helping? Should I have seen improvements already? I just want to feel happy again."

Anxiety,Lysol in the dishes,"I've got some health anxiety and my girlfriend and I recently uprooted from our apartment while we try to get the landlord to fix an issue there and are staying at my stepfather's mother's home (the only place that would take us in). I caught her cleaning one of the mugs out with Lysol, rinsing it, and putting it back in the cabinet. I smelled it afterward and it still smelled like Lysol. I am very concerned about either me or my girlfriend ingesting Lysol while we're here. There are also grandchildren that come here and eat off the dishes. What is the best way to handle this? I'm concerned about a confrontation (the lady is very conservative and somewhat passive-aggressive). We could also get plastic/paper things to eat off of but that might also raise questions and it wouldn't help out the grandchildren."
Anxiety,I can’t stand this anxiety and insomnia.,"It’s 1:40 in the morning (Korean standard time), yet I’m still wide awake.  I just can’t convince myself to fall asleep even though I’m tired.  I fear the next day because If I don’t get sleep, I’ll be panicking tomorrow.  How do I get to sleep even when I’very taken Xanax and that doesn’t seem to work?"
Anxiety,Unable to pick up phone calls from family,"Hello.

I am unable to call or receive calls from anyone (however I do not have issues with making appointments). It was my birthday on Saturday and 3 of my family members called me, I did not pick up and simply stared at my phone in a panicky state until the call dropped. After which I proceeded to guilt trip myself, saying that I'm missing up on opportunities to bond with them, that they'll die soon (which only applies to 1 caller as they're older) and I'll regret this for the rest of my life. I get severe anxiety from everything and anything and so I cocoon myself away. Although I guilt trip myself and drive myself into a breakdown, I am still unable to pick up the phone, even when I know that they're simply calling to wish me a happy birthday. It pains me to ignore their calls, but every time I get a call, my limbs go numb, I struggle with breathing, my chest hurts and eventually I dissociate. I've never been close to my family and I've lived apart from them since the age of 14, but recent years I've felt extremely lonely so I've been trying to spend more time with them (which I've miserably failed at).

I'm not sure what to do or how to cope. I'm a grown ass woman and I'm tired of living this way. For context, I have diagnosed cPTSD and BPD. I am receiving therapy.

I'm not sure if I even want help or advice (but please do share if you have some), maybe just vent because of how devastated I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend so much time thinking about how lonely I am and yet- every time I receive a phone call, my world collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading I guess, hope you have a better day."
Anxiety,What are some good ways to keep yourself motivated?,"I have this problem, and it could also be depression, ADHD, or aspergers, but I figured asking you guys here wouldn't hurt. How do you guys keep yourselves motivated? Because for me, it could be anything, schoolwork, video games, DnD, etc, no matter what I do I end up getting tired quickly. I always end up rushing through it just to be done, micromanaging one tiny detail for over an hour, worrying about whats next and giving up, or getting started on whatever I'm doing only to get distracted or bored.

I've tried taking medication, Vyvanse, and it still impacts this, just in a different way. I lose all sense of a work, play balance and refuse to relax until I'm finished. This can take thirty minutes to five hours depending on if I get overwhelmed with worries and slow down or quit, if I end up micromanaging one tiny detail, or maybe I just rush through everything to relax, only to be on edge for the rest of the day because I rushed through everything.

So how do you guys keep yourselves motivated, on task, or keep yourself moving at a steady pace? Any advice is appreciated.

(Excuse any bad grammar or spelling.)"

Anxiety,"My fiancé's anxiety is beginning to wear me down and I'm not sure how to handle this. You should never say that anyone's anxiety that they can't control is becoming a burden to you, but it really is.","I'm currently dealing with a situation when it comes to my fiancé's anxiety. We have been together almost 5 years and plan on getting married this summer. It seems now more than ever that her anxiety is more frequent and I can tell that it's taking a toll on me.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, the first year or two we were dating, I had little to no idea she had anxiety. Whether this mean she did not feel comfortable sharing it with me, or it has gotten worse over time, who knows. But for a little while, I was basing our relationship off the idea that anxiety wasn't a thing, and when it became more of a thing, it was small. I like to say I'm easy going and somewhat worry free, so I don't deal with these stresses at all. I can go throughout my daily life without worrying about things. I get that's a bold, possibly infuriating thing to say in a subreddit called ""Anxiety"", but I'm just trying to explain the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the last year or so (we've been engaged for about a year and a half at this moment in time). It seems like everything with her anxiety has been turned to 11. Factor in the pandemic AND planning a wedding, yikes.

&amp;#x200B;

We've officially gotten to a point that she's terrified to go to work, and comes home crying or upset more often then not. She can't text her friends or coworkers without overthinking what she's saying, in which she always wants me to proofread everything to make sure it's fine. She can't have basic conversations with her friends, who will love her no matter what, without questioning everything she said and let it eat her alive the entire night after. Basically anything to do with COVID, whether it be going out to places, seeing people, or even little things like having our dog go to day care in fear that he will come back ""infected"", it's non-stop all the time. Planning the wedding has been a nightmare on it's own. She's terrified to make any sort of decision that doesn't result in almost crippling stress and anxiety. Even something as small as ""what should the color of my bridesmaids dresses be"", which has now been an anxiety inducing topic for months now.

&amp;#x200B;

As selfish as it sounds, I'm at my wits end with it. My ability to enjoy doing things or even normal day-to-day life has been impacted hard by this. I shouldn't say she is a burden, but it really is. I'm at a point where I don't want to do anything which may cause anxiety because I don't want to have to deal with it, but then I'm upset and bitter that we aren't doing anything. The ""price that I pay"" afterwards when we do anything truly isn't worth the fun of going to do something. And even when we don't do something, it just seems like there's ALWAYS something happening or about to explode.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling extra defeated because I've tried to research what to do as a fiancée and future husband to someone who has anxiety, and basically every article I'm finding says ""don't make them think they're a burden, and you just have to be there for them"". Okay, but what if I'm at the point where I truly can't do that anymore? \*crickets\*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm asking at this point because I'm at a total loss. Obviously I don't want this to be over, I love her, but I'm at my end right now. How do you tell someone with anxiety ""hey I want to be here for you, but you're too much and I can't be. But I also don't want this to be over"".

&amp;#x200B;

\*yes she is in therapy for this, no it doesn't seem to be getting better. Like one thing will start to get better while 2-3 things get worse along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: This also triggers fears for me for the future. If she's this bad at having anxiety about ""small"" things now, will having kids be a nightmare? Will I not be able to spend time with my kids and enjoy doing this if I'm just having to worry about how she's doing the entire time as well? I feel like I'm emotionally carrying the both of us at this point but everything I'm reading basically says ""deal with it"", with no helpful advice after that."
Anxiety,Your physical symptoms of anxiety or a panic attack coming?,"Anyone want to share their physical symptoms with me? Just wondering how far anxiety can go when it comes to the physical side.

For me, i usually feel sweaty, flushed, clammy hands and my muscles get stiff/sore.. Sometimes feel feverish or sick even."
Anxiety,I feel like I'm broken because of anxiety,"I work nights and my family works/goes to school during the day.  I feel so alone.  I don't have any close friends and I just sit around being anxious all day.  I've never felt so alone before.  I spend time posting to reddit in hopes that there will be someone who understands me.  I've gotten some really friendly comments but I really don't know what to do in my down time.  I can't get motivated to do house work, I'm on medication,  I meditate, i journal, i try to ground myself but everything just feels so off right now.  My heart feels like it's going to explode.  I really really need a support system but I don't really have one.  I wish I knew someone in a similar situation that could chat with me and tell me everything is going to ok, and maybe share some experiences.   My kids are struggling because of covid isolation, and my marriage is in pretty bad shape.  I see a counselor but she doesn't really seem to help very much.  My wife and I are in marriage counseling but that doesn't seem to help much either.  I just feel so damn sad and scared all the time.  I wish I had a friend group to help me through this."

Anxiety,How to start reassuring and validating myself,"So I’ll keep this short n sweet; I recently came to a realization that in my relationship, whether it comes to every argument or disagreement with my partner, I always go to my brothers and friends to vent. But, it isn’t ONLY venting; it’s seeking approval or validation for how I’m feeling. And from there, based on their opinions, what I should do next.

&gt; recent example is my partner has some toxic traits that made being in the relationship tough for me, I figured she knew how bad they were and just kinda was ignoring them, so I went to break up with her. Turns out she didn’t know how bad it truly was since I never explicitly had a TALK talk about them, and she agreed to seek help to better herself and we can try and see if we can make our relationship work.

One brother sounded a bit distasteful with my choice to give her a chance (she reminds him of his toxic ex due to some traits, but she IS NOT HIS EX as a person) one was kinda eh but understood, and one straight up said “dude I don’t give a fuck about your relationship. You do what you think is right because I assure you I’m not always thinking about your relationship, I got my own stuff to worry about to. Just give it a shot, see how it goes, and that’s it.” Brother #2 (Eh Brother) basically agreed with him when I told him his reaction and Distateful Brother I didn’t touch back with. One friend said he wishes us luck and it’s within my right to give another chance and another basically said “I give it two months and I’m not kidding. You made a mistake imo”

&gt;another example is my two sister in laws and all my brothers think my partner is being stubborn for not doing X or Y to make up with my mom over some tension between them (long story short: my mom talked bad about my partner to me, I didn’t want my partner coming over while my mom felt this way and acting fake, so I told her). And it feels like everyone around me was just like “fuck your partner” and in a way made me feel like that’s how I should feel too because we are all super family oriented while she isn’t. In the end, the situation sounds like it’ll at least come to a civil talk sometime soon. Resolution? Who knows, but it’s the talk that matters.

Overall, the main reason I’ve been feeling so conflicted after the make-up is because I felt like not breaking up was a mistake. But why? My rational side is because I don’t want to waste her time and in the end hurt her even more if this doesn’t work out. I want her to be okay. She knows the risks just as well as me so I’m kinda slowly passing these sad and negative feelings now

My anxiety-side says why? Because everyone around me was distasteful of her? Because some people acted as if I made a mistake? I realized for almost my whole life..I sought their approval for the way I acted in important times of crisis; arguments with my mom, gf, etc. I sought their validation for my feelings and actions and if they disagreed, I second guessed myself and my anxiety and overthinking skyrocketed.

For anyone who has dealt with the same, how did you get past this? I came to the realization and am soon seeking therapy for anxiety in general, but ik the road to fully being okay with this may be a long one"

Anxiety,Shaking sucks,"I have noticed for awhile now since I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety that I will shake my legs the moment I begin to eat.

It’s like I feel nervous but happy when I eat, like my brain gets confused. Can anyone relate?"
Anxiety,health anxiety and paranoia,"Hi! I’m not usually the one to post my personal issues online but some recent events led me to posting on here. 

I’ve always had horrible health anxiety, if get a singular pain it sends me into a panic thinking I’m having a heart attack, stroke, or anything deadly. I’ve tried changing how I think about death and I’ve tried a few tactics to help calm my anxiety but I don’t know how much longer I can take having 3-6 anxiety attacks a day. to add onto that I’ve been extremely paranoid lately, constantly scanning rooms before I enter them, heightened hearing, I’m set into fight or flight mode very easily, and I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me which has led me to sleep with my light on every night for a month. I’m thinking it’s possible that it has to do with some trauma i experienced in the past. Anyways, I’d appreciate anything at this point. I’m wondering if anyone has experienced things like this and even better how did they learn to cope or even get rid of the anxiety."
Anxiety,Just started fluoxetine (Prozac) and I'm wondering what to expect,"I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder a couple of years ago, worked on my mental health on my own for some time before starting regular therapy in Jan 2020, and I've recently been prescribed meds for anxiety.

For context: I have always been a very high-functioning person, borderline overachiever despite my anxiety, but 2020 really got the best of me. In the past few months, I've stopped going the extra mile for work, I struggle to connect with the things I was once passionate about. I feel like I'm trapped in my mind with anxious, negative thoughts.

My therapist and psychiatrist say the meds are necessary right now and I've gotten started on fluoxetine (Prozac, known as Prodep where I live) on the new year. I would love to know your experiences with the meds, did it help? Were there side effects? Did you see improvements?"
Anxiety,Dating with anxiety,"I (19M) have severe social anxiety and it is really affecting my dating life, I've never had anything close to a relationship and I feel a huge need  to experience dating and relationship. 


But for me, communicating with anyone is extremely difficult, I'm really awkward and rude without wanting too (how I cope with the anxiety ig) and it's even more difficult when I'm trying to talk to someone I'm interested in, I mean nearly impossible, and even if the girls is interested and giving me signal I won't even understand them and if I do, I will just get frozen. 

So alchool and drug kinda help me talk to girl but I know it's not the best way to cope. But I feel like it's the only way.

So I've never asked a girl out before in fear of being rejected, I need advice. (I have diagnosed severe social anxiety and taking meds for it but still really affecting me on a daily basis)"
Anxiety,I posted last year that I was anxious to get a new debit card,"I got one but since then it's been non stop trouble with it. I got it because I did not want to rely on Mum to get things for me online. I had one before but when I tried to use it to sign up with Paypal I kept getting errors. When I tried to discuss it with the bank, I had a panic attack and stormed out. Then I couldn't use the card and it expired.
Last year I thought I'd push myself to get a new one and hopefully I won't have the same trouble with it. Things went ok with ordering things online but around November last year I was trying to type in the number to make an order on Ebay, I kept getting errors. I argued with the bank on the phone over it paranoid that my card had been hacked into they assured me nothing had happened. Because of the errors I had to get a new card. Get the new card, things are OK again, card works.
Then tonight I get an email from the post office that a 'parcel from Tony is being prepared'. I did not order anything from Tony. The last few times I used the card online were last weekend via 3 clothing stores none of which had the name 'Tony'. Now again I am sick to the stomach and paranoid that my card is being hacked into and my money is gone. I tried calling the bank and they will not answer (it's Sunday night over here). Now I probably won't sleep tonight. Last time I called them over paranoia of being hacked I had an all mighty screaming and crying meltdown with the lady on the phone because of my anxiety, I don't want that to happen again. 

I try to push myself and to take risks as I keep being told to do. 'You'll never know if you don't try' I get told over and over again. They always backfire, always. Something as small as putting myself out there, or having hobbies, or 'trying' just ends in shit."
Anxiety,Chest pain without panic attack symptoms?,"New user here. Earlier today, I had a sudden sharp pain in my left chest (heart) area, while I was sitting on my bed.

I am a pretty anxious person, and my work has been particularly stressful recently. I've been looking into psychiatric help for the past week or two, but now I'm even more motivated to do so.

I hope I can make more sense of this here. I've never had this type of problem before. Not sure if it's related to anxiety or anything mental. Took blood pressure 5+ minutes after it stopped, results were fine. I am 24 years old, normal weight, and do not have a history of heart problems."

I was doing fine for weeks only feeling this way for part of the day and just gradually got worse and now it’s not going away and I’m really scared which is causing me to panic more.

Just a month ago I was anxious due to heath issues but feeling like myself. Physical symptoms worry me but I can deal with them but mental symptoms I can’t handle.

I've been biting my nails recently whcih is an old habit but I need something to do with my hands. My current job is front line and very much covid facing so this is now quite a dangerous habit to have. 

So, my best friend bought me a pea pod for Christmas that you can pop the peas out of, and I've attached it to my phone case.

Anxiety,Heart palpitations can’t sleep,"I’m honestly not sure if this is Anxiety related or not but did some googling and saw that lots of ppl that share similar symptoms relate it to Anxiety. Anyway for the last around two or three weeks I have been suffering from slight chest pain and palpitations, especially while I sleep. I was getting rather concerned so I ended up going to the emergency room one day. They did blood test ran blood pressure and heart rate, ECG scan and everything came back normal besides palpitations. Ever since I have been having a hard time sleeping and am starting to wonder if this is or isn’t something related to Anxiety. I’ve never really felt like a person that suffered from Anxiety but with current events and my graduation coming soon I’m not sure if the pressure is causing this. I’m curious if anyone has some advice, it is currently 3 am and I don’t see myself sleeping anytime soon"
Anxiety,"Does anyone else get so worked up on anxiety that you just want to scream or punch something or cry, but nothing helps and I can’t even cry?","I had anxiety back in 2015-early 2016, but it had been gone for that nearly 5 years until a couple weeks ago. I have been up since about 3 and I can’t sleep. I am so exhausted. I have so much anxiety, but it is making me filled with maybe adrenaline or something? I don’t know, but I’m antsy. I can’t sit still and I feel like I need a release that I can get. Does anyone else experience this?"

Anxiety,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANXIETY AND SELF SABOTAGING,"Hey guys I wanna talk about what I've learned this past years from people who are dealing with anxiety so their Anxiety patterns has a reason which most of the time is to block them or sabotage them from reaching a certain goals because unconsciously they don't feel comfortable in a certain situations, I think if you guys wanna cure your anxiety and other confident issues you're dealing with you have to do some shadow work on yourselves and discovering your hidden resistance that keep holding you back no matter how you try to step outside and achieving your Dreams. 

If you wanna know more about this you can chat me :)"
Anxiety,Sending love ❤️,"I just had a talk with my sister about mental illness and was sitting on Reddit thinking about all of the people on here (including myself) with anxiety and my heart was touched. 

You guys are so strong to keep striving every day even when you’re mind and body are fighting against you in even the simplest of tasks. Even when you’re feeling overwhelmed and concerned with how you will move forward. What’s going on with you isn’t fair and it stinks to know that others can simply live their lives much more easily than we can, but you’re here and you’re trying. 

Just know that some random girl at four in the morning with tears in her eyes is thinking of you and loves you. I know this might not mean anything, but I just wanted to share. Keep going, keep trying. It might not be as easy for us, but we can still accomplish anything that anyone else does. Go to therapy, work out, eat healthy, meditate, pray, do whatever you can to help. You got this. ❤️"
Anxiety,I forgot how damn soothing Minecraft is. First time I felt this calm in like 3 years,I recommend playing Minecraft with the sound up because the music in the background is really nice. Oh and turn on creative mode. I think I might try using Minecraft again to help me not be constantly worrying about my future or feeling guilty about everything. I recommend you at least try it if you can.
Anxiety,"Frustrated, need to vent a little","So, to make this short, I've been battling with (almost) crippling health anxiety for over 4 years now. I got diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2016, got treated (surgery was enough, so no chemo nor radiation) and been a complete wreck after that. For some reason, I'm constantly fearing my heart will just stop. I think a fear of cancer would make a little more sense in my position, but oh well. I'm 38 now and know full well, that every year my chances of getting sometimes serious only rises.

I often wake up in the middle of the night feeling I'm about to die. Like seriously. It's a weird ass feeling. Sometimes I scream as I wake up. I don't think there's an hour in the day when I'm not thinking about death. If I feel just a slight discomfort in my body, it's cancer, blood cot, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, etc. You name it and I've been certain that I've had it in one point. Since I have heartburn/acid reflux/chest pains quite often, it's usually the heart attack. Sometimes I think I'm not getting enough oxygen or that there's something in my throat blocking the airways or something.

Of course I've had my share of full blown panic attacks too, but for whatever reason there hasn't been one in a couple of years. It's just the constant lingering feeling of doom that really takes it toll on me. Life is not particularly enjoyable like this and to add insult to injury, I've had to let go of things like coffee and many foods since all this began. I can't enjoy the little things in life, since they seem to worsen my anxiety.

Yesterday I just chilled, went for a long brisk walk, had a sauna session and had sex with my wife. Terrible, right? Of course after all that I had the worst night in a while and feeling super anxious for at least today, quite possibly the next few days.

Anxiety, or whatever the hell I have, just sucks man."
Anxiety,Meds against anxiety,"Hey the schools in germany open in 2 weeks and my  17 year old hardly depressed ass gets a anxiety attack even thinking about going to school again and interact with the teachers or students.

My suicide date is in April 2022 and I dont think I can even survive that long without serious Meds.

Anxiety,The combination of mental illness and education,"The combination of mental illness and education is really not it. Before the christmas break I was not doing well and I was waiting until the break to catch up to my assigments. I thought everything would go smoothly, because now I had two weeks to do everything I hadn't yet finished before.
Then boom. Mental illness. That piss face really messes everything up. Now I have just 1 day to complete the assignments, and I had to select the most critical ones, which means that I'm behind on school work AGAIN. Man I'm tired. I don't know how I'm gonna graduate lol because I have my exams this year and so far it has not been going well. :')
If this keeps up it won't end well either. 
And for some reason everytime I need to start an assignment I get scared? And I must admit that I'm lazy too, but there's this other feeling, greater than laziness, that just holds me back or something? Everytime I think about school or look at the books on my desk I get scared or something. And this really doesn't mix well with trying to get motivation to do the assigments. So yea, do y'all have any takes on this? I would love to hear your experiences and possibly some tips you have."
Anxiety,Ok,Do anyone have physical symptoms of anxiety like Twitching in the thumb by the pulse or like numb or tingling different parts of the body or anything because i do and its not from my meds or i know i am healthy because i went the ER recently last year in the spam of 3 months of 5 or 6 time's because i keep having heart palpitations and i feel like i was dying at that time i feel like i was going crazy but right now I am recovering from anxiety slowly and I'm having some bumps in the road from my recovery and i know some coping skills works for other people and not for the same thing's will work for other people but what can i do to help to cope with anxiety.  Please and thank you
Anxiety,Has anyone successfully treated childhood onset anxiety? What worked for you?,"My anxiety goes back as long as I can remember. When I was 27 and learned the symptoms of anxiety, I realized that I had been having anxiety all my life. Having the nurse dismiss my complaints of “my heart hurting.” The outbursts that ostracized me from classmates and made teachers hate me. The trips to the principals office, the calls home, the school telling my mom that she needed to take me to a doctor. My mom took me out of school for the day for the “doctor’s appt” but her telling me that I’m fine and didn’t need to go. I have no idea if there was ever an appt.

My anxiety has never really been treated. I’m super aversive to meds; partly ingrained stigma, anxiety about meds, and a genuine belief that other treatments are more effective and less harmful (CBD, diet, exercise). There’s also the fact that I think I’m autistic. I’ve always thought I was different and when my kids had sensory issues, rigidity, language and social delays, I wasn’t concerned because I was and still am the exact same way.

I’ve started buspirone and I’m spiraling. None of my usual methods are helping calm my anxiety. I’m constantly on the verge of tears and can’t sleep. I feel like my anxiety is near constant. I’m trying the apps, the journaling, etc. There’s no relief and no sleep. I thought about driving myself to the hospital. I’ve called the mental health line twice today (a complete joke, they kicked me off the phone at the 30 min mark).

At this point, I’m wondering if there’s a difference in treating adult onset vs childhood onset anxiety. Or am I just irretrievably broken and that’s why nothing is helping. I just want to fix myself and see what life is like without anxiety.

And...now I’m crying again. Sitting in the car at 4 am so I don’t wake anyone."
Anxiety,Manual breathing and swallowing - can’t sleep at all. Please help!,"23M. Ever since 2 days ago I’ve started manually noticing my swallowing. I have to swallow my saliva every few seconds. Also, less frequently, This goes on throughout the day. 

When I lay in bed, ever since 2 days ago, I have to manually breathe in and out. It felt like my automatic breathing and swallowing stopped. In addition, whenever I feel there is a buildup of saliva in my mouth when laying in bed, I have to swallow it. It is absolutely awful. Because of my manual breathing and swallowing, I cannot fall asleep. I’ve spent 2 nights, going to bed at 11 PM and just laying there for 8 hours until the morning without ever falling asleep once because of the manual breathing the need to and swallow my saliva in bed. I have not fallen asleep in 2 days because of this. And I’m super sleep deprived. 

How do I stop manually swallowing my saliva and manually breathing when I’m trying to sleep? This is absolutely awful. I’ve never had to just lay in bed because of manual swallowing and breathing for the entire night without being able to sleep. I just want to be able to sleep again, especially because I have work.

Anxiety,Superstitious fear of writing out words,"Hi guys,

I'm not sure that this is an OCD trait or not which is why I am posting here. For reference: I have GAD and have just started Zoloft.

One of my weird idiosyncrasies (which thankfully nobody knows about!) is that I will avoid typing out certain words.

For instance: I'm currently creating a Google Drive folder in which I plan on adding a bunch of mental health resources.

So I'm creating my subfolders 'Anxiety,' 'ADHD,' 'OCD,' — but then when it comes to depression I can't quite bring myself to write it out. So instead I create a folder called 'Dep' which will be my secret shorthand.

Why do I do this? I have no idea! It's like to avoid giving power to something I'm scared of or ashamed about I guess. I do the same thing about the current virus engulfing the world, even in conversation. I call it ""the pandemic.""

Anybody have something simillar?"
Anxiety,I don’t know what’s wrong,"I have depression and anxiety but I recently “graduated” therapy. I was in therapy for a year and a half and we agreed that all my goals had been accomplished so we terminated. It felt amazing. Then the very next day I had a massive panic attack. I talked to some peers and called it up to the fear of not having my therapist to talk to anymore. I’ve become very aware and sensitive to the sounds around me, specifically any sounds emanating from my dogs mouths. It is as though the sounds good to the core and makes me want to throw up. I have never really noticed it before except the slight irritation of the sounds of licking. More sounds have been bugging me and I don’t know what is going on. My sleep is also being affected. Does anyone have similar experiences?"
Anxiety,Why buspirone gets me apathy?,"and how can i get it apathy, cuz i have tons of work and i can't work without better mood"
Anxiety,Anybody else ride the caffeine / alcohol train prior to starting medication?,"I'm currently writing up some notes for my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow.

One of the issues that drew me to treatment was the fact that I needed to greatly cut back on the amount of alcohol I was drinking. And, in fact, to cut it down to a bear minimum. I was diagnosed with gastritis after a surgery a year ago (unrelated to alcohol!) and, to keep it in remission, I don't have much leeway. 

The problem was that I was drinking copious amounts of coffee by day in order to summon up the motivation to work. And in order to stay focused on the task(s) at hand. 

I'm sorry to say that I was stuck on the caffeine:alcohol seesaw for many years. By day, I would drink about 5 to 6 cups of coffee depending on my workload. By night I would have a beer or two in order to come down from the physical anxiety that the coffee produced and get to sleep. My alcohol consumption was never crazy but ... it became clear that even 1-2 beers a few nights a week was too much for my gastritis.

After several attempts, I concluded that there was no way that I was going to be able to figure this out on my own. If I cut out coffee, I simply couldn't focus on anything or get anything done (which in turn made me stressed out and anxious). If I cut out the alcohol, I would have severe insomnia and anxiety. There was nothing to dampen it down.

At one stage I even looked into taking up weed to replace the alcohol. But I hate weed and have bronchitis. And my lungs couldn't even handle vaping!

This madness persisted for 5 years or so. Until my surgery it sort of worked. But obviously this crazy self medication duo was unsustainable from the get-go.

I'm now trying to figure out what's causing what. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD but my ADHD doc now things I have primary anxiety and secondary focus issues. Or possibly both. But he wants me to treat the anxiety before resuming treatment.

Sharing this in case anybody else has been on the same self-medication ""combo."" I reckon it has to be relatively common.  If you were on it and managed to get off thanks to proper treatment, please share what worked for you."
Anxiety,Intense anxiety first thing in the morning,"I have had anxiety for years but it became super intense after I had my daughter 4 years ago.  A lot of nights, I have what I call ""anxiety dreams"" which is basically a panic attack in dream form, a bunch of situations that make me anxious just playing out in my head all night. When I wake up in the morning, I feel so much anxiety that my chest has a lot of pressure on it and it makes me uncomfortable. I can't stop thinking about everything I have to do even if it's menial shit, like going to pick up my daughter or cleaning or something. Stuff that shouldn't make me anxious.

Even when I am not particularly worried about anything, I can feel like there are bricks loaded up on my shoulders. I am interested in all tips, pharmaceutical and non.

It has all been too much lately and the anxiety was taking over every single moment of my days.  Now, I can breathe.

Anybody else experience realizations of how bad your anxiety truly ~~was~~ is after finding something that helps? I didn't realize how I hold myself and my body so tightly and rigidly until the medication calmed my nerves.  I hadn't realized how much of my day is truly consumed with anxious thoughts.  Without this medication I would not have realized I am constantly scanning my surroundings for threats, and by doing so I am missing out on what is in front of me.  I am so thankful for these couple days of peace and being.  Here's hoping it keeps doing its job."
Anxiety,I hate my anxiety,I have always had really bad social anxiety that makes it difficult to open up to new people but when I do start to get comfortable being around them I for some reason can’t seem to shut up and end up saying something that causes them to not want to be around me as much.

Anxiety,So many bad things happening at once?,"Hey guys,

(27)F: Last year has been horrible and I know everyone can pretty much relate. But for some reason so many bad things have happened that it truly took a toll on my mental health. I’ve been going to therapy once a month but it hasn’t helped as much. Does it make sense for so many things to go wrong? Why does this happen? Here are the three things that has just truly taking a toll on me:

1. My one and only best friend has done a complete 180 on me. We have been friends for 15 years and ever since she had a baby she just changed directly towards me. She hasn’t done this with anyone else. Anytime I come over she acts like she doesn’t want me there, doesn’t text me as much anymore, talks behind my back constantly, and makes other people against me. I have a child also and never acted different towards her or made her feel like shit. I understand people are different after kids, but it’s only towards me and feels like I’m always singled out. Whenever I come over she’ll try to tell my kid to share or get off a couch and say she’s off the hook. Mind you she’s never said these things to her before and tries to now act like a better parent. I don’t feel comfortable with her saying things like that to my child. I don’t know why she’s being standoffish and I’ve mentioned to it to her before and it only made things worse.

2. My job. I started working at a high stress level and burnout known position. I didn’t know before taking the job it was like this. I lasted a year until recently I put in my two weeks but thankfully only because I had another job lined up. I would blame myself for not excelling at the job.

3. My family. My younger sister has been trying to win herself back into the family and moved back into my moms, after leaving for a few years with her boyfriend. She’ll constantly buy things for my parents and try to impress them. She’s gotten as far as now my mom let’s her smoke weed and drink in the house. Every time I come over it smells like a trap house now. As the oldest of four, I’m usually the one my family looks up to and if they need any guidance I’m always there. I try to be the responsible one and everyone just looks at me now like the prude or buzz kill. Is it wrong for me to want to lead my other two siblings in the right direction with college and not just smoking weed all the time? My house was never like this growing up but I feel like my mom has just given up... 

I always blame myself for everything. I try to look at every situation like what am I doing wrong and how can I fix it. Why are so many bad things happening at once? What can I do to improve my situation? Help, I’m truly dying mentally."

Anxiety,Anxiety changes as I've aged / recently flare-up of contamination/dirt anxiety - can anyone else relate?,"CW for dirt/contamination anxiety


*This is a long post, just fyi. Thank you for reading.*


Hi - I recently found this community and it's been so comforting to read about others' experiences and feel less alone. I hope my background and questions can do the same for y'all. 

At around 8 or 9 years old, I was diagnosed with clinical depression, panic disorder, Tourette's, and I think, but am not sure, mild OCD (my memory isn't clear on whether this was a diagnosis in itself or if it was just discussed as part of my anxiety). I was on various meds until my early 20s when I went cold turkey - not the best idea, but thankfully it worked out. I've been high functioning most of my life with only a few really bad bouts of anxiety/depression that hindered my day-to-day activities. I grew out of the Tourette's. 

The way my anxiety manifests seems to change over time - as a kid, major panic attacks that appeared out if the blue prompted my diagnoses. Meds helped those acute symptoms and as I got older, a lot of it seemed to just fade to the background- I don't remember having major anxiety or depression issues through high school. I had a brief bit of depression feelings (how I describe feeling depression creep in before I'm debilitated) right before starting college, which is how I learned that any life change, even good ones, can trigger anxiety/depression. But I bounced back quickly and again, don't recall having major anxiety or depression issues until my early twenties. Granted, a lot of rough stuff happened in that interim, but I only recall ""normal"" stress feelings rather than what I've learned to recognize as anxiety/depression, if that makes sense. 

From my early twenties to now, which would be about a decade, it seems like I've constantly had to deal with anxiety, specifically, manifesting in a myriad of ways - social anxiety, health/body anxiety, dating/relationship anxiety, full-blown panic attacks complete with feeling of doom (that was fun to have happen out of nowhere, for the first time since childhood, about two years ago, let me tell you). All in varying degrees of intensity, all ebbing and flowing. Now logically I know I've had lots of good stretches too, and I've done a lot of work on myself to deal with deeper issues and cut a lot of stress from my life. That's not the cure, but it helped, and knowing myself and learning my own emotional patterns has given me more of a feeling of control over my anxiety and my life.

But being in the middle of a days-long anxiety episode sucks balls, and none of that reflection or knowledge seems to help. I'm 32 and am genuinely happy with my life, but feel like a total failure that I'm still having anxiety episodes. I worry that my partner will get fed up and leave (he's not that kind of person at all, but anxiety-brain says ""this is all he sees about you, this ridiculous anxiety""). 

So my first question is: has anyone else seen their anxiety change over time? How do you deal with it? Do you constantly feel blindsided, or do you feel you manage new manifestations/surprise attacks pretty well?

My next question is about what triggered my current anxiety episode. I feel ridiculous even typing this, but I know there has to be someone out there who relates.

Our cat has fleas - not a bad infestation, nothing to logically get worked up about, but I had never dealt with this before, so it's new and that alone is enough to make me tense. Plus it's a disruption to my home, which is my safe place, anxiety-wise. But my partner was very supportive and helped with treating the house, etc, so I felt okay. He used diatomaceous earth on our upstairs carpet (where the cat spends most of her time) and vacuumed it up while I was at work one day. Cool. I registered a bit of extra dust on bookshelves but nothing that triggered anxiety any further. So I DE the downstairs, where our bedroom is, a few days later. Slept on the couch for a night then went to vacuum. Can you say dust bomb? Y'all, I just didn't know. We have a cheap but usually effective regular vacuum that blows air out the back. Suffice it to say there was DE everywhere downstairs and I felt like it followed me upstairs. Immediate panic. I googled way too much and my health anxiety went NUTS. I started on a cleaning spree but nothing seemed to help, just moved the dirt around. So at this point, I feel like I can't sit or stand or touch anything in my home without coming away dirty. I was able to borrow a shop vac from a friend which helped so much, and I got an air purifier which helped practically and for my mental state. I was also fighting anxiety paralysis and exhaustion from not sleeping well - I couldn't bring myself to sleep in my bed for five nights. Finally my partner snapped about not being able to sleep in the bed (bedding was at shop vac friend's house being washed bc our washer also kicked it during all this) and that was my moment of clarity, as I tend to have at the peak of an anxiety attack - ""ohhh, this is a full blown Anxiety Attack with some OCD on the side. Great."" 

The clear realization of what my brain was doing helped start the comedown, and I was able to get the bedroom to a point where I could sleep there (although not totally anxiety-free). I cleaned a bit more of the house (also trying to declutter at the same time because it's a small house and all this had me feeling the need to chunk everything), then gave myself permission to just stop cleaning for a couple days and get tf outside, even if it was just to go sit in my car and read. That helped a tad more, but though calmer on the outside, I was still a miserable mess inside. My world, my home, still felt (still feels) totally ransacked. I've also had a long holiday break off work so I've had no daily structure. The anxiety has made it impossible to do hobbies and things I'd normally do on time off work. I ended up going to stay with my best friend who knows what's going on and is incredibly supportive. I'm doing some backed up laundry here and trying to use the change of environment to chill the hell out so I can go home and function normally again, so I can feel safe and comfortable in my home again and not like everything I touch is dirty.

To clarify, normal dust and stuff from living in a house doesn't bother me. I'm a tidy person, but this level of panic surprised even me.

I feel like a failure for being sent into such a tailspin over dirt. I know it will get better and I'll feel better gradually, but in the midst of it, it feels like I'll be anxious and afraid forever.

Anxiety,How hard do you guys/girls disassociate?,"I feel like disassociation has been a big issue for me when it comes to anxiety. Honestly, I can't tell which is worse - feeling traditional anxiety or feeling this sense of potent disassociation. 


Today it hit me like a ton of bricks out of nowhere. I was actually having a good day! I felt relatively fine, at least compared to how I usually feel. Then I just felt the disassociation come on strong... I felt out of place, a bit lightheaded, dizzy, almost out of body, out of it, etc.


I know it is a symptom of anxiety, but it is just so uncomfortable,  especially at work where I have to stand, talk, and write for a portion of the day."

Anxiety,How to deal with my health anxiety ?,"I can feel several lymph nodes in my neck and not sick: is that normal ?


Hello everyone. First time posting here. I am 18. My health anxiety has reached a peak. I have two lymph nodes that I can feel, one on each side of my jaw. It’s been a while I can feel them though and thought it was normal until I googled it and realised it wasn’t. I always have a high temperature (37.5/37.7 rectally) and wondered if it was normal. Since I now have a new one, it freaked me out. Blood test 2 weeks ago showed no infection and the fear is literally paralising me. I live in a rural area and my parents will not take me to the doctor, telling me that I am crazy. A few days ago I was sneezing etc, maybe I got a cold which explains the new ones but I somehow don’t believe it because I got a blood test that showed no infection. I am so scared, I don’t want to die. The 2 on each side are around the size of an Olive (between a pea and an olive). I should have never looked on google in the first place but now I need help to get over it. 
I need help. I can’t help but think it’s too late. My blood test came back clean so no infection. Dr Google convinced me that lymphoma is the only other explanation.

I started touching my neck everywhere and found 2 symmetrical hard things that are probably muscles but a bit round so I freaked. I started palpating everywhere and get convinced it’s a lymph node all the time. I am mentally exhausted, I need help on how to manage the anxiety. My psychologist is returning on the 12th only but I can’t take it until that. Please help. In away, or advice."

Anxiety,Can't think things through when asked a question over the phone or in person.,"I noticed that if I'm asked a question, (if I'm making an appointment, or if someone asks me for a favor), I usually tend to agree or give a positive answer. But after a while, if I have time to think a little, I regret my decision... 

And usually, when people ask me for a favor, it's like I panic on the inside, or have brain fog. I just can't seem to think fast on my feet and give a thoughtful reply and usually have second thoughts afterward. It's weird, but I don't have the same problem at all if it's in writing (over email, texts, social media, etc)

Does this happen to you too? If so, how have you come to get over this problem? I'm almost sure it's related to my anxiety, like many other things :)"
Anxiety,Anxiety with sleep,"Happy New Year.

I’m a long time sufferer of generalized anxiety disorder, which seems to come out in new ways more and more. Lately, I’ve been developing these two very specific and very scary habits of 

1. Holding my breath, and then feeling dread because I know one day that I will die (I always end up saying these words “I’m gonna die soon”) which causes a panic attack. I’ve been doing this more and more lately (it started after my little brothers death 2 years ago) and I can’t catch myself doing it proactively to stop it.

2. I am developing a fear of falling asleep. Laying in bed and closing my eyes makes me feel claustrophobic. I feel fear about sleep itself.

These two things don’t happen every night but they happen often enough now to cause some pause in me. Right now, I’m not taking any medication and won’t be able to see a psychiatrist until a few weeks from now. Anxiety is a main player in my life and our current climate is sending me into new avenues of fear.

Anyone else deal with similar issues as above and can recommend some ways to help me? 

Thank you."
Anxiety,Help,Anyone else ever felt speedy ? Like right now it feels like I’ve drank 10 cups of coffee. I feel lots of energy or hyper. It’s super weird. Kinda making me panic quite a bit. Is this normal? My heart isn’t racing fast or getting any other physical symptoms I just feel like I’ve had loads of caffeine
Anxiety,Using Power Tools Outside of My Apartment,"Warning: This post is gonna be a little long, and if some parts don't make sense, I'm sorry haha. I did smoke a bit of weed to relax 😂

Hi all,

I live in a 4-apartment building, (can't really call it a complex lol), with two on the bottom story, and two right above each, and a driveway that goes up a hill around to the back. I guess that part's kind of unnecessary, but I wanted to kind of set the scene of my neighborhood haha. There's houses to my right in my left, no other apartments around. The house to my right is owned by a hoarder, and she has trash piled up on her yard, in her driveway, etc because her house can't be lived in so she lives in her car. The house to my left is owned by a guy who uses power tools somewhat often when he's working on his car, which of course I don't have a problem with.

I planned on repainting the hood of my car, and I bought an orbital sander to sand off the old paint. When I turned it on, it's kinda loud. I know my neighbors are off course farther away, and only planned to use it between the hours of about 1 PM to 5 PM (I know the neighbor above me pretty well, he gets up kinda late sometimes, and the other neighbors next to him might be getting kicked out anyways). But regardless of all that, I hate bringing any attention to myself. It just fills me with anxiety, no matter how much know I'm trying to not frustrate or disturb the people around me. Part of that is probably because I'm trans, but that's a whole other can of worms.

I plan on getting rid of the car soon, so it's not that important to me if I even do it, but the paint just looks horrible to me and I'll enjoy doing it. I know the logical thing is to just do it, because anyone that might be disturbed would most likely tell me, and that would be that. Life would go on. The neighbor wouldn't hold a grudge about that, and I would be perfectly fine. But my brain isn't satisfied with that.."
Anxiety,20 M adult struggling with separation anxiety with father figure.,"I’m gonna try to be concise, but I think some context is necessary to explain my situation. 

I grew up in a two-parent household, and although my dad was physically present, he was absent in every other way. He never showed any interest in my life, never showed me any type of affection (i’ve never hugged or exchanged “i love you” with my dad ever) and he became downright abusive once I found out he was cheating on my mom w/prostitutes and a family friend I had talked to about it told my mom. I was really depressed and suicidal in high school and my biological dad just made things worse. 

Fast forward to now, I go to college in a different state but am back home because or covid. My dad and I don’t talk at all and haven’t really spoken to each other in a few years despite living in the same house. 

When I graduated high school, I became close to an older family friend (he’s in his late 40’s) who’s been more of a father to me than my dad ever has. He’s definitely filled that void in my life and I don’t think I’d be alive if it weren’t for his involvement in my life. 

We’re still really close and hangout somewhat regularly, but in the past few months (especially with being home and not on campus), I’ve been feeling this intense sadness and grief when my family friend isn’t around. I know I have no reason to be insecure about our relationship, he’s assured me multiple times that he intends to be a part of my life forever. I also recognize that I’m probably too old to be needing a father figure in the capacity that I feel like I do. I’m just unable to come to terms with the reality that I can’t “redo” my childhood with this family friend as my dad, and that idea of what my life “could’ve been” if this family friend was my real dad torments me and keeps me up at night. Every night before I sleep I fantasize about what my life would be like if this family friend was my real dad. 

I know I have to be my own man and grow up and be independent and all that, but a future without this family friend being the center of my life seems bleak and fucked up to me. I want to maintain my relationship with him but I also want to feel more okay with him not being around. Any advice would be deeply appreciated (I already see a therapist)."
Anxiety,"Can't find the motivation for things I enjoy, so how do I find motivation for work?","I don't know how else to explain it. I've said it to people around me before and I don't want to say it again to I've come here. I don't want to be here. I don't enjoy much, and I have to work in order for anything I've got going for me currently to work. I have zero energy to get out there and try to get a job, because it'll just be minimum wage, me working my ass off, and me starting to have panic attacks again because that's what happens when I'm working. I can find some level of normalcy until I add a huge stressor like work into the mix. 

On top of feeling no will to work, I know this is a shitty quality and hate myself for it, and I want to know what I could change to feel better and start living a better life. this shit's so hard"
Anxiety,How to get over the fear?,"How do I get over the fear of Schizophrenia? I have had this fear for 5 months and it has absolutely ruined my life. It’s the sole cause of my anxiety, if this fear goes away, so does my anxiety. Please help. I have a small history, my aunt has the illness. According to my father, from over 10,000 individuals in our family (I’m Arab), there have only been 3 cases, and none of them from my generation. Please help me get over this fear. My psychiatrists treat me like shit and don’t bother with this fear."

Anxiety,Scared of burdening my partner with my mental health issues but I don't know where to start with getting professional help,"I think I need someone to talk to about my previous toxic (and somewhat abusive relationship), attachment issues and general anxiety about things. My partner has been amazing with me but I am concerned that if he is the only person I talk to about my issues it will later become a burden on him. 

I have only had bad experiences with the GP and therapy (I tried counselling and cbt with the uni mental health service). The doctor diagnosed me with depression after an under 10 minute session and prescribed me with antidepressants (citalopram) and didn't listen to me or give me a proper assessment or anything. I don't think I have depression or if I did at the time it was alongside something else but either way he didn't couldn't have assessed that properly. 

I want a psychological assessment to see what is wrong with me, or at least a therapist who will be able to give me decent advice. I'm just so tired and done with this because every time I put effort into getting help it just makes things worse and therapy here is like £40 a session which I can't really afford since I can just about afford to pay for food and rent. 
I would try to find a way to get the money if I thought therapy would actually help, like maybe work night shift as well as uni or something (I do engineering so the course is really full on) but since I doubt I will be able to open up to them anyway without a very large number of sessions I am just scared to try in case it fails again.

Sorry for the rant guys I'm just really exhausted with this"

Anxiety,How does one deal with anxiety with COVID?,"I recently caught COVID and even though my symptoms are fairly easy (fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of taste and smell, nausea, minor headache, *shortness of breath*), I couldn’t handle the anxiety. Mind you, I was going through extreme anxiety before I caught covid, but now that I’m infected I can no longer see a therapist (I can’t do online therapy), I need to stop the antidepressant that I have just started because it may exasperate the symptoms, and the pills my psychiatrist prescribed (Rivotril 0.5ml) aren’t ideal (they make me very sleepy + their effect isn’t that strong on calming me).

So, what you doing to tackle the anxiety? I can’t sleep because of it and when I do I wake up really early (after almost 2 hours of sleep only)."
Anxiety,Wife Left 6 weeks Ago And I Wake Up With Anxiety/Panic,"She left me 6 weeks ago. Said she would be back in 3 weeks in time for our marriage counseling appointment.  When it came time for that she thought she had Covid-19 then didn't want to come home to get me sick. She tested negative but still didn't want to come home. Marriage counseling has been slow because of the holidays. And we have another appointment after 2 weeks in a few days. I have journaled, read everything i read, soul searched found inspiration etc. 

It's now to the point where my mom doesn't want to talk about it anymore. I can't bother my friend's. I have no one who wants to even listen. 

We are able to talk one the phone sometimes with my wife. But I'm no longer any sort of priority. She acts as I'm some distant friend. She is living with friends who I've never met, I have no clue where she is and she barely tells me anything. I tell her I love her and miss her. I get ""I know you do"". 

My anxiety is thru the roof. I have a Dr appointment tomorrow for anxiety meds because I just can't handle it anymore. I cry everyday because I miss her, I cry because everyone else is more important than me, I cry everyday because she says that our apartment never felt like her home. When I tried so hard to make it both of ours.

I just don't know what to do anymore. She tells me to ""work and focus on me"". Which I have everyday for weeks.  I'm terrified of this ending."

Anxiety,Earthquakes...,"Just as I thought covid was giving me constant anxiety, I’ve experienced my first ever earthquake 6 months ago (althought I live in a seismically very active area) and many more since then. What I can say for sure is that I would take 10 more years of this pandemic over the unknowingness that comes with earthquakes. I’m sick of going to bed in terror not knowing what will happen or of the everlasting fear that I fear no matter when and where I am because I know for a fact that another earthquake could happen at any point in time. I know this fear won’t change anything but I simply cannot stop thinking about it and I feel that my life has now forever changed and that it will be accompanied by anxiety forever."
Anxiety,Seeking for help!,"People always see me smiling but what they don't know see is the struggle that goes on in my head. I'm always thinking a thousand things at once. So much that I get overwhelmed and my mind goes blank and I walk around trying to think of things I needed or wanted to do. It frustrates me to no end!
 
When I get to thinking of all the stuff I want to do and need to do, it exhausts me and I actually don't have the energy to do it. A lot of times all I wanna do is curl up into a ball and cry hoping that I could actually stop thinking so much. 

When my mind goes blank, it gives me so much anxiety, because I feel like I'm missing something &amp; not good enough and it completely terrifies me! Somedays, it just gets to be to much and I don't know how to handle it. People say that talking helps but how could it help if you have no idea how to describe your feeling ??"
Anxiety,Why being “uptight” is negative?,"I’m almost 20 yrs old and I’ve realized people would consider me “uptight”. I’m a perfectionist and I like doing things a certain way. I also feel like I know myself very well at this point. I know if I stay up too late I’ll feel awful, I can’t stand the taste of alcohol, I try not to eat unhealthily because I know it makes me feel bad. It seems like people who are uptight are always encouraged to “loosen up” and a “go-with-the-flow” personality is the ideal. Even though I am anxious when meeting new people I do my best not to let it limit me or prevent me from trying things out of my comfort zone, but I think being “uptight” is just part of who I am. And why is it such a negative thing? I don’t let my anxiety limit me and I like to challenge it, but I will be nervous and tense in new situations and I always have been. Why can’t I be who I am, why do I have to change myself so drastically or why am I expected to do that when a “down-to-earth” type is never expected to be more “uptight”? Imo I see a lot of these “chill” types tend to get in more trouble and take a lot longer to figure out what works for them than people who are “uptight”. What do you all think? Shouldn’t I just be who I am or do I really need to change myself drastically to get other people to like me - even though that would be dishonest? Anyone else who is “uptight” and still managed to find a life partner or great friends who accepted you for who you are?"
Anxiety,Can’t Sleep Because of Scary Thoughts,"The other night, my cousins and I talked about creepy experiences and now I can’t sleep because I’m too afraid. My brain wouldn’t shut up and i’m shaking right now. Pls help"
Anxiety,Anxiety hitting hard these days. Don't know what to do.,"So, this is my 1st post here because I want a little bit of help... I (25M) have been living always in the same city, where I have my friends, my girlfriend and my parents. I have never been alone, in other words. 4 months ago I was promoted on my job (a little promotion) but I had to move 100km away because the position was in another place. I obviously agreed and moved where I am living now. Firstly, I had a shared flat with two flatmates and everything was fine, but I saw an opportunity of a flat that I was able to pay and I could live alone. I took it and everything has improved: I'm alone, I can watch anything I want on the TV, I can listen to music as high as I can, well the perks of being alone and not sharing a flat.

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other side, the ""wrong"" part of this is my job: whenever I do a wrong thing, my boss used to tell me that wrong things in a good way, so I could learn and not repeat it again (I've been on this position for 3 months now), but the last month or so he tells me those things in a worse way, so I feel quite bad. It's a very dynamic job, and one works more than 8h a day (that is a normal thing), usually 9 or so. Then, it gets dark here very early (5pm), and if you add that I am alone here, sometimes it get very depressing. I meditate, workout at the gym and try to be creative at the kitchen. I also do FaceTime with my girlfriend and try to watch shows. I try also to stick to routines (preparing the clothes the day before for example). 

&amp;#x200B;

But I've come to the conclusion that my main anxiety causes are:

\- **My boss' ways of telling me things**: I worry a lot about if I made any mistake that he can realize next day we work. I obviously try to make everything as better as I can but I worry a lot whether or not I commit any mistake

\- **The location of my job:** Our main office is 5 minutes away from home. That is ok. But we opened a second office 40 minutes away from here and every two weeks I have to be there. The office is located in an industrial area, there's almost no people nearby and when I'm there, on the evenings I get a little depressed (it's cold, dark and I am 45 minutes away from home)

\- **Being alone and the fact that it gets dark very soon**

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for reading all of this and I hope you all are as good as possible!"
Anxiety,Palpitations / Feeling heartbeat for over 24 hours,"I've had anxiety and depression for most of my life, pretty well controlled (therapy). Last night I felt my heart start pounding in my chest, I've had it come and go before and thought I was just getting a bit anxious but I didn't feel any different emotionally/mentally. After an hour it hadn't gone away so I did some breathing exercises, meditation and took some Bach Rescue Pastilles, and all throughout I felt completely calm, but it didn't stop the feeling of my heart beating so strongly. 

It took a while to get to sleep and I woke up two hours later with the feeling still there. At this point I was starting to get anxious as I couldn't get rid of it and was worried there was something wrong, i.e a heart problem. I did everything to try and distract from it, watching Youtube, playing word games on my phone, having white noise on, but it just never went away. 

I woke up in the morning and it was still there, accompanied by slight tightening of my chest and small stabbing pains. I called 111 who advised A&amp;E to do some tests. As soon as I started moving about I started to feel quite dizzy / lightheaded, but this could easily have been my anxiety acting up with going through it all. I went to A&amp;E and had an ECG and my blood pressure checked, both came back normal. I was supposed to get a blood test done to check my thyroid but this wasn't done, for some reason. I saw the doctor and he was... less than reassuring. 

He said judging by my ECG I was medically fine and he was happy to discharge me, he told me that I shouldn't go on any medication for my anxiety as ""it'll turn me into a drug addict"", and I just needed more ""me time"". I left feeling horrible, and now back at home, I can still feel my heart beating quite prominently in my chest, along with some slight pain. It does kind of go away if I can properly distract myself, but other than that there's nothing I can really do except wait. It's been nearly 24 hours at this point and I'm desperate for the feeling to stop, I've never had it go on for so long before. 

Has anyone else experienced it for so long? I'm desperate for it to end."
Anxiety,HeadPain in fitness,"So I’m not generally an anxious guy but when it comes to my physical health I certainly am.

Over the last week I’ve been experiencing pressure behind my eye in my ears and nose aswell as a sore neck (all on the right side) when I’m lifting in my home gym, it’s really been throwing me off and I am unable to contact my gp until Tuesday, anyone experience anything similar to this at all or have any idea of a cause?"
Anxiety,Paranoia,"After having two separate conversations with my sister, and my friends I’ve just now realized that it’s not normal to think that there are people watching you through cameras in your home. I have never been on anxiety medication for long because it makes me feel so dull and I just deal with my anxious moments as they come, but the paranoia is such a constant in my life that it never occurred to me that it’s not normal. 

I don’t know what to do with myself now that I know this is abnormal. Back to the meds that make me miserable, get therapy, or just live in my normal. It doesn’t cause me to want to harm myself or others but I definitely have moments where I get embarrassed just being home alone and doing normal things because the “camera people” might see me doing something weird. It’s like social anxiety has followed me into my own home. Anybody else relate? Any suggestions?"
Anxiety,Anxiety about eating,"I don't know why, I've always had such a good appetite. Always loved trying different food but they last few weeks, I have bad anxiety when I go to eat. I just have no appetite. I sometimes feel hungry but when I try to eat, it just makes me gag. I hate this, it's making me feel so weak 😪"
Anxiety,"I have such a small problem, but it's causing such intense anxiety","Basically, I don't have many people on my contact list on my phone. When I don't speak to people for a while I delete their phone number because it's just going to be taking up room.

Well, I got a text from someone, who knows my nickname so I know I know them, but I don't know who they are. They also said ""Happy new year, I miss you"" so it feels like an old friend. I just responded with two cheesy emojis because I didn't want to be like ""who dis?"" But then they wanted to chat so I said ""sure"" and I don't recognize the voice but it sounded so generic that it could be anyone of my old buddies. They also have the same area code as my city so... 

Anyway, I hung up right after asking how they are and it was like ""not too good"" or something and now I feel guilty as hell! But I'm too anxious and I feel like I'm too far in to say: ""sorry, who dis?""

I'm such a dumbass. So I turned off my phone and don't know what to do. I'm too much of a coward to fess up that I don't know who they are. But I feel guilty because they aren't doing too well.

I've also eliminated so many people on who it is that I just don't have a clue."
Anxiety,I’m really anxious about life going back to normal,"Anyone have any idea when that’s going to be here in the United States? When we can safely have parties, gatherings, and special events again (even with a vaccine?) I’m an introvert and a homebody, with some social anxiety. I really hated having to go to all these dinner parties before the pandemic started. The environment and people are really superficial talking about what everyone is doing in life, accomplishments, fancy titles/pedigrees, etc. I’ve been struggling a lot and life hasn’t met my expectations. I feel super bad that people have died and suffered from this pandemic, but honestly, I was really hoping the social distancing would last another year or two. It’s been nice for me and even my mental health (I know many people don’t see it that way, and I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend anyone with this post)."
Anxiety,I vomit when I am yelled at. How can I change this?,"I (F23) dry heave and often vomit when somebody is yelling at me and despite medication and persistent therapy, I can’t seem to get a grip on this. Part of the issue is that I prefer to vomit in these situations because it gives my numbing hands and feet relief during an anxiety attack. 

I have a minimal social life and do not interact with people who typically raise their voice as I find it too overwhelming. However as expected in anybody’s life, I do have situations here and there where I am yelled at in an argument whether it be by my father or my boyfriend and I need tips on how to not vomit when it happens. 

Ultimately I fear that when/if I have children, I will not be able to physically tolerate their yelling. 

I no longer am in contact with my mother because of the lasting effects of her abuse in my childhood. By 10 years old she yelled at me about her money issues every morning on the way to school, by junior high I opted to walk because her yelling often induced my vomiting. It is abundantly obvious that my issue with vomiting in response to being yelled at was breaded by my mother’s abuse. The first time I had ever thrown up from someone yelling was in her car when she told me that if I want lunch money I must testify for her in court to get more child support. I asked her why she didn’t just get a job, and her loud response made me vomit, and the issue has remained ever since. 

I know that my story is not particularly saddening and most children may have been tougher and not let this effect them long term. I guess I am just very sensitive, in fact as I am typing this out I am beginning to feel numb in my hands."

Then I pulled my other hand out of my hoodie pocket and showed them the palm of my hand where the indents of my nails had a thin film of blood over them because I freaking broke the skin of my palm from clenching my hands together so tight. My hands were also shaking so bad I could hardly write anything without it being a bit squiggly on the page. 

I have never seen smiles drop so fast in my life."
Anxiety,I accidentally took 100mg dose of Tofisopam (probably). Will I be okay?,I thought I hadn't taken it so I took again but I probably took it once. I'm currently on 50mg dose per day.
Anxiety,Anxiety caused by my worry of what others think of me,"I’ve had anxiety ever since a few bad experiences almost 10 years ago, which have triggered anxiety that I’ve struggles with ever since. I go into social situations, whether friends or family, or with complete strangers, and I’ll feel vulnerable to physical anxiety symptoms being seen by other people. A few times before, people have noticed the physical anxiety symptoms, mostly dominated by an escalating tremor in my hands or legs if it gets bad enough. It always happens when the spotlight is on me, and more specifically when I have to do a fine task with my hands where they can’t be hidden, and people could notice. I know that there’s not much of a chance that people would notice and even if they did it wouldn’t matter, and I tell myself this constantly, but it just isn’t enough. I don’t know what exactly fuels my problem. It could be self image, where I don’t like the way I look and I’m afraid if what others think of me, or it could be that I just have unshakable performance anxiety. All I know is that recently I’ve found the best way to generally describe my problem, and my problem is that I care too much of what others think of me. I’ve been in therapy in the past, and I’ve tried numerous different medications of all classes, but nothing has worked or been a sustainable help (beta blockers, benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines) . I’m thinking about going to therapy again, but I want to know if anyone who has been in a similar situation as myself has had any luck, and what ways they were able to suppress or even beat the problem. What things do you think or say to yourself before, or while you’re in a situation where you’re trying to beat your physical anxiety symptoms? Even if you aren’t in my boat, what would you suggest I try or do?"
Anxiety,Oh boy fuck this shit,[removed]
Anxiety,Went to r/schizophrenia but FAQ sent me here,"So I (23F) know I have anxiety pretty badly as a symptom of C-PTSD, and while I pretty much know what my anxiety focuses around (usually health and being ""bad"" and death) and how to deal with it, I have been having new intrusive thoughts that scare me and I don't know how to work around them and it's really distracting. Basically, I think that demons are trying to trick me into getting pregnant with the anti Christ? But also like not really I know it's some kind of manifestation of my fear that I am somehow morally tainted and evil, and this is just the irrational and unprovable way my brain has decided to torture me. Im not religious really- raised Catholic but as an adult more agnostic with pagan/Buddhist leaning. This only really started when my very religious aunt informed me that the rapture was happening around us right now, and ever since I can't shake the fear that demons are around, that I am in some kind of secret hell world, and that random things Mean Something to that effect. It's not strong enough to be a delusion, it's just something constantly saying ""what if"" in the back of my mind. It's really annoying and I don't like reading onto things that are pure coincidence, like my boyfriend's video game arrows magically lining up to say 777. Obviously I jump to schizophrenia because of the nature of this fear, so I was just wondering if any other anxiety suffers experience a similar thing and if so, how do you combat it without like. Going to church and losing an important part of your personal identity? 
Thank you"
Anxiety,(Minor TW cutting) didn't turn in my assignment,"It's been 15 days since my last post about this and it's fucking killing me, I once again forgot to do the assignment and my physics teacher just now gave me a vote

This wait has been fucking killing me and he didn't even give me a 2, he gave me some random letters and it doesn't even count in my gpa

I should already have received 3 2 because of other assignments I didn't turn in but he's just making me wait and I can't bear it anymore

Last night at 3 am when I found out the assignment was due today I started cutting, and I did the same last time because I was too stressed and it looks like he wants this"
Anxiety,My mental health is not getting better,I currently live with my parents and I can't stand it anymore. Both of them say things that are hurtful and rude. I feel like I can't do anything and that I'm going to be stuck here forever. :( I want to move out so bad but I can't even afford to right now and I can't get the job I want because I don't have a car to get there or a license.
Anxiety,Does this happen to anyone else?,"So I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I recently started medication (I'm 22, been having bad anxiety since 15 at least). I don't know if its helping, I honestly can't tell at this point, I don't know what my normal is. I feel like I mildly dissociate after taking it and time just passes really fast and before I know it my day is gone. Do other people on meds have this problem? I'm on zoloft right now.

I knew there'd be side effects to taking a medication but it felt like the only option left for me, I tried therapy, stress outlets, exercise, breathing techniques..... but having a panic attack mid-workout was not fun."
Anxiety,I’m too scared to cook!,"We’ve just moved into a new flat (in the uk) share the 
Building with 12 other flats, and if our smoke alarm goes off ALL the smoke alarms go off. 
I set it off the other day. My anxiety is already triggered big time by loud noises in general, but alarms are one of the worst. It’s super high and I couldn’t even reach it when stood on a chair, luckily our next door neighbour is very tall and sorted it out (thought it took ages to turn off) 
The alarm is basically about 1m away from the oven and stove, I’m scared to even boil pasta or cook some toast, and I get anxious when my boyfriend is cooking. 
I’m scared I’m going to upset neighbours, I’m scared of the noise (I never really know why I am scared but I am), I’m scared I’m going to shouted at by annoyed neighbours. 
There’s nothing I can do about the alarm as we rent not own, and I love this flat, but I don’t want to feel like this for 2 years until we buy a house :( idk what to do about it 
I don’t even know if anyone else has experienced this but if you have how did you work to overcome this?"
Anxiety,Agreed to pick up a work day now I regret it,"I'm so overwhelmed I have a toddler, and am so stressed with covid and child care as well as my fiance being in school while I work. I just agreed to add another work day but I regret it so much already. 
My anxiety is telling me not to say anything but I know I'm going to be burnt out and lose my mind. 
How do I discuss with my manager about possibly picking up the extra day on a temporary basis? 
I work in a stressful job that's only been made more stressful with covid and I've talked myself into a corner please help fellow anxiety ridden peeps."
Anxiety,I screwed up due to a very severe bout of anxiety and agoraphobia. Need advice.,"So to try to cut to the point, I’m a 35 year old male. I’ve had anxiety my entire life. I have a prescription for way less xanax than I actually need and adderall for my ADHD. I am horrible about consistency with these and my other meds.

I’m going to physical therapy for a spinal surgery I had in early September. I am in tons of physical pain and not doing great with it. I need to go to a pain management clinic but I am so overwhelmed with doctors and meds and appointments I just haven’t set this up.

For the entire week after Thanksgiving I’ve been up with my dad who is basically the only family I see in person at all anymore. He lives in a small cabin on the lake, it was a vacation property that became his home when my mom divorced him I am up all day and sleeping all night. I’ve had the worst agoraphobia bout of my entire life. I haven’t set foot outside since last Wednesday. I am having trouble picking up the phone.

I didn’t even call my physical therapy to let them know I wasn’t coming and missed two appointments. At this rate I will miss tomorrow too. I don’t know what to tell them and don’t think they will understand so I didn’t call. I’ve been in a house with blackout curtains totally frozen in fear. And I need to go home to my cat who was given plenty of food and water - probably ten days worth, I know I’m a terrible pet owner for not coming back home yet. I need to see her face and hear her voice and I know she’ll forgive me as soon as the food can opens, maybe as soon as she sees me.

I also had an important text from a social worker I have left hanging since Monday. I really need her help and the therapist. What do I say to them? How can I make them understand?

I’m sorry this was so frenzied I’ve been trying to make myself leave and make the 2.5 hr drive home for about 12 hrs now. I’m sure I’ll get it but I’m not sure I have that therapy session in me but I don’t want to lose physical therapy completely."
Anxiety,I can’t stand my job but I am too scared to leave it.,"**TDLR**: I hate my job but im afraid people will be disappointed in me for leaving after only working there a few months, and im scared I won’t be able to find a more suitable job that even pays well, with next to no customer interaction. Severe anxiety is making my life hell.
I don’t know what to do. 


I moved to a completely new state with my boyfriend, who is the hardest worker I have ever seen. He has done jobs and Stuck with them for years despite how difficult they were. He stayed at a darn fred meyers job for minimum wage for FOUR YEARS!

So when I moved in, I looked for my first on-the-books job with the intention of staying there and working hard just like him. Only problem is....I cant stand it. Every day I do this housekeeping job makes me wanna break down on a daily. Equipment doesn’t work, management is a joke, the entire place is a health hazard with black mold we have to scrub near daily because of how poorly rooms were built, I get only $13.25 an hour full time for doing my job PLUS extra jobs that other staff just don’t friggin do, and I hurt so bad after work. Ive only been working there since mid September... How pathetic would I be if I left so soon!?! 

I feel so much anxiety that it cripples me. I am afraid of everyone around me and prefer a life in my room away from everyone. I hate events, parties, and obviously customers. I chose housekeeping because it sounded like the only job I could properly avoid customer interaction. I was a face painter since 2011 and I can’t tell you how difficult it was to breathe when having to constantly interact with people. I just Cant Talk to people. My chest caves every time, I avoid eye contact and just completely shut down. Cleaning rooms by yourself sounded like a damn dream. I still pass the occasional customer or answer a quick question (which is still Beyond hard) but it’s really not often. 

But my body must not be built for this as I am in extreme pain every day after work. I take ibuprofen daily to try and combat it but that’s besides my point. 


What kind of job should I be looking for even if I did leave??? There’s nothing out there that pays a decent living wage AND has next to no customer interaction AND wouldn’t kill my body! And i’m so terrified that people will be disappointed in me for not staying at this job! Im scared my bosses will not speak highly of me if I leave so soon. I am just so scared of everything and it’s such a struggle. My boyfriend is doing all he can to support me, but my anxiety tells me he will look down on me for not just sucking it up and working hard like he does.... 


Please tell me im not alone...Is there a job out there for someone with severe anxiety (as diagnosed by my many therapists)?"
Anxiety,Anxious before performance review - suggestions &amp; tactics,"My anxiety has skyrocketed this year, my former toxic boss left and I worked really hard to project my achievements to my new boss. 

It’s fine to read articles/self help books that tell you to combat anxiety by taking a ‘realistic’ view. What is a realistic view to someone who has known anxiety and abuse their entire life. What’s the difference between toxic thoughts taking over your life and letting yourself off the hook? 

She values humility and to not make a big deal of things. I’m incredibly anxious - although I’ve done well this year and got positive feedback from her many times. 

What are the tactics I can use to get through this weekend &amp; Monday? To appear normal, down to earth and better able to recognise constructive feedback?"
Anxiety,Can’t stop retching,"Hey everyone, I’m just not really sure where to go and I’m quite frankly, at a loss of what to do. 
I’d really appreciate it if anyone has any advice. 

It started about 5 or 6 years ago, I would throw up almost everyday. It got better eventually, and I can control it better. It would just be gagging and retching, and I got back to a healthy weight. 

I thought I could live pretty normally with this minor inconvenience, which I’ve done so for a few years. But I really wish I don’t have to anymore. 

I’ve been seeing a new CBT therapist, but I feel like the retching issue is being brushed aside. So I’m just wondering what can I do in the mean time to deal with this. Until my therapist and I eventually get to working on this issue."
Anxiety,I'm feeling...good?,"So  I recently posted about going to the doctors about panic attacks. It took two appointments and a week on valium while we got blood tests done and a health plan in place. The doctor took me seriously and got me a referral to a therapist which I'm hoping to start soon.

I also started Sertraline this morning before work. I was terrified this morning and expected the worst of the side effects and not being able to cope without the valium. Instead I'm feeling energetic and happy. It was a terrible day at work but all the normal things that would trigger panic or at least severe anxiety caused mild irritation at best. I've made plans to see friends tomorrow.


Can medication work this fast and actually be effective. Or is this just mania and my moods going to fall again? I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop."
Anxiety,Am I crazy,"I don’t know what to do so I’m coming here for help. I feel like I’m going crazy I have been to the hospital many times because I have terrible chest pains. Pain in my left arm, face tingling, tingling in my hands, and constant terrible pain. I have been told nothing is wrong with me and I’m very healthy but I feel like I’m going to die honestly. My heart races I don’t sleep well and i just don’t know if I can take much more am i actually crazy is it anxiety and depression or something else?"
Anxiety,I wint have enough my meds!,"Hey i am taking effexor 150mg and lexapro 5mg. Usualy my oarents send it from croatia tk germany but now it will be late and i will skip efexor for a day or two, what should i do?? Can i go to ambulance or somewhere??"
Anxiety,Has anyone tried a SAD lamp for anxiety?,"I don't really have depression just bad anxiety. I was wondering if anyone had found that a SAD lamp helps with this? I know they're mainly for depression and while a few sites say they can help anxiety, I'm wondering if that's anxiety that's caused by depression if that makes sense? I find I only get depressed if my anxiety is severe and that's because I'm low about feeling anxious not the other way around.

Hope that makes sense!"
Anxiety,Have trouble sleeping :(,What helps you guys sleep? ive had a flare up recently in my anxiety and the second i lay down my mind is racing and before i know it i’m panicked. what helps you guys sleep?
Anxiety,Help - My Sister,"TL;DR - My sister has severe anxiety of leaving the house/ driving, and my parents are enabling it and refuse to admit/ address any problems. It is destroying my relationship with my sister and my parents. 


My sister (26) seems to be suffering with a really bad anxiety disorder and depression. She has always had anxiety but since Lockdown began in the UK in March of this year, she has deteriorated severely. 

She still lives at home with our parents and she has only left the house a handful of times in the last 9 months, and she hasn’t even gone into a shop or any other public place in that time. Any time she does leave the house, she just sits in the car and refuses to get out. She is working from home now and hasn’t even gone to her office to collect an extra monitor/ keyboard, so she’s been working off a laptop since the pandemic began. She makes up excuses any time I suggest that she should go and pick them up as to why she can’t. She has definitely developed a fear of leaving the house (agoraphobia) and sits in the house 24/7 doing nothing except working. 

She never cleans, her room is a mess, she doesn’t look after herself (has put on weight, stopped wearing makeup, lounges in pyjamas all day, doesn’t wash her hair often), she has no hobbies or interests, all she does is sit and watch TV in bed when she isn’t working. She also has a habit of taking a notion of starting something (yoga, lifting weights, etc) but this lasts one or two days and she gives up. She can’t stick to anything. She has been single for two years after breaking up with her fiancé and hasn’t dated once in that time. Mum admitted to me that she thinks my sister broke up with her fiancé as she didn’t want to move out. 

She also seems to have developed a fear of driving her car. My mum had to drive her car home from our nanny’s house for her (my nanny lives two minutes away). She never drives her car now, it just sits in the driveway gathering spider webs. During the week, I sent her a text and asked if she wanted to go for a coffee on Friday (today). She ignored the text and when I went home last night (I live with my boyfriend so only see her once/twice a week), she pretended to have not seen it but agreed to go. I asked her to drive us and she got very panicky, refusing to drive and made up excuses like “I hate drive-thru’s” and offered several times to give me £50 just so I would drive. I refused and she said she wasn’t going. I don’t understand where this fear of driving has come from as she has never been in an accident and used to drive 40 miles each way to and from work before the pandemic. Her reaction last night was ridiculous and really highlighted the problem to me. 

My parents only seem to be making the situation worse, I have tried speaking to them several times about my sister and they deny any problems and get extremely defensive and any conversation about it just leads to an argument. They actually enable all of her behaviour- They drive her everywhere (including a 10 minute drive to the nearest town to get her hair cut), they buy her groceries for her, they do everything for her instead of trying to address the problem. My mum also does everything for her (cooking, washing up, ironing). They are only making it ten times worse and I can’t do anything if they maintain that attitude towards it. 

When I talk to my sister about her behaviour, I finish the conversation feeling pretty positive but that soon disappears when her behaviour continues as is with no improvements. 

I have a fear that she is never going to move out and will be a burden on my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents seem happy to have her there for now but that will wear off eventually, and when it does it will be ugly. It’s their own fault as they have enabled the behaviour and she will not improve at all for as long as they continue doing this. My sister is too scared to talk to anyone (either a doctor or a counsellor) and my mum is refusing to take her to see someone. 

My sister needs help NOW and my boyfriend and I seem to be the only ones that can see it. I am at breaking point, it is affecting my relationship with them all and we used to be such a close family and it is affecting my own mental health now as well. I dread going home to visit them now as it just triggers me seeing my sister wasting her life when she could be so much better. 

Please suggest anything that I can do, I feel like I’ve tried everything and am at the point now where I feel like I have no option but to wash my hands of it, but I know that will haunt me for the rest of my life if my sister’s toxic behaviour continues. I haven’t even covered everything here but hopefully that’s enough for you all to go on. Thanks so much in advance for any help/ advice/ support. 😊"
Anxiety,"Any time I'm injured or sick, I react way out of proportion","So here's what happened today: I was getting out of the bath tub and slipped. Managed to catch myself, so didn't hit my head or anything. But I did get a pretty good hit to an arm and leg.

But because my arm hurts and because my leg feels a bit weak and shaky, I'm worried there's something horribly wrong. Even though I objectively know that those are happening because I just slammed them into something and I'm still shaking a bit from the adrenaline.

Which is to say, the exact same things you'd get from any normal fall. These injuries are so mild that they didn't even cause a bruise, but I still freak out. And I do this with *everything* that happens. And if you asked, I wouldn't even be able to tell you what, exactly, I think is going wrong.

Its really annoying."
Anxiety,All music causing panic attacks?,"I normally cannot listen to music because it is a trigger for me. Repetitive sounds force repetitive thoughts and so fourth. I can deal with music in a store or in a game because I am actively doing something else and I ignore it...

Because of christmas, my coworker has been blasting christmas music from her phone and singing it. I cannot work or focus and it gives me panic attacks. If I drive with music I panic because driving is mindless to me and the sound takes over. 

It just blows me away that so many people find comfort in music, yet it makes me mentally ill. I have been to anxious to tell my coworker to stop, and others like the music its just me. I want to quit at this point because of this person always eating stinky food and blasting music. I stay in the bathroom and cry and vomit and sh from the panic attacks over three times a day. I hate being a wierdo who can't deal with these things, but if I quit no one can cover this part of my hospital. I will also lose my insurance and medical needs will not be acquired."
Anxiety,Does anyone else get really cold when anxious?,"Whenever I get anxious I get so cold I start shivering, many people get hot but I always just get really cold."
Anxiety,Morning anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxiety really bad in the mornings? I wake up earlier and earlier these days because i wake up with anxious thoughts and cannot go back to sleep. Its 6 am right now and ive been up for 2 hours because the first thought I had when I woke up was some stupid thing at work i might have forgotten about. Then I check my phone and it says my google account was hacked while i was asleep. 

So now im just killing time before work but am so stressed out already. No wonder why im so exhausted by noon every damn day.

I just wish I could free my mind in the mornings of all my worry and doubt, but it seems amplified 10x. It makes it really hard to face each day."
Anxiety,Some Thoughts I Needed to Get Out,"I realized I have anxiety... and I hate it. Sometimes I feel a rush of thoughts and sometimes I just shut down. Sometime it takes everything I have just to say something. I feel broken and weak and so mad. I want help and I can get help, but there’s just something really F’d up about having anxiety and wanting help, and having anxiety about getting help... I know what has to be done but I can’t take that step. Anytime I think about it, I get a rush of thoughts and my body will automatically whisper “kill me” to make it stop. Ive never had any suicidal thoughts, but hearing myself say it brings me back to reality. I’ve let myself and so many people down and I don’t want to do it anymore... I already asked a friend for advise and they gave me tons of support and Helpful information. I just don’t know if I can do it. And if I do, I know I will have to face an abundance of other issues and that is what is ultimately terrifying."
Anxiety,Sleepovers,"I f (16)  am sleeping over a a friends house i just started to have a panic attack my friends are in the living room amd I ca hear them laughing im in her room rn I told her I was going to get my pjs on but now I'm shaking and crying and don't know what to do I kind of what to call my mum to take me home but dont know what to tell them. I feel like might be sick.

What do you think i should do?"
Anxiety,Anxiety when my boyfriend smokes weed,"This is ridiculous, but I cant help it. I smoke weed myself, regularly, to help me sleep. Should be fine, right? But when my boyfriend does it, I get severely anxious. Its not like he's high all the time, just before bed. And he's always alone. My therapist can't figure out why it makes me so worried either. I think im crazy sometimes. I'm worried he'll make a dumb decision and hurt himself, or just forget about me. Does anyone else deal with this?"
Anxiety,"anxiety, paranoia and diagnosis","I'm 17 years old and in college. Every since middle school I've thought I had anxiety. But I'm too scared to tell anyone or even go to a doctor because I'm scared they'll tell me I don't have anxiety or anything. I don't know why but yeah.

When I was in elementary school I used to stay up really late and eventually fall asleep out of fatigue or just cry myself to sleep because I would have really bad paranoia at night for absolutely no reason. Its gotten better since then but I feel like it's coming back.

In public I never feel comfortable. I feel self conscious about how I walk, how I sit, my posture, how I look, how I talk and I over think so God damn much. I can barely get sentences out because I'm so worried about how I'm saying it that I don't think about what I'm gonna say next. Im not even comfortable around my own family. I get so much anxiety doing anything outside of my own home, especially alone. 

Im starting to feel hopeless. I've lost motivation to get out of my bed. I've lost motivation to go to sleep or even eat. Im scared to talk to my friends. I just don't see a point in anything anymore. Only reason I get out of bed is to play video games. I even gave up on one of my premed classes and im gonna fail it.

Should I go to a doctor? Is there anything a doctor could even give me that's worth it? Should I tell someone? I'm just so scared of my thoughts being invalidated. I just need something. 

I just don't want to go to therapy. And I'm scared my parents take me if I say anything. Either that or they tell me its not that big of a deal."
Anxiety,Anxiety I think causes me to be impatient with people and come across rude especially with family but not at work I am meek and timid,"I obviously don’t want to come across rude to my family but I do get angry with them quickly, whenever they criticise me or talk about something which is pointless. Whenever I present an idea and they shoot me down I get frustrated or if I like something and they don’t I get annoyed. If they try and take over from something I’m doing to help me I feel annoyed even though I know they want to help I feel they are annoyed at me for taking too long. I feel like these are attributes of a teenager not an adult. I am ashamed and I want to be better. 

At work I’m not like this I’m polite and quiet I do my work and I am patient with people. I do get anxious at work but it is more about me and my performance. When I get critiqued at work I understand their point of view I do get a bit defensive which I have stopped now I know they are saying it to better me. I feel at work critique is manageable as I can just do a plan and work on it. Whereas with family they just say you have a rude tone sort it out.. like how?? 

Any advice? If you can tell me why I do this that would be helpful. I think apart of it is low self esteem but why is it only with family? 

Thanks"
Anxiety,Just printed my 2 weeks notice,"I’m majorly freaking out. My mental health has not been the greatest and my husband and I both feel like it would be best for me to quit my current job. My plan is to do it today.

I know I care wayyy too much about what they will think and how my coworkers will react and that in reality, I do not owe them anything, but my heart is still pounding and my stomach is in knots.

This won’t really come as a shock to most of my coworkers as they mostly know how stressed and drained I am. I think upper management and my supervisor will be completely blindsided and I have a feeling they will question me and my decision.

My biggest fear is physically handing the notice to my supervisor and my current plan is to try and find a time where she isn’t in her office, leave it on her desk, and email her saying that if she would like to talk about it, I’m free. The thought of physically giving it to her and watching her read it is mortifying. The problem is she’s ALWAYS in her office. She sits at her desk all day. Fingers crossed I can get my notice in without puking or having a mental breakdown! 🤞🏻"
Anxiety,Dealing with anxiety disorder without meds?,"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing well. I suffer from anxiety disorder that comes with depression and panic attacks, and all I ever did is get medicine, but I am tired of them. Missing one dosage and I feel terrible. Also learning new things is a pain, I am in university and I barely manage to learn anything new. Is there a way I can deal with anxiety and depression without medicine? I'd love to hear your stories and feedback."
Anxiety,Weird head feelings due to anxiety/stress,"Anyone else’s head feel weird at times like a spaced out, lightheaded type of feeling. Where you look around and it’s feel like it’s in slow motion. Maybe like you be had one to many and maybe feel a little unsteady. I suffer with health anxiety but i do try keep telling me it’s the anxiety and stress or even maybe eye strain from too much video games ha."
Anxiety,I need to get this off my chest,"I really don't know were to start. So I've been dealing with anxiety for a long time now. I suffered really bad from it but im better now. So im 15 years old but I remember that some day 2 years ago my anxiety started. At this time i didn't even know clearly what anxiety was and i had no idea i suffered from it. It all started when  before going to sleep I would overthink a lot and make myself nauseous in some way? Idk how to explain but my heart rate would go up and i would feel really really nauseous. This happened when i felt lonely but i didn't know that until now. So my parents got divorced when I was like 9 and they've always been there for me, but not emotionally. Of course I could approach them and tell them my personal problems but they were never there. My dad was always working and on the weekends when sometimes i would go to his apartment id rather not spill alll my problems and ruin the weekend. The same happened with my mom , i live with her but she's never here. Im so thankful for both my hardworking parents but they were never there for me. Since I was small i remember my mom asking me what should she buy for me, and she would bring me a lot of things just to compensate the time we were not together. Now thinking about it my life was so depressing back then. I literally got ready for school, went to school were i got bullied for almost 2 years, then got home and ate alone, did my homework, try to tell my little brother not to break things, and maybe give him food and stuff, and my mom would just come back at night and not even say hi. Well going back to the anxiety thing, yes that happened for 3 years. I slept for almost a entire year at 2am when i was like 13 because i was afraid to vomit and i couldn't sleep, and i would be all shaky. Now that i think about i think it was me unconsciously wanting by moms attention, and this anxiety only happened at night because its the only time she was available lol. You may think my mom worked all day, well sorry to break it to you but no, she literally would go and eat with her friends instead of me and my brother, and at night she would go to parties and not come back till the next day at night. I was at my lowest point when in front of my dad i had my first anxiety attack. It was the worst. Deadass i want to cry right now remembering how i cried and shaked in bed all nauseous at my dads apartment after he picked me up at a party cause i was not feeling well. When we were in the stairs up to his apartment i fell down crying cause i couldn't take it anymore and he just stared at me and went upstairs. I also had several anxiety attacks with my mom and she would do nothing. I had to cry silently in my room cause she had to sleep. Then somehow I took control of myself and i discovered all this im talking about and im better now. Much better. My anxiety however came back last year when my relationship with my mom went worse than it already was. So she got a boyfriend, and she had never presented me any of her boyfriends ever before so this was new to me. He was a nice dude but I didn't really love him or hate him. Any little thing i said to him she would overthink it and then when he was gone, she would scold me really badly about it. Like one time I was going to a friends house and I passed to the kitchen fast and I was in a hurry and my mom and him were there so i just gave him a quick hug of like hello and then went and my mom got mad at that. I hated her boyfriend because thanks to him she was less in the house. I literally would not see her in days. Or there were weeks were all i would say to her was, can you please buy more apples lol. Then somehow i found out he cheated on her 2 times and still got back together, but now they broke up again. Also when i want to talk to my dad he is busy or ignores me or just listens to me with a face of i don't give a fuck what your saying. I feel so fucking lonely, like  i really can't anymore. Im not suicidal though. Ive thought of it but its too scary. Also i hate school, like the workload is too much for a 15 year old. I have friends but they don't get me at all. And i kind of have trust issues. I also don't like the way I look, and when i talked to my mom about maybe getting a minor nose job she got all excited and sad, yessss and you should get your chin done too. Since then i feel like my chin is wrong someway. I also never can sleep because i overthink but not in a depressing way i just overthink. Also my relationship with my younger brother sucks. And that makes me really hurt because i feel like he's the only one that could kind of understand me and apart from that HES MY BROTHER. Im tired of life. More with this pandemic going on."
Anxiety,One for the girls. Ovulation &amp; Panic Attacks...?,The ONLY time I have panic attacks are from the day of ovulation... Anyone have any advice for this? Or have a similar situation? (Ssri's not an option)

Anxiety,"Air hunger, anyone else? Anxiety I think.","I know this is somewhat unorthodox, but about a month ago my mom started choking suddenly. It was really bad but she was alright after an hour. Since then I feel anxious even when someone midly coughs(The covid pandemic has multiplied this feeling I guess). I think this has manifested into                air-hunger/shortness of breathe in me. Gastritis doesn't help either. 

Anyway, I had this air-hunger like three weeks ago. It was intense for 2-3 days when I thought I couldn't take a deep breathe. This subsided for sometime(about a week). I could take deep breathe but I would still have this urge to take a deep breathe every now and then.  I was fine. But since yesterday I again have developed this urge to take a deep breath every now and then.  A light dizziness too.

&amp;#x200B;

 The pattern of circumstances that lead to this twice is also quite similar. About a month ago our internet was down for a day, exactly at that day my shortness of breathe seem to peak. Our internet was down day before yesterday and since then my air hunger increased again.  I don't think this means anything but still.

Also, I was following USA election rigorously for like 3-4 days straight and it was a rollercoaster of emotion(I am not even from the US, I don't even know why I was so interested). Around the same time I was following covid news a lot. I think this got the best of me and gave me anxiety. I think this has contributed so wanted to put it out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Ps. I am sure this doesn't mean anything but I had a parasitic worm(prolly pinworm) some days ago and I took albendazole twice, today I got my stool checked again I was free from the worm. So yay I guess.."
Anxiety,My Mind Keeps Finding New Worries?,"Sometimes it feels like every time I'm able to identify and feel better about one stressor which is triggering my anxiety (e.g. recognizing that COVID is making me feel a lot of time pressure, that I'm experiencing stuff with my family), my mind literally searches to find something else to wake me up in the morning with and make me feel panicked about. I'm just like...why won't my anxious body leave me alone? Why does every anxious thought have to turn into nausea and fear?

Anxiety,Sudden Cortisol Anxiety,"Hello. For the past month and out of nowhere i've been waking up with anxiety which seems to follow my cortisol pattern. To picture it better, my anxiety is waking me up by giving me some nausea and weird anxious feeling even when dreaming just before waking up so it's purely physical. Once i'm awake the anxiety last a couple of hours and seems to go away. The evening i feel good. I've never been anxious like this before and there is literaly no triggers for me to be anxious, my life is great.

The crazy part is that if i wake up one hour before my usual wake up time i feel fine. It appeared out of nowhere and i also get other symptoms such as muscle spasm, loose stools and no appetit.

Did any of you had that before ? btw i have no medical issues."

Anxiety,Anxiety coupled with zoom triggered paranoia?,"**Background:** My life, just like the life of many others has been completely online since March. My work is exhausting and demanding, and althought not going to the office has it's benefits, I feel like now I am expected to be available 24/7. Several months ago, while still working, I moved to another country and started a very demanding academic programme. Still - life is on Zoom. Socializing in non-existent. Lately, I have been experiencing anxiety/panic attacs  but now - infused with paranoia. 

Sometimes I am not sure if I say things aloud that people hear me or not in these zoom meetings and lectures. I spend all my time alone, if I am not on zoom, I talk to myself as I study. 

**In short:** Normal life turned  completely online. Now experiencing massive amounts of anxiety infused with paranoia that people can hear/see me do things I do not want them to. 

**Question:** Has anyone had a similar experience and how to cope with this strange and alarming sensation?"
Anxiety,Woke up with anxiety on a girls trip,I am with 4 of my friends on a vacation and I just woke up with the worst anxiety. I am scared I am going to have a panic attack and freak everyone out because they aren’t the best with anxiety. Pls help
Anxiety,I have this horrible anxiety that people are always listening,"Ever since I can remember, if I’ve ever spoken about someone to someone else (say, something they did or said) I have this paranoia that they are somehow listening. Like.. I’m accidentally recording it or we’re somehow accidentally on a phone call. I got it as a young kid a lot, if I was doing something embarrassing I was terrified that everyone from my school would actually be watching (even alone at home) and I’d be humiliated. It makes it quite hard to speak openly out loud, I’ve had to turn off my phone fully in therapy sessions and stuff and it makes me speak as if the people are always listening. I even write in journals as if they’re reading it. I don’t know how to get over this or stop having this worry?"

Anxiety,Anxious Ticking,"My mind has a habit of blocking thoughts (to a degree). So my anxiety comes out in physical forms. Like anxious ticks, such as sudden head jerks, a clicking noise with my tongue and suddenly slapping a table (if I'm sitting at one).

Anxiety,I messed up,"So it's something simple. But my Boss buys us lunch occasionally, and he even once gave me a fit bit he just had laying around his house. Granted he wasn't using it but it was cool of him.

Today my kid who works with me brought me two sausage egg biscuts for breakfast. I couldn't eat both and offered one to my coworker, in part because I know my boss is often concerned about his weight. He was probably just messing with me but he came out, jokingly made a comment that I didn't bring enough for everyone, and then saw my coworker with it and said ""Shit, he got one!"" 

I played it off, and joked with them, but now I feel terrible. So much anxiety and craziness now, and wishing I would have offered the extra to him first. Stupid little things like this set me off all the time."
Anxiety,Losing my mind?,"Recently I've been feeling as though my thoughts and actions aren't my own. Like some other force is forcing me into the life I live. 

I don't care about money, I don't want too. Yet I do because it's needed too live... I work myself to the bone every god damn day for only just enough and there are those out there who never lift a finger and have all of the shit. How does money work? Where does it come from? Who decided I need it for food? Who decided that this is how hard I must work too just get by? And get by for what? What am I doing? Keeping this shitty society from collapsing? I don't like the society so why am I forced into helping it keep afloat?

I was born with congenital toxoplasmosis (look it up) and have been feeling like it's the reason for my thinking process and how racey and weird it can be. 

I think there's a society of individuals, above government, only out for their own benefit running this whole damn show and forcing everyone through psychological manipulation to keep their shit show running cause it benefits them, we're nothing but pawns for them, tools too make their lives better. I'm a tool, nothing more, my pain doesn't matter as long as the job is done and they force me to get the job done by making money something we need too live and drip feeding us juuuust enough too live and by making it a status symbol so that we crave more so that we work longer and harder hours to get more so that we can be seen as a valuable and attractive member of society. 

I don't wanna sleep, I must sleep.

Maybe it's not the parasite, maybe it's the master society making me insane by depriving me of human needs? I don't even know what human needs are... food and water is one, shelter, socialization is but what's under the umbrella of socialization? I dunno maybe there's something I'm not getting that's making me loopy, maybe it's the parasite? I dunno. Doctors don't care, other people don't care. Every day is a scary and blurry mess. Is western society one giant fuck up that people need too be sedated to go along with? Is a parasite in my head making me paranoid? Honestly, I have no idea. I just know the thoughts hardly stop. Never finishing a sentence in my head. Nothing is congruent, everything is confusing.

Anxiety,"Anxiety induced ""Hangover""","Context: I'm an essential worker for a vet clinic dealing with an anxiety disorder. Recently I've found out my beloved pet of 19 years is going to be passing away soon and it triggered a massive anxiety attack after work yesterday evening.

Anxiety,This is making me really anxious.,"Hi guys,

So over the past week now I have been somewhat anxious about my intrusive thoughts. Below are examples of them but before I tell you them, I have an immense fear of developing schizophrenia or psychosis.

1. Worried about what if my family don’t love me.
2. What if people bugged my car, how would I know.
3. What if my girlfriends parent want to harm me when I come over to stay.
4. What if my food was poisoned
5. Earlier on my cat followed my mum upstairs and I automatically got the thought of “are they going upstairs to plan to hurt me” it give me unbelievable anxiety and as much as I know the thought is absolutely shocking and obscene but my ocd made me question my own thinking if it WAS real or not 🙄

I’m guessing OCD can make you doubt your rationalised thinking? Like it will be “ok but what if you actually do believe it and you don’t know it” has anyone else ever had anything like this and btw this isn’t every day this waxes and wanes throughout the year and there is times when I don’t think this but it puts me in so much panic it’s unbelievable.

Also, if it’s not a what If thought, does this mean it’s not OCD? What I mean by this is what if I had a thought differently from “what if my foods poisoned” what if the thought was “they could poison my food” but I still get the terrible anxiety from it. Hope this makes sense. So does it need to be a what If thought for it to be OCD and not schiz or can it appear in your head any old way and still be OCD ?

Thanks,
Brandon"
Anxiety,Random spurt of anxiety,"Hi everyone! So I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety for a while but ever since May I’ve been having an interesting problem. I will be in a conversation with one person or a group of people and then become overwhelmed with what I believe to be social anxiety and sadness. My heart will start beating fast and I would have to keep myself from frowning (my mouth will keep twitching trying to frown). Also I will feel like I have to cry out of nowhere which makes me more anxious because I don’t know what’s going on. These feelings will happen mostly during the times when I’m listening mostly in the conversation. 

The only way I can usually get it to stop is to bury my face in my phone and try to calm down. Or sometimes it just won’t stop and I either ride it out or exit the conversation. 

Has anyone else experience this and have any tips? It doesn’t happen all the time, but I would like it to stop or figure out the cause because it doesn’t happen during every conversation."
Anxiety,Going to the grocery store is hard,"I get so nervous thinking about going to the store. It’s worse when I’m there. I feel like I’m always in someone’s way. I can’t peacefully browse. There’s always someone’s cart right at your ankles so you can’t even walk slowly. Whenever I need something, there’s always something or someone blocking it in the aisle. Usually I’ll leave without getting what I need because of it.
If I have a minor bad experience I think about it for weeks. Of how badly I inconvenienced someone and that I was in their way. 
I wish I could just go to the store like any other person and think nothing of it :("

How can I get better at this? it's happaned a few times now and each time increases my anxiety, I start panicking 2-3 hours before meeting up unless I am 100% certain that it will happen, it's really bothering me. How can I learn to deal with it?

Anxiety,Night Walking in the Cities of Japan,"I've traveled around a lot of Japanese cities since living here for the past 6 years. I've been married for about 3 years and have a little cute baby Max, but for some reason when I travel for work away from the family, I am always drawn to going out and exploring the nightlife when I travel alone. Walking around Hiroshima city and Iwakuni city recently by myself I always find myself longing to hit the town walking the dark streets at night and finding others to hang out with or talk to while sharing a lemon sour or chu-hai from the nearby sake mart or 7/11. Most if not all of my friends have left Japan and I am soon to be the last one left for a while. I'm not quite sure why I do it, but I feel the need to go out and about aimlessly wandering the roads and drinking at the parks looking for new friendships.  I want to have those same party and clubbing experiences I did in my early 20s, but nowadays I find myself wanting more but compromising with a beer or two with dinner at Home once or twice a month with my family, but I live through the experiences of my juniors telling their own stories of their nights out in the town. Does anyone feel the same? It might just be a mid 20s thing I am trying to get over with before I get old."
Anxiety,Sharp Chest Pains due to Anxiety?,"Hello everyone, I’m just a little anxious right now because I woke up with really sharp chest pains. It kinda feels like someone is stabbing me. I’m getting really anxious and my heart keeps skipping beats because I can’t stop thinking if anything is wrong with me. Do you all experience something like this as well or should I be concerned?"
Anxiety,I had a very strange experience falling asleep last night. Continuous waves of panic.,"I have anxiety disorder but I very rarely get serious panic attacks. I also have delayed sleep phase disorder (this is a neurological disorder and not a mental disorder) and I'm in the habit of staying up until like 3 am, which I am trying to break due to a new job. I went to sleep at 1 am last night. I normally sleep soundly if later than usual though.

Last night, I was very tired, but every time I tried to fall asleep I would be jolted awake a minute later by a sudden surge of panic. This has happened to me before, but quite rarely, and it has never happened to me multiple times in a row. Last night, it happened dozens of times before I finally fell asleep. I slept normally and woke up well rested after that.

I was half-dreaming about Hunter x Hunter, which makes sense as it was the last thing I looked at before sleeping. Sometimes I would see disturbing images in my head, like the show insisted on showing me a graphic image of a woman being crushed to death over and over and I kept seeing that in my head. I don't easily get scared by media but this scene bothered me. HOWEVER most of the time the image in my head when I felt a surge of panic was completely benign, like I would see Killua who is my favorite character just standing there and I would feel a sudden wave of intense fear.

I tried forcing myself to focus on positive imagery. It didn't work, as soon as I started to drift off into deep sleep the panic suddenly returned. I also imagined my own ego was detached from my body and I was a third party observer from myself, which is pretty easy for me due to my experience with meditation. This didn't help because I would still be consumed by panic and immediately come back to myself.

My new job is delivering packages for UPS. Yesterday was my first day and it was honestly way easier than I expected. My biggest fear is making a minor mistake or becoming bored. However in the past I have avoided getting any jobs at all due to anxiety and this is honestly the first full time job I've ever had in my life even though I'm at least a decade too old for my level of inexperience. I don't think I'm afraid of the job but I'm not that aware of my own emotions. Most of the time I'm pretty calm and patient but I can never tell what's going to set me off.

Now I'm awake and I'm well rested and I'm ready for work but I'm terrified of what happened to me last night. Nothing has like this has ever happened to me before. I've never heard of it happening to anyone else. What's going on?"

Anxiety,Set an appointment with yourself for worry-relief,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share something I've been doing this week that has worked fantastic for me even though I was really skeptical. I have the tendency to worry all day every day about not just things going on in my life but also every symptom I feel in my body. My tight throat has me worried if it's anxiety or something else that I could be going to the doctor about, and I think about these type of things constantly though the day. As you can imagine, this only makes my anxiety worse.

I've been setting 15 minute worry appointments with myself, which is a technique I read about to stop ruminating. Basically at 4 pm every day I sit in a quiet spot and have a little therapy session with myself where I'm allowed to worry about everything and anything bothering me, any anxious thought and any symptom-googling I want to do or catastrophizing I want to do, I do it during my 15 minute worry session. All other times of the day when a worry pops up I tell myself, ""I'm not going to go over this with  myself now, I'm going to save it for then ext worry session."" 

I have to be honest, I didn't think I could stop the worry then and there and save it for later, but I think knowing I have a time where I am allowed to do it really worked. I'm realizing that during my 15 minute 4pm session, I often try to think about the things bothering me and they don't really feel so serious anymore. Maybe it's the fact that they lose their power when they don't take over my anxious mind, I'm not sure. I actually am feeling so much better by the end of this week just by those 15 minutes each day. I think you should try it if you have the same issue@"

So my parents are 49 and 50 years old and they are having friends over for dinner tomorrow (both the same age as my parents approx.) and I’m super anxious about it.

I tried to talk them out of it but there’s nothing to do, I’ve been crying all day.

They’ve been super careful and it’s the first people they will see in a big while so I don’t get why they have to see friends all of the sudden.

They are healthy and are still respecting the government’s guidelines by having them over so there’s no making them change their minds.

I just need a bit of emotional support because I’m afraid to lose them😔"

Anxiety,What can I do to not let my anxiety take over when I'm texting with friends?,"I made a friend over Instagram recently and we clicked right away. We talk with each other all the time and have a lot in common, which is really nice! But for some reason I have this feeling that I don't deserve to be friends with her. 

I constantly overanalyze the messages that I send and am like 'was that a stupid thing to say?' 'does she think I'm weird?' 'does she still want to talk to me or is she just being nice?'. And I know none of these things are true, but my brain still thinks that they are. I'm also nervous to send her pictures and videos of myself because I'm not happy with how I look and sound over video, but she sends me videos sometimes so I want to as well. 

It's incredibly annoying because I trust her and we're good friends at this point, but I'm having a lot of trouble just having a normal conversation. What can I do to just relax and be more like myself without questioning every text I send or receive? Thanks :)"

Anxiety,i can’t believe there are people that don’t feel like this,i was watching this 19 year old youtuber the other day that says she had never dealt with bad mental health at all and she’s a relatively happy person and it just hit me that not everyone experiences this. imagine having such a perfect life with no social problems or ruts you get stuck in and not having this horrible feeling you can’t shake off that can literally make you depressed and shut yourself out from the world. i just think i would be unstoppable if i wasn’t always anxious and sad and i’m so jealous of people who don’t suffer from this because i can’t imagine a life with out it. god has favourites

Anxiety,New Medicine Symptoms,"Hi all! So I started a new medication to help with my life long anxiety and depression. I’m in the first week and a half and it’s not going well. I was told it could have the opposite effect on the beginning, but I just was hoping someone out there knew from experience how long it would last. I do breathing exercise no joke literally all day everyday instead of normal breathing to keep myself from getting that weird heart/chest tightness. The anxiety gets so much worse at night and it’s becoming unbearable. Was hoping, like I said before, someone knows how long this may last? And may have some tips to keeping myself calm. The main things that bothers me the most is the heart thing weirdly enough.

Anxiety,Waiting for graduation approval,"So in my uni the approval takes long.

Will I be ok??? And is this ok to go this long with this mess up sleep??? I only got 5 hours of sleep tonight and feel free already and I haven’t even left my bed but I feel tried and can’t go back to sleep. And will I be stuck like this???
Anxiety,Fighting through this! OH and today is my birthday!!!,"Some days I rarely want to leave the house but today is my day and i'll enjoy every minute of it :))

Turned 27 today!"
Anxiety,Just wanted to say this,How is it 2020 and there is no “magic” pill that you take with ZERO SIDE EFFECTS and it just makes physical anxiety symptoms go away?? Ive been dealing with health anxiety now for 3 years and am totally sick of it. I KNOW that my heart is fine but i just cannot shake worrying about it... like dr.s must have missed something. Very annoying to the point that i am just getting mad at myself. If this annoying chest tickling sensation would just go away i feel like i would be ok. But this constant cycle of worrying about why i have this anxiety system and maybe its my heart is just killing me. Now i just spend my time worrying that my constant WORRY is going to giving to raise my blood pressure and indirectly i am killing myself. This is just so debilitating. Thanks for the vent and feel free to comment :)
Anxiety,Health anxiety,"My health anxiety comes and goes and it’s been really bad this week that I constantly feel very physically ill such as chest pains, back pains, nauseas, light headed and shaky. Then those symptoms make me think even more and I’m constantly calling the doctor and they’re telling me I’m OK and I’m second guessing them. 

It’s a vicious never ending cycle. HELP!"
Anxiety,Anxiety at work,"I'm autistic and have had anxiety/social anxiety at work for as long as I can remember that is getting worse over time. I've changed jobs/industries multiple times but because I am slow, stupid and uncommunicative I am not able to get on anywhere. I haven't been able to find a job with a bearable level of anxiety and have no skills or things I am good at to be a productive person. 

My most recent breakdown was a month ago where the doctor signed me off of work for three weeks. My mood improved rapidly and I stopped harming/ having intrusive suicidal thoughts during this time off. I've been back for a week and all the anxiety has come back on top of me like a ton of bricks. I've already reduced my hours down to as much as economically possible but it has not helped much at all.

I am in therapy and on medications but they have not helped. My therapy is geared very much towards keeping me in work. I try and tell myself (just a few more hours till the end of the day, just a few more days until Friday etc. but then the thought that working doesn't end for decades comes into my mind and I become overwhelmed and panicked again. 

I've tried my hardest to find a productive role I can tolerate but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything that doesn't cause people not to rush me or interact with others or have stakes or timings that I find difficult. I feel so exhausted by the anxiety of trying to do tasks in work that I feel so miserable outside of work that I do not leave my bed anymore. Even 'hello' to a colleague takes so much effort and exhausts me."

Anxiety,Anxiety,"So I have a huge anxiety problem, I tend to quit jobs even when I know I shouldn’t. I got a job as a housekeeper at a nursing home and was wanting some advice. Is it easy?

Anxiety,Health/Mental Health Anxiety,"Hello r/anxiety! 

I’ve been lurking for a little bit but I feel as though I’ve come to my wits end. 

I had my first full-blown panic attack a few months ago, and have had a few more sporadically since. However this last week had been absolute insanity. 

I typically have health anxiety, worrying that I have some kind of underlying condition. However the intensity of the anxiety has now escalated into me worrying that I am mentally unstable and this problem will not go away. 

For example, last night I was panicking so bad that I felt like I was crawling out of my own skin, and that this wasn’t reality and I would wake up strapped down in a hospital. 

Does anyone else experience this? Should I be seriously concerned? I do have an appointment scheduled for this coming Tuesday, but this is now a daily thing."
Anxiety,Can I drink alcohol with a panick/anxiety disorder?,I don't like asking this question to my therapist cause I think she might assume i'm alcoholic. I genuinly enjoyed having a drink every now and then but ever since my anxiety/panick attacks which started a few months ago. I haven't had a drop (which doesn't botter me all too much) But since it's weekend and sometimes I just like to unwind like I used to before my disorder I'm a bit afraid of returning attacks and since my deal is that I'd like a explanation for everything before I decide to do something. I rarely drink (maybe 1 night every few months) but I did enjoy the times that I did. I'm wondering what the risk contains or if there are even risks (for reference I haven't had a panick/anxiety attack for 1 month now and I do feel pretty confident to drink but I just want to ask if anyone else still drinks after their attacks just to put myself at ease)
Anxiety,Please help me.,"So, recently I feel like I always have to take a deep breath in order for my brain to get the oxygen it needs. I started to get very anxious but my heart doesn’t race and I start to tremble. I also get very blurred vision and feel as if I am going to faint but it has not happened. Is this anxiety or something else? I have a doctors apt in the 8th but I’d love other input. Thank you!"
Anxiety,Anxiety and a Pandemic do not go well together. p.s. WEAR A MASK / STAY HOME,"I hate anxiety, and I hate these people who are not taking COVID and Social Distancing seriously.

I already have a hard time taking to people, and you can forget having me be the first one to text you and start a convo. I over think, and feel like I am being annoying and bothering someone just saying Hey. So texts just end up sitting  there unsent, (I am aware I do it and shouldn't, but no matter how hard I try I can't not do it, it actually hurts trying to even think about hitting the send button).

This pandemic has kept me from being able to hang out and talk to my person (the only person I can call my friend). I just found out from someone else that my person just made a big life changing move and I would have know if I was able to hang out and see them. But because there are all these inconsiderate jerks out here refusing to wear masks, stay home, and QUIT THROWING PARTIES, I having seen/spoken to them in weeks/months.

And I want to ask them about it, but I don't want to force them to tell me, yet I don't want them to think I don't care."
Anxiety,"Just started taking escitalopram for anxiety. After my first dose, the side effects were unbearable.","My doctor said that there would likely be side effects, but they would go away after a week or two. Last night, an hour after taking them the Nausea was so unbearable, I threw up several times. I couldn't close my eyes because my mind just kept racing. It felt like a bad trip. It ended up causing more anxiety than I previously had in the first place. I'm terrified of taking the second dose. I emailed my doctor for advice, but he probably won't get back to me for a few days. Has anyone had similar experiences?"

Anxiety,Work makes us rate our mental states,My work makes us rank our mental states in Friday meetings   -5 to 5. In front of everyone. I’m having so much anxiety because I am so bad today and I don’t want to say out loud that I’m not ok in front of my coworkers. I struggled to make it here today and now I’m dreading going into this meeting. I’m sick of saying I’m fine. I know I have to put my work face on and just finish my day but I’m drowning in my anxiety and I feel voiceless and alone.
Anxiety,Are you kidding me?,"There was a screaming match between my neighbours yesterday. It got so bad that their front door was damaged and several people called police. 

This morning? A FIRE. I had get out of bed, put clothes on and sprint down ELEVEN flights of stairs while carrying my terrified cat in her cage. 

I had a massive panic attack both days."
Anxiety,Not eating helps with my anxiety?,"My best days have been days I've purposely skipped meals. I  feel really calm and focused, it's like my anxiety is almost gone. 

I normally have a lot of trouble eating but I'm usually able to force my meals down. I don't suffer from anorexia and I don't have strong body positivity issues, but I still purposely miss meals sometimes. I haven't eaten or drinkin at all today and was actually able to stay engaged in class and calm during conversation with my classmates.

I'm really confused why this is. I know later this evening I'm going to crash and feel like shit but it really helps and I don't know why. I do suffer from self harm and I'm not sure if thats connected. It's worth noting that self harm helps with my appetite (I've been clean for a little bit so eating has been really hard).

Has anyone else experienced this or has advice on eating more? Thank you so much for reading 💙."

Anxiety,Physical symptoms from election anxiety,"I didn't think this election was gonna make me nervous cuz I be smoking ouid a lot &amp; I've become very numb to most things. But for the past couple of nights I've been pulling my hair out in my sleep (like wtf 😣😣😣) and my arms, hands, &amp; legs get suuuuuper itchy. And I know these things only happen when I'm feeling anxious ughhh I guess I'm in denial or something. I'm strangely optimistic about the results but at the same time I can't even fathom how insane this election is &amp; how it's completely divided the country, I feel like I'm watching a horror movie but it's literally the damn news 😞"

Anxiety,Anxious person going through multiple changes,"I’m a very anxious person but am currently on anxiety medication which helps. But I’ve gone through multiple changes lately that I can’t seem to handle very well!
I’m in NZ so COVID doesn’t play into this but in the last month, I have quit my job, moved cities and into my boyfriends house who I was doing long distance with and his six year old son. I am three weeks into a new job and haven’t had much of a break.
I’ve gone from looking only after myself, and thinking about me, to being a companion to my partner on a new level. I have no vehicle and although I’m on the hunt, I feel less independent. 
Basically, I’m struggling, missing my old life a bit and wondering how to keep staying strong!"
Anxiety,"Last night, I had a partial panic attack because I thought the world was gonna end from a black hole.","I don't know what happened! Right before bed, that just came to mind, and I was fucking panicking, just imagining horrific situations, and imagjne me dying. Thankfully, what calmed me down, was putting logic into my fear, and breathing. I'm almost proud of myself. 

But... It was horrible, I've never felt such vivid unrealistic fear ever! It was terrifying. I hope I never have anything like that again."
Anxiety,?,is derealization basically like when ur so severely anxious about it nothing feels real like the fact that what ur anxious about is making u so scared that like it just doesn’t feel real because sometimes i get that and i’m not sure if it’s derealization
Anxiety,What helped ease your anxiety so it wasn’t occurring 24/7,"Like many on here I experience anxiety quite serve lately that my regular medication is not helping with. I’ve started a new job and I cannot tell if it truely it’s not right for me or it’s my anxiety. I wake up worried and alarmed - I go to sleep worried and alarmed. I’d say currently there is not one moment of the day that I’m not feeling anxious and my mind is going astray thinking about regrets In the past, worrying i’m going to die alone or be sacked abruptly amongst the million other worries I have. 

My question is has anyone successfully quieten their mind? Like all of us can tesify we constantly get told, meditation, yoga. I’ve tried both and i’m so highly strung/anxious I cannot get into either. Medication is obviously not working great but i’ll stay on it. Any other things that have worked for you?? Thanks in advance from someone at her wits end (I don’t want to waste life feeling this way 😢)"

Anxiety,I don't know how to get a job!,"Anxiety and depression has been holding me back for so many years! I've spent all my life indoors. Seriously. I only ever out to go to school or uni. 

I never developed social skills and I don't know how basic things are done, like getting a job. I used to think this fear was just normal, but after seeing a therapist, he said it's depression and anxiety. 

I over think everything. I'm 25 now and I'm still sitting at home not sure what to do with my life. My parents never yell at me for not having a job, but I wish they would. It could be the push I need to get through this.

Why can't I just die."

She wasn’t abusive but she was rude, and a lot of the time I would deal with this okay but my mental health has been a bit ehhhh lately. She was really intimidating to me.
All over smokes. (Supermarket)
I’m so embarrassed, especially in front of one of my coworkers and managers,  I felt so bad.
I can’t stop thinking about it now.

Anxiety,Panicking about doctors and disability claim,"I left work 3 weeks ago after having a panic attack for my first time and essentially a mental breakdown. Fast forward to last week when my employers insurance contacts me and explains I need to prove I am completely disabled to qualify for benefits. Have been panicking all day every day how I can talk to the doctor and have them believe me. Now just went down a google hole to learn that even if a doctor supports me that it likely will not be approved. I know it's my own fault I've wound up here but I can't even get out of bed, how can I work? I have councelling starting this week but my mind needs some time to be calm and after talking to the insurance I've been in like full panic mode for so long I just want to be able to calm down. Everyone wants to know when I think I will return to work and I feel like I cant and if I am forced to.... I'll feel even worse about myself and what I've been going through and how I'm failing and I just feel like I need time and everyone surely thinks I'm taking advantage:( sometimes I cant even breath and this is literally all I think about. I just want to relax so I can feel better :(. Sorry for the ramble. Any experiences or kind words or advice is appreciated."

Anxiety,Anxiety over asking to spend time with boyfriend,"For some reason I feel selfish for asking to spend time with my boyfriend?

I don’t know if this stems from not feeling good enough but I always feel selfish for wanting to spend time with my boyfriend. Like I’m taking away from his alone time or time he could be doing something more important.

Like he has Thursday and Friday off this week. I went round last night as I often do during the week when he finishes work (I normally see him once after work and then the weekend every week) anyway tomorrow is the anniversary of our first kiss. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know this and probably wouldn’t be that fussed if I told him (not really into soppy stuff) anyway it’s kinda important to me and I want to spend the day with him but in my head I keep thinking “no it’s his first day off leave him alone, don’t ruin him having time to himself” so now idk what to do because I want to see him but feel sad because what if I’m just being selfish?"
Anxiety,I really just wish people were a little more compassionate,I don’t have much else to say. I’m just tired.
Anxiety,"I feel like i’m living in a bad dream, the past two years have brought me nothing but heartache, ANXIETY, depression and bipolar. I desperately need somebody to talk to and help me but with everything going on it’s so hard.","Ever since my ex left me in april of 2019, life has been one shitstorm after the next. The last 4 months have felt like i’m living in a simulation, simply watching life pass me by. And the life that is passing me by is getting worse and worse and less like what i want.

I’m by no means an addict but i am surrounded by a social circle where the norm is to binge drink and take recreational drugs. I’m 25, have a steady job, live at home with my mother still. At some points i feel great and like i have a plan. Low points hit, like this morning, where i got so shitfaced lastnight and completely forgot who i was. I’m now sat in work feeling horrendous and i’m sat here asking myself why i did that.

Is that even me? I don’t want to be that person any more but it’s like i have no self control. My ex broke things off with me a week after terminating her early pregnancy. I cried my eyes out every day 2 months straight. This is when things started to spiral and i would start to throw myself into situations where i could get as fucked up as possible to numb the pain which only caused more issues with my mental. The termination still pains me to my core as i see my friends all getting on with their lives, settling down and having kids. My closest friend of the last 10 years announced he was expecting lastnight and we had a few drinks to celebrate. Something in me subliminally made me take it too far as i hooned up the last line at 2am and stumbled home out of my face.

With everything that’s going on with the pandemic, and my country going into a second lockdown, i feel so lonely and lost in my thoughts. I don’t like the person who i am, who i have been or who i am becoming. Nothing is as i thought i would be. I just want someone to love me and make me feel like i’m not a worthless piece of human garbage. 

The anxiety is crippling. I’m so worried about what my future holds and what my place in this world is. I’m so unhappy with the way things are right now and i simply don’t know where to turn. My mind flickers from this to terrible decisions ive made over the past year, people i have hurt and all the things i have done that can’t be taken back. I don’t know whether to take a step back in distance myself from everyone or reach out to somebody for help.

As i’m writing this i’m worried about what will happen tonight, tomorrow, next week. What happens when this hangover and come down wares off. And i feel okay again and then leap into another booze/drug fuelled nightmare. I feel like lastnight was a wake up call for me that this isn’t the right path that i’m on. That i need to learn some self control. I just feel so fucking broken and empty. I don’t know why this beautiful life has become so horrible and miserable for me.

I have secret anxiety coughing attacks when with friends and we’re going somewhere. We were walking lastnight and i was just at the back coughing away, almost being sick because i’m anxious. What is that? Why am i so unsure of myself and worried about everything. I couldn’t pinpoint what i’m so anxious about, i just am.

I feel like life has just been one let down after another up until this point. I’ve never gotten what i wanted...it’s always been just out of reach. I had a taste of it but it was ripped away from me and now i just fucking hate myself for not being able to hang onto it.

I’m scared, please help."
Anxiety,Started Zoloft Looking for Advice,"Hi all, this is my first time taking any type of antidepressant and I'm looking for advice. 

I was prescribed 25mg of Sertraline. I know people say the first two weeks can be rough and make everything feel worse, but Jesus I am only on Day 2 and feel terrible. 

Soon after taking it I get the lump in throat feeling like something is stuck in there. I know it is not, I can breathe and swallow normally but it is really freaking me out and uncomfortable. 

I'm also getting racing thoughts and everything feels really overwhelming. I have to get up in 20 minutes to get the kiddo ready for school and I feel stuck. 

People who have taken it before what are some things that can help? And does it really get better after this initial hump? Please just remind me it's all in my head. Thank you ❤️"

Anxiety,Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online,"It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/café/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Also, this doubles as a plea to all restaurants- if you didn't alreday do it, I'M BEGGING YOU please post your menus online, whether on your website, your IG story highlights, or in an album on Facebook."
Anxiety,In elementary school when we would have to read out loud to the class from the textbook I would literally count the kids in front of me and figure out what section I was reading so I could practice it before it got to my turn &amp; I think that’s where my anxiety started,
Anxiety,I'm probably getting a job and the anxiety is killing me,"So my dad is friends with a man who works for the local government. He told this man that I'm about to graduate from college which isn't true at all. Because of my anxiety I'm struggling a lot and a 4 year degree is taking me a lot longer. Anyway, this man took interest in me because they need someone who is about to graduate from my career and I'm the only person he knows of (it's a very niche career), so he is coming to my house today to talk to me about my qualifications.

Thanks to my dad who never went to college and doesn't understand how it works, this man thinks I'm like a semester away from graduation, when I'm like at least 2 (3 counting this current semester that ends in three weeks) semesters away from graduation. And because of my anxiety I'm terribly ashamed of my grades, which he wants to see.

I look at the courses I've taken and all I see is all the courses I'm missing. I'm more qualified for this job than most people around me, I'm very passionate about my career, I love it, but I feel unqualified, scared and ashamed to show people the education I have.

I should've graduated two years ago but because of anxiety it's taking me longer than most people. I used to start a class and drop it as soon as things got too difficult and I got too anxious. Now I'm finally able to take exams and get through a semester. Last semester I completed 2 in one (took a bunch of classes to make up for the lost time), this semester I'm doing something similar.

 I am ashamed of myself, the idea of explaining to this man that I'm not as close to graduation as he thinks makes me shake and tear up and my throat closes up and I feel like I'm about to throw up. Ever since my dad (proudly, bless his soul) told me he was ""getting me a job"" I've had a headache and ear pain that won't go away and I feel like crying from so much shame. I feel like a disappointment. I don't know what to do."
Anxiety,I can’t sleep because I feel like I can’t breathe,"Hey guys! So lately I’ve been having really bad anxiety and have been super stressed. I do take meds for depression but it seems like anxiety has sort of crept up on me a few years ago - in my late twenties. I have an appointment with my doc in a few weeks and I do plan to discuss with her.

Anyways, a few months ago I had my first full blown 2 l-hour long panic attack. It was triggered by the fact that I kept feeling like I couldn’t breathe. Now for the past few nights I’ve been having the same feeling, but only just when I start to fall asleep. I lay awake for hours, my mind racing about everything from chores to money to loved ones dying. It’s absurd and no matter what I do I can’t calm down. When I finally start to drift to sleep, I’m awoken by the sensation that I am not breathing. I literally can’t feel myself inhaling. I start to panic but then I realize what’s happening and make myself focus by using my pillow against my nose to feel the air moving (if that makes sense). Then I drift off and same thing! Over and over. I’m getting real tired (pun intended).

I can’t be alone, right?! Anyways, I was just looking to see if anyone has methods and/or ideas for managing anxiety at night. Or even dealing/coping with stress. I always wake up feeling better in the morning, but it’s starting to wear on me and I know it’s terrible for your body. Ugh!

Also, I do play puzzle games and read almost every night to calm myself."
Anxiety,I suck at productivity,"I have to write 2 pages of a literature review for this week and I can’t find the motivation to do it

I haven’t written any scientific papers ever (lab reports don’t count), and I haven’t written an essay since GCSE (2016) and it’s scaring me

The problem is that my anxiety about it is stopping me from doing other things in the meantime, like showering and eating, which is making everything worse

Anxiety,Nocturnal Panic Attacks,I am waking up every night around 1am with panic.. it literally takes my breath away and makes me feel like I am dying. Lasts a good hour and is happening every single night. Anyone have any advice? Open to medication recommendations also!
Anxiety,Everything feels like too much,"I just can't stop having nightmares. I had an anxiety dream last night that i was showing up to a job i don't have at what i thought was an early time only to be told i was 20 minutes late. Then i would try to do a task and i would take too long and be berated for it.
I can't even leave the house most days because the stream of what ifs that go through my head. 
Medication has helped to a degree, but i still get overwhelmed at everything. If i have to do a task, i'll put it off until the very last second. I can't even function at a workplace anymore. Even as I post on here i'm terrified someone I know will see this and try and talk to me about it or think i'm faking it.
I keep having panic attacks weekly, sometimes daily. I just want to feel better.

I'm sorry for the long post, i don't even know what to ask for. I guess i'm just a little lost right now."

Anxiety,Does anyone know why I would need an abdominal ultrasound after blood testing?,"Had missed calls from the hospital and my Gastro right after getting blood tests yesterday. Called this morning and the front desk lady didn’t know anything about my blood test results but I think she didn’t know I didn’t know anything about apparently needing to schedule an abdominal ultrasound/sonogram, which she said is what the nurse might have been calling about? Honestly freaking the hell out waiting for the nurse to come in and call me back. What is this testing used for? I keep seeing stuff about tumors and cancer and also stuff like an enlarged spleen and I’m having a major panic attack. I just need someone to tell me its not as serious as I think it is?"
Anxiety,My worst irrational fear came true and I don’t know how to move on,"Since I was a really little kid I’ve feared windows and my house at night. No clue where it came from, but I’ve been terrified of my windows at night as well as break-ins/men I don’t know being in my house at night. 
It took my entire life, up until leaving for college, to let go of that. Then, about two months ago, my neighbor with Alzheimer’s started to look through my windows and /try/ to enter my house at night. 
I emphasize, but honestly and selfishly it is putting my mental health in the gutter.  
I can no longer pass by any windows at night. I have cats who sometimes pull my curtains down so I nailed all of the curtains to the window sills. Plus a blanket cover for each so it’s impossible to see through. 
But I’m still have panic attacks at night when I have to use the bathroom or want a snack. 

TLDR: scared of men looking through my window since I was a child, that happened but reasonably, can’t move on."

My GP knows I've got severe depression and anxiety but because I keep feeling tired, she asked me to go for a blood test - however thinking about it, the tiredness is likely because of depression and the drugs I’m on not working. That’s another story - but I don’t think I need it as I’ve nearly resolved the tired thing. 

However, I literally cannot bring myself to go because I’m nervous of passing out or having a panic attack in the waiting room (it’s walk-in). But then I think ‘Jesus, it’s just a blood test, just go!’ 

My anxiety is doing cartwheels in my mind and I feel physically sick. It’s made worse by me thinking I’m sort of abject failure by being this anxious, having the phobia and being too scared to go - as well as if my doctor will think my anxiety/depression is a lie because I don’t want to get a blood test and what on Earth do I say to her about not going. This is then impacting my day job because I can’t concentrate at all because of the massive anxiety and keep staring at the request forms sitting on my desk thinking ‘holy shit why are you so afraid?’ 

I’ve had a blood test before in the emergency bit of the hospital many years ago - and I hated it. Got through it but that was one vial to be drawn whereas this is three. 

Any tips on how to calm the anxiety down? I’m not going for the test as a) I don’t think it’s needed as the reason for it is no longer there and b) the city I’m in is technically going to be in a lockdown so don’t want to risk going to a rather busy facility unless I really need to. But even though I’ve decided I’m not going, the anxiety is killing me..."
Anxiety,Panic Attacks and the feeling of being trapped in your head. Please read this.,"Hey guys, 2 months back I had my first panic attack, which transformed into a full day of panic attacks and anxiety which landed me in the hospital as I thought I was dying. The following weeks I had some dissociation symptoms from this traumatic event. I´m finally feeling like myself more and more again. All I got left is my memory of what happened to me and it´s kind of crippling me to move forward. 

However what´s bothering me is that everytime I watch a movie for example I can´t fully concentrate on it as I´m constantly analyzing my attention span and think about how I can´t let go of what happened and in reality, this is the thing, that is holding me back to pay attention. Same when I´m with friends. I feel good whenever I´m around them and can share some really nice moments and emotions with them but most of the time my head goes: ""Why can´t you let go?"", ""Get out of you head"", ""I just want to forget what has happened to feel like I´m in the moment again"". But these thoughts are the only thing keeping me away from being in the moment, you know? Sounds very paradox, but I thought maybe you could understand what I´m saying. 

I feel kind of trapped in my head and in a constant loop of thoughts but the loop´s only content is that I am feeling trapped in a loop of thought and can´t be in the moment and like I said these thoughts are the only thing that keep me from being in the moment. Like I can´t let my thoughts just be there as before but kind of want to take control of them, even tho whenever I do it, my thoughts turn against me and push me further away from the moment. 

I guess my biggest problem is just that I want to make myself forget about all of these things, which is not possible, as I can‘t forget about it as long as I‘m still thinking about it haha. 

I also have that weird feeling that I can‘t ever get fully over it as everything in my life will constantly remind you of all of these things. Like I wanna move on but can‘t because once I was in this overthinking state for a few months, everything around me or just songs, movies and everything I once loved got connected to all of these feelings and thoughts and they will constantly remind me of my past. All of this is such a weird experience really.

I hope you got any idea of what I´m saying. I know probably all of this sounds not so bad, but it‘s really fucking me up. I feel like I‘m so dumb because of this as I can‘t get out of my head and think about anything external really and I‘m afraid that this will keep me from going to university or getting a good job later on as I just can‘t pay attention. It‘s really crippling me and making me depressed from time to time. Not to sound arrogant, but I always was a smart boy before this and now I‘m so afraid that I won‘t be able to use my abilities for good as I‘m trapped in my head forever.

I just wanna go back to the person I was 2 months ago, I wasn‘t even like a super happy person or anything like that but at least I didn‘t feel so lost in my head and not everyday felt the same, with the same thoughts going through my head day in and day out. I feel so dumb for knowing what my problem is but just not being able to let go. 

Do you have any tips for me on how to overcome this? Or did anyone of you had a similar situation going on? 

Anyway, have a good day, people. I wish you the best :)"
Anxiety,ANXIETY HEADACHES,"I have been on 10 mgs for 3.5 weeks and still have high anxiety, decreased libido, headaches and tiredness. I have chronic tension headaches with all the anxiety for 7 months. Anyone have anything similar and does the medicine start to help for the anxiety, maybe I need to go to 15 to 20 mgs.?"
Anxiety,"How to respond to ""what do you need"" questions?","Hi everyone, I have been struggling lately with just overall constant worry, anxiety, and the ""doom"" feeling. I'm not entirely sure what is making it more intense than my already-intense ""normal"" state, but I just can't shake the intensity over the past few days. I regularly talk to my boyfriend about how I'm feeling and he's very supportive. However, I've been noticing a real flaw in myself recently when he asks what I need or how he can help. I just say ""I don't know."" There is not a single thing I can imagine that would help and I so much appreciate his support, but I know it gets tiring for him to constantly listen and ask to help me and get that in response. It's like my brain turns off (aside from the anxious part) and I don't remember what I like, what makes me happy, etc. It's so frustrating.

I guess my question for anyone who reads this is what do you say or feel when someone asks you how they can help? Of course just being there helps a bit, but is there anything that you've found productive if someone else is offering to give their time to you to aid in helping your anxiety? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!! Thank you :)"
Anxiety,My therapist mentioned anxiety medication today and I’m crying.,"My therapist mentioned anxiety medication today and I’m crying.

I’m 22 and for as long as I can remember I haven’t really felt things. In my life, decisions are hard to make, when u have anxiety basically anxiety turns off your logical mind. Since I have a decently high level of anxiety it’s turned off a lot and it can make it really hard for me to think and I always feel stressed from the moment I wake up till I go to bed. It’s been for this for a kinda long time now.

In therapy my therapist often ask me how I feel and to put words on my emotions. But I just cant.. I zone out a lot as well due to anxiety.

I’m on my way home atm from my therapist and I know once I get inside I’ll break down crying. 

I just wanna be normal, normal as not needing medication and feeling fine. (Who doesn’t)

I asked if it’s the only way, but he said there’s things still to try. Even if the logical thing is to try that first and if it doesn’t work out go on medication, I just don’t want to even tho I know it is the right thing to do if so.

I don’t know.. I feel low right now after he mentioned it, makes me realise how “sick” I might actually be.
*crying*

My hopes are that if I can manage to make some friends or and get a relationship (not wanting to rely on a boyfriend, but rather having one to share experiences/feel loved/love. I guess...) my life will become better and help me.
I haven’t had a friend since I was 18. I been isolating when not working and playing games.

Any input is appreciated."
Anxiety,Reduced anxiety from taking mushrooms,"I was diagnosed with GAD 8 years ago but have always suffered from it since I was young. It's taken a lot of time but with therapy and medication, it's gotten a lot better from where it was. However, over the last couple weeks, I found myself having more anxiety leading to depressive symptoms as well. About a week ago, I decided to take mushrooms just for the experience. I'm not really a recreational drug user but it's always something I wanted to try. 

The trip was mesmerizing. I remember just sitting there and seeing a water bottle expand in size and then shrink. I remember just seeing things more vividly and watching the new Borat movie was amazing as well. There were sometimes I was thinking about past memories and bad thoughts about myself started creeping in. I came down and eventually went to sleep. 

When I woke up the next morning, I felt alive and energized. It was weird given how I'd been feeling recently. Since then, my anxiety has greatly reduced and I just feel at peace. I usually wake up in the morning with a sense of dread but ever since then, I haven't.

Has anyone had similar experience with this?"
Anxiety,I think my fiancé just wants excuse to leave me,Today my fiancé told me he wants small wedding rather than big one. It was ok with me. We want to organize it in my country and not his now. Anyway he said he invited his family too but he requested to me that my family should give him 1K for his relative because he ran out of cash for the wedding and his parents flight. What is odd he told me if we can find way for the 1K he will break up. He said the wedding was already delayed with months and he wants real relationship now. If he didn't had enough money he should have saved from something else I am beyond hurt. I am not sure if my family would like to spare anything Amyway In the morning we had fought for something else and he said he is extremely mad. Can this be the result for his words. Thoughts

Anxiety,dae imagine they’re being watched by people?,"idk if this is classified as anxiety but i figured it was the closest

literally ever since i was a kid i’ve compulsively imagined i was being watched by random people like my peers or friends or celebrities even where basically i just imagine they’re invisible and watching everything i do (i know there’s no one actually there) and imagine how they’d react to every little thing i do and basically adjust my personality depending on the person i imagine is watching me. for example if i imagine one of my friends is watching me and they hate the tv show i’m watching i change it to something i know they’d like even if i hate it cuz it makes me uncomfortable to think they’d have a negative opinion about me (even though ik they’re not actually there)

it’s gotten a point recently where if i’m watching a tv show and i’m not wearing like a full face of makeup with my hair done i start imagining the actors are watching me thinking things like “this is the kind of ugly person that watches my show?” or something and i literally will have to turn off the show cuz i get so uncomfortable and i just realized i used tv shows for both examples but it can happen with anything like the food i eat or the music i listen to or how i talk

obviously every time it happens i try to get it out of my head but i kinda normally just have to wait it out i feel like there’s nothing i can do to prevent it and it’s really annoying"

Anxiety,COVID Anxiety,"My COVID anxiety is ruining my life. Even now, I feel a tightness in my chest. I google my symptoms daily, even though I already know all of them by heart. My health anxiety was already very bad before this, due to a bad immune system and 3 months of strep. About a month back I got bronchitis, I was having a hard time breathing, the sickest I’ve been in years. This created a whole new realm of anxiety I hadn’t experienced yet: breathing anxiety. 

I will convince myself that the smallest cough or irritation is COVID. I will spiral myself into a panic attack, convince myself that I have a stuffy nose or that I can’t breathe the same way I usually can. I’m currently on day 3 of a panic attack. It ebbs and flows, but remains. I’ll have 30 minutes of heart racing, mind boggling, chest tightening, fear. 5 minutes of calm. With good normal breathing, no chest tightness. And then? I start to panic again. That I won’t be able to breathe. That I can’t breathe. My poor boyfriend has been a rock through this. He’s doing a wonderful job of convincing me that I am in fact fine and distracting me from my thoughts. But god, I feel like such a burden because I can’t seem to get my anxiety under control. 

I need help. I need advice. I need to go through a day without hyperventilating and crying because I feel like I can’t breathe. If anyone has any advice, is going through the same thing, please let me know. I don’t know what to do anymore."

Anxiety,Physical symptoms v. actual illness,"Hi, I could use a little bit of assistance.  My anxiety tends to manifest as an upset stomach, complete with cramping, hot and cold flashes, and all the other one-run trappings of a stomach bug. This has resulted in me not always being able to tell what's anxiety, and what's an actual upset stomach from eating something that didn't agree with me or coming down with some sort of illness. Does anyone else who experiences this know how to differentiate?  I don't want to overmedicate with things like pepto bismol or tums if it's just anxiety, but I also am pretty tired of dealing with this nonsense. Any help would be appreciated"
Anxiety,Do I need a therapist or a doctor will do?,"Hi! I'm sorry about the title as it could be misleading, but I couldn't find a better one.
I have this 'little' problem that I don't know what to do about, it's about a bladder problem, so kinda started a few years ago in winter, when I came back from school (PE to be exact) I went to wash my hands, and without even feeling the need to pee, I peed myself, I didn't think anything of it, but the next year it also happened, the same way as last year, after pe ,washing my hands and Bam, so this happened 1/2 times in a year, but then the big problem happened, and it was that after getting out of the bathroom, it happened as well, I didn't even feel the need to pee so I don't understand why, it developed this fear in me that I might pee myself, at first it was just near water, and it didnt bother my everyday life like sleeping and studying, but then this year it got worse, I was worried all the time, near water, after drinking water, even going to sleep, and thinking about peeing make me have a feeling I might pee myself and makes me go running to the bathroom, I had to distract myself from thinking about it ( usually by singing a song in my head), but it was fine because I didn't have to go anywhere,I didn't have school because of quarantine,so I just stayed inside for the whole 8 months, but now I can't, because school reopened and I have to get out of my comfort zone and move around, where there is no bathroom near me (because our school is shitty and doesn't even have a proper bathroom, it's utterly filthy), today is the first day, it was okay in the morning because they sent us home, but in the afternoon, I was sitting on my chair, there was no teacher around and we had to wait inside class, when all of a sudden, I felt like I need to pee,I didn't know what to do, I felt my legs shaking, I was stressing, I was almost in tears, I stood up awkwardly to check if I really have to, but sat down quickly because I was too scared, it felt like I will pee myself any moment, when someone came and told us we can go home because we don't have classes today, I got up as soon as they left and started walking home, and guess what, that feeling left as I was nearing home, I didn't tell anyone about this, but my mom knows about the accidents and told me it was fine and that this happens to most people especially females in winter ( I'm a female), and that it was only because of my period ( which I think is kinda true because these accidents happened a few days before my period), but she doesn't know about my fear and stress, and I'm worried this fear will make me unable to focus on my studies and school, and will ruin my everyday life, is this really going to be my life from now on?

What I am now asking is, will going to the doctor and getting a check up on my bladder help or is this fear related to anxiety and has nothing to do with the health of my bladder?

I'm very sorry about the long post."
Anxiety,I think I’m sabotaging myself HELP,"I have issueswith avoiding things when I’m scared or nervous about what will happen - even though that makes the problem worse. 

Im a senior and i work part time. Both in And out of school I avoid things, procrastinate if its a really big project. I always get easy homework / projects/emails out of the way asap. But if its something bigger or an email that requires more explanation, i get nervous about the response and what the other person will think and i always think they’ll be mad at me - which they are not at the time - they DO get mad understandably when I dont respond for a week+. 

I recently messed up in communicating with my manager at work about my sick leave. I was out for a week and genuinley thought i sent an email updating him about returning to work  and doctors clearance (which we now need when returning to work with any illness because of Covid). He called me very annoyed today because its been 5 days without any communication - then i realized i never sent the email - which had taken me 2 days to write btw).  I was planning on asking him for a reccomendation letter in a few months for grad school but i think that Is out of the question now. 

I do the same thing with school - i avoid responding to my professors emails when its something more pressing/ about an assignment or if i request an extension. I will literally get so anxious about even opening my email app to see their name. I just logged in for the first time in a week to see 2 emails from a professor about an assignment i had missed.

Honestly - im worried and freaking myself out. Im lucky i even still have a job , but more than that im still worried that everyone hates me - which at this point they probably do

tldr. I feel sick all the time, i get anxious about how people will respond, i avoid communication until its so bad that it blows up in my face."

All yesterday and today I've been on edge and having more panic attacks and anxiety attacks than normal. Doesn't help that my family was visiting and left late last night so I'm feeling the residual emptiness that's left from their absence.

I keep worrying about my circumstances and what might change if X gets elected. I keep thinking of all my friends and family who fully support X candidate and it makes me nauseous. I've had 2 seizures from stress in the last 24 hrs (I have epilepsy) and I'm riding a fucking rollercoaster of emotions.

All that being said, we all just need to remember that our country and society is ever changing. We're always moving towards a bigger picture and usually the ethical side wins one way or another. Supporters on both sides have reasons they think are justified and it doesn't make them shitty people. We're all trying to survive and we'll get through it together. Maybe we'll see another wave of young protestors pushing for change. Who knows. 

After all this is over we won't judge based on what person someone voted for. We'll judge if they're a shitty person regardless of how that trait manifests. 

Keep breathing. This will be over soon enough. In the meantime do some self-care today. I'm gonna do we yoga, meditate, write in my journal, go for a walk and maybe read a book at the park. What are you going to do today to take care of yourself?"
Anxiety,Free and easy to use mental health resources I’ve found useful for anxiety,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/) \- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety."

Anxiety,I need help with deciding if I should change schools :/,"So I’m 14 and live in London and I attend secondary school.

For my first year,I attended one about a mile away,which I’ll call C-school since the area it’s located starts with a c.The school I’m at now,I’ll call P-School for the same reason.

So C-School I attended for almost a year.I had made quite a lot of really good friends and I was quite happy.The downside is the uniform-we have to wear grey and pink blazers and us girls are only allowed to wear trousers.We have to use the plain black school backpacks and were not allowed makeup or hair accessories.I’ll have to take two busses to get there too.But to be honest,my best friend who I talk to everyday attends it and I love him a lot,I don’t talk to my other friends too much but we keep in touch on social media and before I left we were very close.We had a lot of fun and the teachers were quite alright,I learned a lot and there weren’t a lot of disruptions.We dont get any non-uniform days but idrm.

P-School,I started I think,July last year.I finished year 7 there and i was pretty popular off the bat.I remember my first day where I was being shown one of the playgrounds and I got stuck at the necked since the whole courtyard had gathered around me to look.People were standing on benches and stuff and it was pretty scary.After that,I made a few friends and sort of went through the most ions.I never really settled in and after almost two years,I still feel new.I still feel sick to my stomach the night before and on the way to school like it’s my first day.I don’t think I’ve really learned anything,mostly because the teachers have to spend the whole hour trying to get unruly kids into their seats and they flat out refuse to cooperate.They smash chairs against the walls,smoke,do weed,ditch class in the toilets and climb on tables.They throw paper around and have water fights.This means they have to strip down in the middle of class and hang their shirts and skirts out the window.I’m not allowed to choose my language class,I don’t get any work done and the teachers care about makeup than our safety.There’s regular stabbings at the bus stop I walk past and the teachers make me uncomfortable.I don’t have any friends since quarantine put me in a severe depressive state where I stopped talking to everyone.Then during my sensors week back my best friends spread rumours about me which gave me a panic attack and made me cry.I have to sit next to here in most my classes and I don’t really talk to anyone else.I find it so,so hard to talk to people.Even a girl I know said recently that ‘I still feel new’.The plus of this school is the uniform regulations aren’t as strict,it takes me about two minutes to walk there and we get regular non uniform days and late starts.It’s an older building and looks nicer,and it isn’t on a main road.

I mainly don’t want to be a bother to my mum.I just got new uniform and pe kit,and I don’t have my old uniform.I feel so selfish for changing all the time and I don’t want to make my mum pay for my uniform.

I don’t know what to do.I’m genuinely about to cry because I’m supposed to go into school tomorrow and I have food tech .In that class I sit next to my ex best friend and I don’t know anyone else and I can’t bring myself to talk to her after what she did.I’m so scared and I feel like throwing up.I don’t know who I’ll hang out with at break or walk to lunch with.I’m so scared.Please,please help.I don’t know what to do.

I had no clue what was really keeping me up last night since I ended my night with some random happy videos. That was until I woke up and realized the first thing I wanted to do was check the results. To no surprise, it's still inconclusive which means I might be in for another night of restlessness.

Anxiety,I feel like I'm falling apart and I have no one to turn to.,"I started taking Lexapro recently to treat my GAD, and its been okay for a couple weeks but last night I woke up a lot completely panicked, my thoughts were jumbled and I felt like I was losing my mind. I've been so tired this morning and feel like I have this huge weight on top of me, I feel so sad and scared. My boyfriend is usually really supportive, but he's traveling for work and when I try to talk about how I'm feeling it just seems to turn into a fight where it feels like he just thinks I'm acting this way to make him feel bad. If something he does or says upsets me, even if it's completely unintentional on his part, he just says ""okay im sorry, ill do better"" thats it. It doesn't really feel like he tries to understand. He's having a really hard time lately and he feels too much pressure from me at times like this, I don't think he has the emotional capacity to fully support me right now. I feel really bad for him and wish I could just be fine and not put unnecessary strain on our relationship. 

The only other person I could talk to is my best friend but she's taking care of her mother who's going to pass away any day now, all while still working on her PhD. I can't bring myself to complain to her about my problems. So I have no one at the moment. I keep breaking out into tears and feeling so sad and anxious while I'm at work, and I wanna go home but I'm honestly so afraid to be alone. I have to figure out how to be okay and get through this on my own. 

All I can do is try to hold on and hope tomorrow is a better day. How are you guys doing? Today is probably stressful for a lot of people, so I guess at least I'm not alone in that."
Anxiety,My whole life I have been listening to my parents fighting,"I am 18 and my whole life I have listened to them fighting, constant screaming, my mother crying, even when I was in her stomach she was taking some pills to relief stress. He even choked her in the car once.

We were poor in the 2000s and my mother worked 2 jobs while my father took all of her money, she used to walk from one part of the town to the other and he still wanted more.

This year, my mother found out that she has a autoimmune disease and stopped working her second job, because her hands hurt too much. 

Now they fight almost every day, he drinks, he acts like a kid and mentions things that have been before they were even together(which was 20 years ago), her boyfriends before him, 4 days ago they fought and yelled at my aunts house, he was dead drunk.

They fought today again and it really gives me stress, I had to tell this to someone."
Anxiety,Grocery store anxiety,"I talked myself through my anxieties, and went shopping alone.

Instead of being all cranked up with fear about COVID, I wore my mask and social distanced. I did my best to follow the rules, and let go of worrying about what anyone else is doing. Sometimes people got too close, but I accepted that I can't always control things.

I thought through my social anxieties. I thought about how unlikely they are, and how they don't matter to me. The main goal was to get food for my family, and that was something I could definitely do.

I've realized that I've been tense for a while. I'm making an effort to be aware of that tension level. I'm realizing that I don't need to be so wound up.

I'm trying to see others in a more positive light. I'm trying to forgive more. I know that when I treat others more kindly, I start to do the same toward myself."

Anxiety,Health anxiety,"Heart problem or anxiety!!!!?

Is it just anxiety or heart problem?

Hello i’m 21 male and its been like a year now i’m having heart problems and anxiety about it .
Its started a year ago i had  exams and some other problems that mad me anxious and stressed. I was having digestif problems and feeling my heart racing and also chest pain and in one night i had very bad thoughts and i couldn’t sleep cause i was thinking i’ gonna die if i do. In the next day i went to cardiologist and done all the blood and heart test he told me all test was ok and my heart was ok but i have high blood pressure and fast heart rate but he couldn’t know the cause cause all the tests were okay , he gave me medication for high blood pressure i took it for a months and then stoped cause my anxiety and stress went away and also all the other problems went away. 
And lately with the lockdown ,exams and family problems my anxiety came back and i started overthinking this time it came with headaches and  heart pain. 
What do uu think guys ? I feel the heart pain more when i’m lying down and more at night when i sleep on my side i went to doc again and told my heart is okay !!
The problem is i trust the bad thought more than the doc and that makes me sick !!!!"
Anxiety,Road test for driver’s license in 4 hours and I’m freaking out already.,"
My heart’s racing, my head’s just about to explode. I can’t stop fidgeting or shaking. I’m scared I might freak out during the test and fail.

This isn’t my first time taking the test, I’ve already got my license in my home country - I passed the test the first time around. I’ve relocated since then, so I just need to get tested here so I can get a local license to actually drive around here. I don’t know what to do. :("

Anxiety,What’s been your experience with SSRIs/antidepressants?,I’ve been in therapy for almost four years and trying to manage my anxiety without medication. The pandemic has caused me to regress and I’m at a point where it might be time to add medications to my treatment plan. The bad news: *this terrifies me*! The idea of having to experience heightened anxiety (for weeks?) as your body adjusts to the medicine has held be back for years. What’s been your personal experience with SSRIs?
Anxiety,I've been on edge for the last couple days,"Yesterday I wasn't hearing much from my girlfriend, which is unlike her, and that was causing to me worry in case something was wrong (e.g. she was upset or something happened to her) and it sent me into a spiral of anxiety and I kept thinking of all the worst possibilities. Then I had to run out to a store and collect a few things and I remember they had a sign in-store saying the checkouts were on the left and the exit was on the right. I look to the right and there's an exit gate, literally a cage door and I panic. Am I suppose to go through it? Does the staff nearby let me through? What if it's locked and I look like an idiot? All these thoughts rush through my head and I'm aware of how worried I've become, and as soon as I go past the gate I walk as quickly to the exit doors as I can.

Eventually I got talking to her over a video call and told her and we talked about it and everything was alright. I was actually worried about telling her in case she acted badly (I'm used to irrational bad reactions like that) and had myself convinced she'd be annoyed at me, but it was the complete opposite.

Today I felt mostly fine, I went to the gym and thought about the anxious feeling I had yesterday and used that and the heavy music I was listening to to get me through my workout. Later on today I had to drive out to a part of the city I'm unfamiliar with and because I couldn't find the address I was looking for got myself into a panic, which is unlike me. If I stalled the car after trying to take off too quickly I'd verbally freak out (cursing to myself). I find the address eventually and noticed as I approaching that I was almost shaking with fear and got that weird feeling throughout my body, where you almost can't feel your own body.

It took me a little while to feel calm again, since I was panicking so much and my body was in fight or flight mode. I've no idea what caused me to feel so worried, usually I don't get anxious"

Anxiety,Working through lockdown,"With England back in lockdown from tomorrow, the company I work for (non essential retail) has found a loophole that means its shops are allowed to stay fully open. Not just click and collect but open completely as normal. And for us that will mean busy as hell.

I’m not even sure what to do with all this anxious and tbh angry energy I’ve got. I’m so worried and upset I can’t focus on anything else I need to do. Cases and deaths are on the rise and I have to go to work every day in a PANDEMIC to sell people luxury goods they DON’T NEED. And I can’t complain at work because that goes against the company ethos of happiness. 

I know pandemic anxiety is rife and there’s so much worse going on. But I am really dreading going to work tomorrow."
Anxiety,Foot and Palms sweating out of nowhere and random Night Sweats,I have been having serious anxiety over the past 2 months. I have had a range of symptoms regarding anxiety. One that has been been recently bothering me is sweat. Now I could just be sitting at work at my desk and I start to sweat from my palms and feet. I wont even have an anxiety trigger just calmly sitting there then I notice the sweat and I start to fear the sweat which then makes me keep sweating. I wondering if any of you experience this same situation? I keep looking online and things start to scare me like cancer and illness which I dont think I have. Im a skinny guy and I normally barely sweat much. I also have been having night sweats off and on the past month. Have any of you experience night sweats and these random day sweats at the same time? I feel like im going crazy thinking about this. Thanks
Anxiety,Brand new t-shirt,"This is probably going to get buried on this subreddit but whatever.

A few weeks ago, I ordered this cool yellow t-shirt with a Chinese dragon on it. It's almost identical to the flag of the Qing Dynasty. If you're a history buff like me you'll know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, I've only worn the shirt two or three times since it arrived, but today I put it on because I was in the mood to wear it. 

Later, actually about thirty minutes ago, I sat down to do some work and I pinned it between myself and my chair in way that was uncomfortable so I pulled at the collar and I think it kind of stretched the collar. As if this wasn't bad enough, I kept looking at my collar to check if I had stretched it which probably only made it worse. I ended up just putting on a different shirt.

Maybe the shirt isn't as stretched out as I think it is, but it's hard to tell. I feel like such an idiot. Who the hell stretches a shirt after only a few days of wearing it (nonconsecutively). My mom says it isn't a big deal and she might be able to fix it but I feel like a clumsy fool. I don't feel like being nice to myself right now. I don't deserve it."

Anxiety,"what are your ""wait, that's an anxiety thing!?"" stories?","probably a million prompts like this one, but i'm interested and wouldn't know how to find an older post like this. 

my example: i remember very clearly (before i understood that my ""normal"" was actually really anxious compared to everyone else's standards) feeling kind of numb when things were going on. ""things"" usually means my family being loud, as i didn't even notice this kind of thing in school because i was already pretty quiet and unresponsive. i don't think i was even aware that i would be stressed out. a little anticlimactic, but the time in particular that i think back on a bit was this one moment when my step-mom had just come home from the grocery store. she was in the garage, and my siblings were being loud, doing *something*, i don't know. my dad was angry at them or possibly just stressed, so he was yelling. he told me to help my step-mom with the groceries. my step-mom herself is and was a huge stressor, and never before have i suddenly felt so paralysed. i just remember staring at him like an idiot and gritting out, ""i can't."" 

he was obviously like, ""what do you mean, you *can't*?""

i just sort of floundered, and i recall so clearly being unable to do anything more than stutter and make weird noises. i think i kind of turned and looked away or something, but the moment was too quick in the chaos of my step-mom coming inside and children yelling and my dad directing them. i didn't end up helping her, i don't think, but it was fine because she had it handled. 

i never thought much of it or understood why that happened until much later.

i'm not sure why such an insignificant (and certainly minor, compared to others) incident sticks out so much, but maybe it was because i very rarely have been disobedient or directly unresponsive. my entire childhood was spent alone in my room 90% of the time, or at school where you can disappear into the crowds, so the opportunity for my anxiety to act like over-powering animal instincts to *run away* is uncommon. 

i'm sure i have more interesting stories or little tendencies that can be explained by GAD or social anxiety, but i forget them all now. what about u guys?"
Anxiety,Having one of those days where I feel completely unsettled for no identifiable reason.,"I handled yesterday remarkably better than I expected to considering it was Election Day. I had trouble getting to sleep last night and then woke up and immediately started feeling anxious today. 

I’m going to go take a walk in a little bit when I finish my next chunk of work. Hoping that will help!

Thanks for listening. It helps me to be able to express how I’m feeling, in a safe place."
Anxiety,Can somebody please hear me out and calm me? Ex-friend contacted.,"Hello friend, i really hope this is a safe space. This is a very detailed story but if you read it and give me advice on moving on or just some really simple support it’d help alot. This is a very traumatic experience and i realy need someone to listen.

There was a person online i had known for a while and this was some years ago. The ‘friendship’ ended when i blocked them. They made me paranoid. Im even all fucked up writing this scared that because i show my fears they get what they want, even if this is a private account. 

Ive barely cried hard in my life or let alone get sad by a person. But this person used to make life so i had to sob with my voice on full volume to get something out. For me, crying like that happened twice so far. Living felt like the creepiest simulation. A chapter in life too defined for words. 

I used to be scared of every corner
And right now i’m again kind of feeling like that.

They really scared me with an ‘alternative’ personality. 

Because of this person i hate social media even more. 

Whenever i get a 1 at my messages i had been scared for a while, it went away for a few months finally, and now the person contacted me.

Accusing me of having tried to contact them with an account that was not me. 

Another ex friend that was still friends with them had given my account to them to talk to me. In my opinion, that’s fucked.

I got a whole message
I’ll copy and paste it and make it short.

I’m sure you’ll read this. 
I am gonna promise not to hurt you. never my intent. 
But could you please stop trying to contact me with the account on YouTube. I want to make a fresh start.
Im a completely different person than that. Im gonna be blocked. and I'm never gonna get the chance to say this without you getting angy, but I apologize for everything... I've been responsible and went to get help to get my health back to get rid of it worked after 2 years.. it wasn't thanks to you. Absolutely not. you made it even worse. I'm glad you have been my friend.. your probably gonna block me. And I won't have the chance to even show any of you that I have changed.. but.. if you guys want to do such cruel thing.. I'll believe that. And I will be okay with it. Your guy's cruelty made me stronger and believe in myself. So.. thank you for breaking me as a person.



I’ve always been trying my best to teach people kindness even with my friends at the time. This person tells me they are the stronger person by contacting me? They also said they wanted a second chance. I responded as normal as ever, and to mention, i had never really gotten mad in the past at stuff like this?

As you might be able to see with the dot usage etc this is a bit manipulative, and i’m really not gonna bother, but my anxiety does not like this at all.

I have feelings of chapters in life i guess? And being forcefully pulled back to such an old chapter in life makes me feel emprisoned and feel like my happy future is too far. I asociate times in my life with some kind of mental smell or a feeling in my stumach, and feel so hopeless being pulled back into such a negative one. I’ce always been done with social media but now i’m fully done. That’s ok. I know i deserve better :). I just really want this person to forget me now, and stop trying to contact and stalk me. 
My past few years have been really really rough. This message didn’t help. 

I answered very plainly. I told her i read all that, and it’s not me. And that i genuinly had no intent of wanting to contact you, and for them to please not contact me.

They didn’t believe me and kept trying to speak about it. Even said that other ex friend somehow confirmed it was me? 

(While it seriously was not?)

They said it’s them and not their odd split personality they just want to fix things

But me, knowing it’s and had been better if nobody contacted, said i dont care, and that u wasn’t contacting.

They told me i was harsh

I said it was only the truth.

They said ‘you must be panicking right now’ 

I said why would i be?

Because you always used to, she said.

I said people changge

They said they thought i was scared of them, and that they wanted to contact if people ‘really change’ it should be for the good and start again and start something beautiful.

She did this multiple times in the past few years with me going through with the proposal regardless of the extreme anxiety feel. Always went wrong.
Am i supposed to hurt myself? Ignore my gut? Going back in the past? I don’t want to. I refuse.

They told me they wanted to try again
Told me some stuff like ‘i’ll do my best i promise’

And i said

I apologize, i’d rather not

They said ‘as expected’, ‘guess its a goodbye again.

It was nice.. to have known you... and.. I am seeing that you don't care at all.. thats okay.. I understand.. its a shame.. as my good buddy would say.. only fools.. would push people away who make mistakes.. as I did not get an apology.. from you guys shit talking behind my back. Making a chat where you would laugh at me and humiliate me is interesting. People change. But not all of us change for the good. As noticed. Goodbye. I hope you change for the better at one point aswell.


Now i’ll agree we made a chat for one singular day, but i never made fun of the person. No one did. We were all manipulated and scared trying to find solutions on how to deal with the situation. Getting threats etc isnt nice to experience with no one to talk to, so i’m not sure how to handle it. The groupchat was ment for helping eachother and realizing the manipulative abusive patterns he had and make eachother have a better mood. It wasn’t any harm so far.

This is a really bad experience. You know the type of anxiety attack youd have wanting to pull your hair out and trying to flex your stumach muscles trying to calm your stumach from the anxiety, only making it worse? Sweating but being cold in an extremely warm environment. So even if the making fun of was something that happened, it’s not something you would and should feel bad for...."

Anxiety,16 SIGNS HE LIKES YOU MORE THAN YOU THINK,"**He teases you playfully**

This is often the case when a man likes a girl. He can tell jokes, get nervous, and make her laugh. The main thing is that he tries to make you laugh. He should never be mean or hurtful. If he likes you, the last thing he wants is to make you angry or hurt you.

**He asks you about your love life**

He will ask you if you are with someone, what status you have, and how someone like you can stay single. These questions will show that he is trying to find out if he has a chance with you. He will not necessarily ask if he is not interested.

Anxiety,Anxiety and PTSD triggered,"Feeling lost. I realized that being a lead teacher is not for me. It’s what I thought I was supposed to be doing with my life and now I realize that I can’t handle the pressures and responsibilities that come with being in a lead position. It triggered my anxiety and PTSD and put me in a bad place. I wasn’t eating or sleeping from stress. I was waking up sick to my stomach shaking and crying. I had to resign after a month. Now I’m subbing and trying to figure out what to do with my life. I think I would like to be a teaching assistant or some kind of position behind the scenes. I just feel so bad. I didn’t think getting this position would cause such pain and terror but it did. I had to leave for my mental health. It wasn’t an easy decision. Now I just feel like my life has been a lie. I thought being a lead teacher was it. I couldn’t have been more wrong.  I’m so sad. I feel so horrible about myself but I also know that I couldn’t sustain being in that position a day longer. 

Just wanted to vent. Trying to pick up the pieces of my life and figure out what to do now. Wish me luck 😞"

Anxiety,How to combat general disinterested in things most people enjoy?,"Not trying to sound like an edge lord. But I'm very much a home-body that likes to be alone or working. People drain me. I'd like to change that about myself for the sake of other people on my life that invite me out to do things.

Just for example, my girlfriend wanted me to come with her to a bar she likes. But I'm not really a drinker. I know nothing about drafts or alcohol. I also grew up in a house of substance abuse and alcoholism. So my tolerance for people getting a little wild or faced is really low and I have a lot of distrust of people in general.

I also took my sister to the lake to cool off a few months ago. And I've noticed I throw in the towel really quickly with certain things. Like if a beach is just semi-occupied by other people I am so tempted to say ""fuck this. I'm going home."" But that's not really a practical attitude to have around other people who aren't bothered by crowds. So if like to change that about myself.

I have no issues talking to people if I'm the one asking the questions. And I am genuinely interested in people. But when someone naturally asks me what I do for a living or something about me, I feel this really deep-seated feeling of needing keeping answers as short as possible and avoid over-sharing. I am not exactly sure what that is about entirely but I feel irritated with personal questions. I don't really enjoy talking about myself. It always feels like I'm having to justify my life instead of explaining. I don't think it's their fault. But id also like to change that.


I'm seeing a therapist. But it's hard to explain exactly what I am meaning to her sometimes. And its easier to write. 


Thank you for taking the time to read this."
Anxiety,"""pretending"" to have other disorders??","I've suffered with anxiety pretty much my whole life, and I started having anxiety attacks and panic attacks when I was maybe 13. Paranoia about being the victim of a drive by shooting, or fear that my food is poisoned, etc. But in the last year or two, I became obsessed with the idea of having a different mental illness. So much so that I started ""mimicking"" them and like ""trying them on"" or whatever. Pretty soon everything I did or said or felt, I would relate back to the idea of having a mental illness (other than anxiety) I suffer from aura and seizures, though I haven't been diagnosed with epilepsy, and every time I start to see lights, I think ""oh god I'm hallucinating."" I stay up all night being hyper and it makes me obsess over the idea of having mania/bipolar. I get obsessed with depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, OCD, etc. The thing is, I act these things out even when I don't REALLY ""want"" them to happen. I just cycle through these obsessions. I have become very scared of becoming schizophrenic, but I still obsess over the idea of it regardless, and it causes me to panic. I recently ""mimicked"" psychotic disorders by pretending I was talking to a god (I'm not religious) an that it was commanding me to do stuff. I did what ""it"" said all day (aka, I was deceiving myself on multiple levels) and did weird random stuff like pick flowers, wander around a store, etc. At the end of the day, I panicked, and for the first time, I threw up because of a panic attack. I want to stop obsessing over these things and acting them out like this and reinforcing the obsession! Has anyone else experienced this??"

Anxiety,Help?,"Well to keep things simple I haven’t had an easy life, kind of like everyone else here and I just wanted opinions to see how I could better myself for the future.

(I’m a 19 yo male btw)

Throughout middle and high school I’ve had to deal with a tremendous amount of anxiety and depression but as of recent both my anxiety and depression have hit levels that they’ve never reached before. My mother was a drug addict and my father was an alcoholic, I’ve lived with my mother all my life until she overdosed on heroin on my 17th birthday (yes, she’s still alive and im slowly working on repairing the very broken road that relationship is), now I live with my aunt. Living with my mother I was sheltered from the world in the worst ways possible because nothing could’ve prepared me for the world and how brutal it really is when you’re finished with high school. Throughout high school I was a very isolated person, I had a handful of friends and other than that I kept to myself (the entire 4 years) and now that I’m done with school my aunt told me I have to get a job or else she would throw me out of her house. I’ve submitted applications for things around me (I don’t have my drivers license or transportation to work other than walking) and I’m waiting for managers to get back to me but I haven’t received anything yet. The only places around me that I can work at within walking distance happen to be gas stations and my anxiety isn’t handling it so well. I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression disorders along with bipolar disorder, adhd and Ptsd from what my mother put me through. Whatever job I get will be my first ever actual job and my anxiety is ruining it for me completely. My thoughts go from being afraid that I’m going to get robbed at gunpoint to simply being afraid that I’m going to make many small mistakes leading up to me being fired and thrown on the streets. Even though that’s constantly on my mind I have another problem that isn’t just my anxiety, my depression has got to the point where I go literal full days without eating and it’s not anything I have any control over, I just don’t feel hungry much anymore and I keep forgetting to eat. It’s shocked me at first because I can get food ads on a day that I haven’t eaten and just act as a reminder that I should eat but never actually get around to eating and when I do eat I don’t get any enjoyment from it like I used to, I used to love the excitement behind trying a new dish and attempting new flavors but now everything seems so black and white and just boring. Idk. Sorry I made this so long for anyone that actually does take the time to read this. One final thing to add is I’m trying to get therapy for this but I haven’t found a therapist that I’m comfortable with and have confidence in so currently I’m not getting any actual help but I am working on it. So any ideas on how to just make life bareable right now?"
Anxiety,“I had a good childhood”,"My parents like to say I had such a good childhood, like they didn’t bring me into this world addicted to heroin, my child hood was great they say because they always took me and a friend out to do cool stuff like my dad wasn’t screaming at my mom the whole time home or when he would start hitting her while she’s driving, and me and my friend would put a blanket over us, or how on the way home EVERY FUCKING TIME they’d stop at their dealers house and come back take us to the park &amp; we’re so oblivious right, young kids... so sitting on the swing waiting for my dad to come push me but his too busy sitting the car shooting up with my mom, but yeah we totally didn’t know what was going on. EVERY SINGLE DAY. “We always let u have friends over” right coz it’s so great having friends over in year 7 while my dads abusing my mom and she’s racing to the room with a bottle of water and a spoon... and I would just be sitting on the couch with my friend and look down the dreading hallway and just wishing I could escape this feeling. Like the times Me and my sisters would come home from school and the dining room sliding door would be closed &amp; we could always see them shooting up with there junkie friends thru the kitchen but there just drinking tap water with spoons right?? 
All I want is for them to acknowledge this and take responsibility for this, instead they are in complete denial and every time I try to explain how my childhood has effected me so much they will not listen because they choose to believe that all they did was good and I’m just exaggerating"
Anxiety,"My anxiety/panic almost killed me, but there is hope. [POEMS]","A while ago now, I found myself at a crisis center. Plagued by panic, anxiety, depression, and associated alcohol abuse. Alcohol was the ONLY thing I had found that would stop an panic attack, and when I say panic attack I mean vicious hour + long attacks where I would go catatonic , and was so scared I couldn't move or speak. Anyways, in that crisis center I was Introduced to art. I am a former infantry Marine (2006-2010), and avid outdoorsman, and generally not someone who you would expect to see with a paintbrush and canvas. But friends, let me tell you.... forget any stigma you may have against being an artist. It is a way to cope that FAR exceeds any use of substance, and it is an outlet for things you never had a way /didn't know you needed to express. You don't have to be any good, and you don't have to do anything complicated, just give it a try. Draw something, color something, write a poem, paint. I promise you, it has the potential to change your life in an almost immeasurable and immediate way. I hope you all know you are not alone, and there are plenty of people out here who have been where you are. There is a lot of love, peace, happiness and beauty in this world. You can and you will have that someday if you don't right now. You may not ever be CURED but there are ways to cope and manage and enjoy life again. Much love to you all. Here are a few poems ...  Maybe not the best ever written. But remember, it just has to mean something to you.

I know I won’t be the only new hire so maybe there will be another clueless person or two who don’t know what to do, but I don’t even know where to go. I know that everything is something I have to learn and I think I’m okay with not knowing what’s going on kinda EXCEPT for literally not knowing where to go when I walk in :(
Maybe someone else has experienced something similar? If you have what did you do? (If it helps you give me an idea it’s just an average department store)"
Anxiety,I get anxious at receiving a reply/text message and I can't do anything else,"When I ask/reply someone a message, in waiting time, I get very anxious, I think of many questions: do they response, how do they think/response, did I say something wrong, it takes so long so they must have hated me or I did something wrong,...like I think a lot. I just keep starring at a message client and sometimes I dont want to eat despite meal time or hungry like to the point I think blood sugar level has been dropped low. 

Like recently because of Covid I'm allowed to work from home. I thought it would be good for me because I don't have interact directly with people. but still everything have to communicate by a chat system of my company. then I still have to report, have to reply when being asked and ask when I need to.. (I report something that I've done, I ask for something to do when there's nothing to do, I reply when they ask why I did that, .....) many situations that could let me anxious, I would think my message has something wrong (although in many cases there are nothing wrong) and that I will being judged....

Anyone have the same feeling?

I think having anxiety and depression make me dont have any ambition into my job and drained my energy that make me feel being lazy and think I'm not doing a good job. 

for social relationship message is the same, if I send a message or something and takes so long for my friends to reply it would make me worry if I did anything wrong."
Anxiety,Ativan SUCKS. Why is it even given to people?,"I had a severe attack early Sunday morning. Full on to PTSD levels, worrying I can't control the irrational part that self harms in response, and for once I went to the hospital instead of going it. That's progress, yay. 

Then they wanted to give me ativan. I asked if it was safe and they assured me it was. Well, it was awful. I did not feel less anxiety. Instead I felt like I was way deep underwater and couldn't do anything about it. It was like everything about me got shut down and I was trapped in a mini hell. 

Never again"
Anxiety,"Anyone else get anxious when you see a dead body in a Tv show, even though they aren’t actually dead?","I hate seeing people die in shows, and the camera shows it all. It’s horrible. Even though they are just playing dead it’s still convincing."
Anxiety,Stuck,I'm in freeze for 3 days because I have to write an email. Help me lol my brain is acting ridiculous.
Anxiety,Life wont ever be the same.,"So about an hour ago i had the worst anxiety attack. I’ve never been the type to be mentally broken as people would say. As i grew up i’ve always been true to myself and my morals but this year and last year has tested me to my limits. Growing up i always had my older brother to look up to and to teach me how to carry myself and provide for myself since my father and mother is old but recently about a year ago he’s been out of my life due to him studying and its been tough. I tend to always be the backbone for everyone and hold myself but now its my breaking point and i am genuinely confused to the point where i am confused about life. I just miss being young and innocent and enjoying the little things like going on a run with my brother or cooking with him and having late night talks. Im far from being lonely but it seems theres something missing from my life. I understand growing up can be tough but i thought it would be a phase since im only 16, its lasted longer than “just a phase”. Can anyone give me some wisdom and insight on what i can do to have hope for a better future. I have to start depending on myself more and its killing me everyday knowing that nothing will ever be the same. I just want life to go back to the simpler times."
Anxiety,My left arm/shoulder/chest always hurts after exercise,Anyone else get this it’s super scary because it just screams heart attack but if it was I would have had a heart attack every day for the last 5 months. Sometimes it just hurts really bad without exercise especially in the morning r late at night. Has anyone experienced this/found a coping mechanism
Anxiety,fucking pain,"before i start i think i should say i'm not medically diagnosed with anxiety. every time i tell my parents that it's not right and my anxiety attacks are happening they basically just tell me ""don't be anxious"". no help. what do i do?

secondly, how do you stop anxiety? i straight up get anxious over so many things and it's so bad to the point where i get anxiety induced diarrhea very often whenever i do literally anything besides sit at home. where my anxiety spirals out of control is where first i get anxious over the possibility of me getting anxious, then after that i get anxious over the forthcoming sharp ass stomach pain, and then the pain comes in. it literally cripples my social life to a ridiculous fucking mess where i can't do shit. 

is this normal or is this like really bad?"
Anxiety,My therapist is sick and cancelled my appointment :( I feel like I’m about to puke,"My last appointment was a month ago, because my therapist was on holiday. Now she is sick, and I will probably have to wait a few more weeks before I see her again... I’ve been struggling a lot the past couple of weeks, with random crying spells, headaches and panic attacks throughout the day. I’ve also been oversleeping so much my energy was almost non existent for a few days... I would really appreciate if any of you would be up for a chat just to distract my mind a bit from all this"
Anxiety,Fear of losing all thats important to me.,"Over the years I have developed a fear of losing people. I am constantly anxious about my actions and being good enough to be wanted and kept around. I have 2 amazing friends, we all support each other, and have all had rough years. As much as they reassure me that I wont lose them, it still panics me to think of life without them. My biggest fear at this moment in time is that my current episode is going to push them away. I dont know how to calm myself or stop overthiking silly things they say or do. I just want to be happy with what I have and stop worrying about what I might lose or what life will be like in the future. I do not want to be a burden to them but feel I already am."
Anxiety,Odd symptomes,"I'm more and more often having trouble finding words, it used to be just trouble remembering people's name, now its common word that have a hard time poping in my head. They usually come back after few minutes when i stop looking for them.

&amp;#x200B;

is it a common anxiety symptome or should i get a brain scan?"
Anxiety,Feeling stuck,"I feel so bad rn, i have 2 exams tommorow and i just can't get to work, i want to work but it's just that when i pick up the papers i can't process anything. I've always had anxiety around school and i have been skipping classes for the last 5 years but i haven't told anybody about it ( didn't even have the courage to tell my psychologist, how fucking dumb am i), plus i have had some other health issues last year which makes my brain even less performant. I'm so scared of failing that i feel like throwing up and i don't even know if i can tell my parents about my anxiety with school because they always tell me that i'm a brilliant student and i don't want to betray those expectation. To be honest right now i can only think about skipping the exams even if i know that it will make things worse. What should i do ? Who should i talk to ? How can i get myself to work ? Plz help"
Anxiety,I lie to my therapist. A lot.,"I have a zoom therapy session this afternoon and I'm spending my morning carefully crafting how I'm going to tell my therapist how well I'm doing with my anxiety, my weight loss and my depression. 

None of it is true. But yes given me lots of exercises and life changes to try and improve and the truth is I've done a minimal amount of them but I'm too shamed to tell him that. So I fake it and act like things are much better than they are in reality. 

I do this even though I know it's stupid and means I'm paying 50 bucks to lie to someone I'm paying to help me. This is...insane."
Anxiety,I need to make my friend agree to therapy. He's wasting away. Help please.,"He is wasting away, I can see it. Anxiety, depression, bulimia and more and more. I can't watch it and I can't do nothing. It is killing me, watching him like this. He has a nihilistic point of view as well and thinks it's all pointless anyway and I don't know how to convince him that therapy will help him. That there is hope. He has tried numerous times to finish university but he stops going every time after a semester or two. He says ""yes, but what do i study for? Work for what? What's the point? I'm fine this way."" he is stubborn. Idk what to do. I'd even pay for his therapy. If he agrees. If he just goes. How do I make him get better? How do I make him agree? I need him to fight this off."
Anxiety,I feel like my heart rate is higher than it is,"Anyone ever feel like their heart rate is higher than it is? I definitely have some sort of anxiety, as I have a lot of trouble sleeping (heart rate is definitely high then) but during waking hours I feel like my heart is beating really fast but when I check my heart rate monitor, I'm in the normal 70-80 BPM area. Is it because I'm sleep deprived or what?"
Anxiety,Failed a exam and feeling so anxious.,"Believe I have a C in the class now. Need to survive the final this week yet. Feeling so nervous, and like a failure, and I really don't want to screw this up or I feel like I'll be such a disappointment. It's through a work compensation program, so it feels like so much at stake,and everyone always expects me to do well, but I feel like a massive failure."
Anxiety,Failed an exam and feeling so anxious.,"I believe I have a C now. Still need to survive the final this week. Everyone always expects to do so well, and I feel like I'm being a massive failure and disappointment. It's through a work compensation program too and it just feels like so much is at stake, I don't want to let people down...I want to do well. I feel awful."
Anxiety,Starting my job today..,It’s currently 7am and I’m so tired. Plus my anxiety is taking over me. I’m so nervous for my first day on this job. I know i’ll be fine after a couple months but i’m so scared.. 😔 I wish I could just calm down. It’s a whole 7 hours that I have to be out.
Anxiety,I feel like there is no hope for me,I just believe I'll always be stuck like this
Anxiety,I need some urgent support and advice for my problem ASAP:Me (17M) and my classmate (17F)(long story),"(Be advised , I'm going to use fake names for security/privacy purposes)

(Sorry if I my English is bad ( third language ) )

I'm Jack , 17 y.o student in High school (I'm Tunisian so we have a different school system . There are 4 grades in high school and I'm 3rd grade , and the 4th is the baccalaureate and then University)

So some info about me , I'm an introverted male , never been in a relationship , not much friends , socially akward , paranoied and got many anxiety disorders ( **Self**\-**diagnosis** ) , low self-esteem , and I'm pretty smart and good-looking ( as I was told xD )So everything started when I entered the high school 2 years ago :

**First Grade :** So I'm among the first students in the school ( or was xD ) and I have my reputation ( I wear classy clothes and I'm known as FBI because I can get any info I want on any person ..) So things were good until I noticed a girl in the other class , let's call her Diana , so Diana was from the Pioneer Secondary School ( before the high school , some kind of elite school for elite students ) and I liked her , ( I know her because my cousin was her classmate ) And I started to have some strange feelings. So I started taking some photos and following her and then I wrote a journal and I collected some pics of her house and set them in the journal , everything was fine until the journal got leaked ( no need to dive into details ) and I didn't know that at the time , and I got undirectly rejected and I got really sad , like really really sad , probably depressed , abandoned my studies and my own health for 4 months and I my average fell from 17/20 to 14/20 and there is very very large and big gap between 17/20 and 14/20 , I didn't care at all . Couple of friends were there for me and helped me to get back on my feet and I managed to increase my average to 15/20 and I moved on . That Summer I tried see what went wrong ( I'm a rational guy and I like analyzing things and I like psychology ) and I started discovering things about emotions and love and all that stuff and I swore an oath to not fall into that ""trap"" again in the next grade.

(smth forgot to mention , I'm on #nofap journey and , this detail can probably clear things for you )

**Second Grade :** Second Grade , Science Section , first couple of weeks went good , some familiar faces , some friends from the previous grade , and some other people I know , and an Old friend , let's call her Wendy , I knew her for 5 years . So I started catching up with Wendy and we started to talk more , everything normal . Until one day , our professor was absent so we had an empty hour, I stayed with her and some other classmates in our class and then she started talking to her friend , let's call her Angel ( this is the 17F ) and I stayed in the corner reading a book , then Wendy invited me to chat with them ( there was another girl with them , a friend of Angel, let's call her Isabell ) So we started chatting , I didn't talk so much , because Angel and Isabell were strangers ) .

The next day , it was a 2h technical studies session , I was in group of 5 and Angel was one of them , we finished our exercises in 1hr and somehow we started talking and discussing about many topics , we started with politics and then dived to more deeper things like philosophy and physics and chemistry . I felt like I found someone who can understand those topics and I can discuss it with , it felt amazing , something I never felt before , a mix of joy and relief. Once we got home , we chatted for 5hr straight ( 7PM to 00 AM ) We talked about psychology and many other things , she mentioned smth : "" I did know you nd I was pretty sure w'll be good friends "" and "" Wendy told me about how mindful you are last year and I automatically knew that you were one of those rare people "" You can't imagine how happy I was when she told me that . I felt something more exciting , I found someone who finally UNDERSTANDS ME. I was very happy , like I'm on top of the world. We became close friends within a week. She said she quickly trusted me which is ""rare"" . We talked about "" love "" and then she told me this "" I'm an atheist when it come to love "" ( Is it true ? can someone be like that ?)So we kept talking and chatting like that for a month , and we started to sit close to each other in class. And I remember a saturday night , I was bored so within 30 min I tracked her house and then I felt some guilt and I said to myself "" If I don't stop this , I will repeat the same mistake as Diana "" So I stopped

And things went good until one day.

One day , my cousin came to me and told me that Isabell knows that I was interested and probably had a crush on Angel , and she is willing to tell her, thank god my cousin convinced her to not do that. At night , I chatted with Isabell about that subject and about Angel and how I just want to keep a friendly relationship until I sentenced myself to die , I accidentally told her that I know where Angel lives, and Isabell was like 😮 . She was shocked , and she told me she will try to keep this ""shit"" secret because it was 'scary"" as she said . Long story short , my ""secret"" didn't make 4 days , I fought with Isabell and she decided to tell Angel , so I went to tell her first , at least she will hear that shit from me , but it was toooooooooooo late. That day was fucked up , I didn't fell good at all , didn't look good , my face was pretty yellow , I had headaches , didn't focus on a very important chemistry lesson , so I didn't understand it at all. I went back home , I closed my room and started writing , until I wrote a very long letter , it took me 3hr. I sent it , she read it and she said she needs time , I said ok. I went to check Isabell and tried to open up a conversation so we can discuss what happened , I told her to send me the last science lesson we learnt ( I just wanted to open up a damn conversation ) and she said "" screw you "" Out of anger I wrote another letter , this time for Isabell and it wasn't good one , sent it . After couple of days she read it and she got mad how I said such a thing about her , again long story short , she told Angel , and after another chat with Angel she said she will forgive me when Isabell do. A detail to mention , that whole shit happened a couple of days before the semster's exams , so at least you know how stressed I was.

After 3 months , we started slowly chatting back , me and Angel , but it was never the same as before , and then the COVID-19. We chatted a bit in the first months of the COVID and then ( Juin ) I sent her a message and she didn't replay , no "" seen "" so my paranoia and overthinking assumed that she was ignoring me . Didn't talk to her.

**Third Grade :** sept. 15 : we came back to school and she was my classmate , didn't talk to her for the first couple of days then I had to tell her that I have an amount of money to give her ( last year she gave me some money for some donation purposes and the donation was canceled)

I gave her her money back , and after 1 hour I was talking to a friend and she joined the discussion, step by step we started talking about some things like the pandemic, system ... And then we talked about smth ( no need to mention it , a casual thing ) and I wanted her to convince me to do that thing ( again , a casual thing , not smth important ) she said ok , that night we talked a little bit about that subject and she said that she will continue the conversation tomorrow.

The next day , I was looking for her and I found her talking with a classmate so I didn't approach her and thought she will probably be bothered if I asked her.

When we were walking out of school I asked her and she said : ""Why didn't you come earlier ?""

I said that I saw her with a couple of mates talking and she said : ""That won't bother me , we are friends for 2 years , like you are not a new mate ""

When I heard that I became happy , because I knew right then and there that she wasn't angry at me.

We chatted about that subject at night and then we opened one of those deep psychology subjects, and I felt that she became too open for a while , she told me that "" she got her heart broken"" and then she deleted the message because she "" don't like word broken "" .

The next night , we started talking as usual , but things went south this time , I was asking questions ( usual ) and I asked her "" why are you answering my questions ? "" she didn't respond. And then suddenly she started asking some strange questions ( Do you think evrthg I said is framed ? Do you think I'm framed ? Do you think I trust you ? Do you trust me ? Is this a safe place ? Do I care about trusting you ? .....)

Then she answered my question : ""I was just talking to a '' friend'' "" and said : "" Remember what you told me last year about evrthg you and your struggles with being an introvert and then one of your biggest regrets what you did to Diana Then you did the same thing with me and I got pretty angry but I ended up forgetting about it because I started considering you as a friend that's why I answered your questions Because I still considered you as a friend but it's clear we don't have the same intentions ""

I was pretty shocked and said : So do I , believe or not those emotions were not real and not compatible with me , why ? because for the last 2 years I was unconsciously forcing them, explains why they don't exist when I rationalize them. So do I , I consider you as a friend .

I didn't sleep that night , and I got mad and sad , like really sad , I felt smth painful, I was stressed and started going down.

(that was 10 days ago )

(this was 7 days ago ) A couple of friends came to me and talked to me and told me to move on and forget her , they even tried to force me to unfriend her from Facebook, I can't, every day I read those old beautiful conversations about the topics I love. And I regret every single mistake I made. I see her connected and I feel sad because I can't talk to her , or I'm forcing myself not to. I feel guilty because she trusted me within a week, she was expecting me to be a new good friend but I betrayed all of that.

She also told me that she is "" Insidious "" ( this is her own term ) If anyone can explain this term.

After collecting some Intel I found that:

When she told me I'm rare , she said I'm the second rare guy she meets , there was a guy before me , and he ""badly screwed it up"" as she said , so she didn't talk to him anymore , something needs to be mentioned , she said that she passed every single summer night chatting with him , with another detail ""we were just friends"". Another thing , in the Second Grade , we were talking in the school about depression and inner problems and issues and she said she was fighting that crap for 2 years , another thing , as I said above , she recently told me that she got her ""heart broken"" and got ""betrayed from a close one"" , and chose to not tell me who or what the story as she said : "" you've known enough about me already hopefully you'll understand "" and "" Some things are just better left unsaid that's all "". She also said that "" I just don't rlly open up so I usually I'm the only person to calm myself down and get my shit together u know sometimes it's just tiring a little bit but I'm not gonna stay like this forever though "" . A very important detail which is : ""No one rlly gets me I'm kinda complicated I'm a bit holistic and love to think big so I never rlly met anyone who actually knew me, maybe if am being permissive only one person "" . There are many details, I tried to set the most important ones .

She is, according to my Theory , Injured and wounded , that first rare guy probably broke her heart and that changed her , probably made her toxic(emotionally) , so she started hating feelings because she don't want to be vulnerable...(Some details are 3 to 4 years old, I started linking the pieces trying to find why she is like that )

Anyway , if you reached here then I really thank you for reading all of my crap and drama-shit, and I want to hear your advice, your suggestions, everything will help I just want to fix this if it is possible , can I win her back , can I get her out of her darkness , is she really injured and can my theory be true ?( professional help like a Psy. is acquired )

TD:LR : I have some issues with a very complicated girl , who doesn't show emotions and doesn't like love. I'm trying to figure out why she is like that, help me if you can, thank you :)"
Anxiety,"Anxiety from new job is making me lose sleep, more emotional and I can barely eat.","I've been in this line of work for 4 years now. I recently accepted a new job, exactly the same role at another company with a significant raise in my salary. But the way they operate is much much different in regards to their policies and its so strict and extremely detail oriented.. I'm having difficulty adjusting. I used to pay too much attention to detail and management had made me stop and now I have to get back into being as detailed oriented as possible.

I'm just really freaking anxious cause based on my colleague reviewing my work...i know for a fact I'm going to fail audits and we get audited on every file we work on. I know I'm new, I know it takes an average of 3 months for people to settle into a new job. But the anxiety is making me lose sleep. I think I got 2 hours last night. I can barely deal with any other stresses outside of work that I end up crying. I'm in my damn 30s and I'm crying cause I can't handle anymore stress/anxiety. I can't even eat.
I wanted this job for more money... Now I don't know if it's even worth it anymore. All the concerns in my mind are moving 2000000km/hr. I want to quit. I want to quit... But I know I shouldn't be running from my problems. I just want a big long hug and curl up into a ball in bed under all my blankets and hibernate and not worry about work."
Anxiety,How to make safe environment for friend with anxiety issues?,"I have a friend who is suffering from anxiety and has panic attacks really often when we hang out with our group, apparently the attacks are so bad that he avoids hanging out with friends in fear of a panic attack. He is not talking about it so could some of you give me some insight how it feels and how to behave so it would be easier for him to be with friends? I just want to help him so he can escape the ""moms basement"" and live a normal life."
Anxiety,Going to the eye doctor today wish me luck!,Since about a month ago I started having some eye irritation so I thought it was my contacts and went to the eye doctor to find out my left eye has some pressure on it. My doctor thought it could be because I used steroid eye drops and that can raise the pressure. Now a month later I’m still feeling the pressure and some redness. I’m so terrified if this is more than just anxiety! I never had any eye problems except for having to wear contacts and glasses and I have a high prescription but that is it. I’m only 27 and I can’t even process going blind at such a young age or if at all ever in my life. I feel like my life would be over if I were. I’m so scared of what this could be. But part of me is like well some of it could be anxiety related maybe? I’m like 50/50 scared and partially excited because if it is just anxiety then I know I’m going to feel a huge sigh of relief today and my anxiety will be lifted but if not then that’s a whole different story!
Anxiety,How do I genuinely treat anxiety/stress,"I know it’s a broad question, 

But I’ve come to the realisation that I’m really struggling. 

I lost my farther a few months ago at the age of 18. 

I feel sick constantly, I struggle to eat because I just feel like throwing up. I really struggle with going out socially because I again feel sick, and I obvisoly don’t want to be sick in public ie the cinema. A few other things like heavy sweating, tingling in hands made me think I have anxiety. 

I’ve never actually thrown up due to this. But I’m hungry most of the time due to it. 

The only answer I can find is therapy. I don’t want therapy. I really don’t see how talking about it will help when I can just write it here or tell someone else to no avail. 

What’s my next step? Thanks"
Anxiety,Do Monday’s activate anyone else’s fight or flight response like they do to me?,"Monday’s are the worst day of the week for me by far. I know no one likes Monday especially if they have to work like I do. However I am afraid of them. I actually start to hyperventilate.

If it weren’t for meditation I wouldn’t make to work. I have called out so often in the past that I have been fired due to too many absences. All so I could lay under a blanket(head and all) and pretend everything was ok and I was “safe from the world in there.

I’m freaking out now.. leave for work in an hour..."
Anxiety,I took a taxi for the first time!,"This was a couple days ago. I'm 23 years old and have never taken a taxi on my own terms. Always with someone else, even then it would be rare. Which is embarrassing because my family owned a taxi firm my entire childhood... 
But I finally did it! I was super shaky when I got home, but I survived! 
The reason for my breakthrough though is kinda sad. I usually would walk home from the train station which is almost an hour to walk with several uphills. But this time it was broad daylight and I was too embarrassed to drag my bags and suitcase with me. Because i thought people would stare and judge me. Maybe even someone I knew would drive past and question me... So I took a taxi impulsively to avoid possibly being judged. Funny that ahaha...."
Anxiety,Heightened reaction and getting stressed about everything,"Every since I was kid Ive always struggled with anxiety and stress. In the past I was able to manage it. But as I get older, it’s becoming harder to stop stressing even over the smallest and trivial things. Whenever I get overly excited I get stressed, whenever I’m sad I get stressed, whenever I’m bored I get stressed, whenever I’m busy I’m stressed. I guess I call it a heightened reaction because every time I react to something I get stressed. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Deep down I know I shouldn’t be stressing, but my brain just won’t shut off"
Anxiety,I've been getting nightmares lately..,"Getting some terrible nightmares lately about my education. I know it's probably cause of my worries and anxiety towards the particular event. I said that I'll accept the fact if I get failed in re-exam.. but I'm genuinely tired of being stuck in highschool. I'm really having fun in online classes of university, my curiosity and creativity is also peaked. But If I fail the re-exam, my admission will be cancelled and I'll have to wait for yet another year to join university. 

I'm already 2 years late...[ I took a drop once cause of health issues after sophomore, and I failed myself last year from extreme pressure]. I don't think I'll be able to study the last year of highschool for the third time.. I feel like I'm dumb, but I know I'm not. The thing that stops me from passing is my anxiety which screws me over the exam. 

Anyhow, My result will be out within 5 days, but Can I really wait? Idk. I'm not sure if I'm prepared myself to face reality either whether I pass or terribly fail."
Anxiety,Do I just got this assignment to do for English class and this is my worst nightmare,"We are reading Beowulf and we have to write a boasting poem and film ourselves doing it. I can’t boast because I hate everything about myself, I don’t know how to write poems like at all, and I HATE filming myself doing anything. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to calmly do this and not sound too nervous or how to write a poem???"
Anxiety,Illogical thoughts,"I'm (19M) a student who has always lived categorized as the ""smart kid"" as I skipped 2 grades in primary school. I hate being treated as such as I find myself really dumb particularly socially speaking. I feel like I've lived my whole life socially late, like everything that seems socially normal for my friends, I understand it several years after.

I've developed this summer an anxiety disorder (regular hypertension and panic attacks since then) but I feel like these are only amplified symptoms of my normal state : I'm constantly anxious especially socially, apart from that it feels like normal life ""pressure"".

The thing is, I only have a few friends, and as I have always been, I really doubt being a *real* friend for them (they don't act between them as they do with me) even though we *seem* pretty close. And I've finally found the strength to share what has been happening to me this summer, which prevented me to meet them after 3 months of lockdown and work. But it seems like they did not really care, were only polite to say ""that's sad, keep strength"" and stuff, but I don't think they realize the impact it has on me. 

That makes me doubt more and more our friendship and that's the reason of this post. I believe I can call this social anxiety, but how to deal with this impression to not know what is socially normal ?

Sorry for potentially weird phrasing, not a native speaker, and thanks for your answers"
Anxiety,Purchase anxiety?,"I generally don't have anxiety or irrational fears. But my family grew up insane about saving money (though we had it until the recession and my parents divorced and it was just a mess.)

Anyway, I'm 24 years old, broke my laptop, and am feeling ridiculous because I can't order a new one. I have the money, I just physically/psychologically? I don't know, but I can't order it.

I've already bought and returned two over two months, canceled even more orders. My heartbeat goes crazy when I type in my card #, I start shaking, and when I get it, I want it out of my house immediately because I don't think ""I deserve it."" I'm afraid I'll get the 'wrong' one, as a child if I made a wrong decision concerning money, or asked for a toy that happened to break later, that was wholly and 100% on me. I feel like that now, I feel so stupid because I'm a grown ass woman and it's my money. But also terrified because I'm a grown ass woman and it's my money.

I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I've always had problems spending money as I got older. I've never bought anything like this all at once. It's so stupid. Advice please so I can just order the damn thing?"
Anxiety,Anxiety about workplace and making mistakes,"Hi all,

I have major anxiety related to my workplace. I teach at a university and I feel like I'm under so much pressure all the time.   
I have GAD and OCD. I am very hard on myself and get really anxious if I make any kind of mistake or things don't go to plan. I know I'm good at my job but I still get very tripped up with anxiety. I catastrophize and I also think ahead to potential things that could go wrong. I'm scared of looking bad in front of the students and doing something that would cost me my job. Right now I'm having a bout of insomnia related to job stress. Not sure if anyone can relate."
Anxiety,I hate when having a bad mental health day makes me seem like a flake,"Calling in sick to work or having to cancel on some obligations or plans to meet someone because I just can't face the day - it makes me feel pathetic. 

I tend to just say I'm feeling unwell rather than that it's anxiety too, not because I necessarily think that they won't understand but that the idea of disclosing my anxiety issues to people who don't know I have them gives me even more anxiety. 

It makes me feel extremely guilty when I look at other people doing worse jobs with bigger workloads who don't seem to struggle to just get on with it. I have an extremely forgiving schedule and do work I enjoy but still have these days where I'm a useless lump who can't do anything. How do I look at my co-worker who is a single mum with two kids and say I haven't done my share of a project yet because my stupid feelings are too much to bear?"
Anxiety,"Maybe obvious, but I finally see the direct connection between my painful childhood and my adult anxiety. Now what to do about it?","I have had severe anxiety for my entire adulthood.  Meds don’t touch it.  Regular cognitive behavioural therapy has never been able to ‘punch through’ to the source of the pain, always only dealing with the symptoms in some horrible whack-a-mole type game.  

I have always struggled with the feeling that I was a ‘bad kid’ when young, a ‘bad person’ as an adult.  In my core, I have always thought I was just bad.

I have for years avoided my family and allowed a very limited relationship with them, without ever really knowing why.  They are not bad people, in fact, my entire family has always been loving and supportive to me.  


Yesterday, I spoke on the phone to my mom.  Despite me desperately not wanting to talk about the past at all, she shared one or two stories about how I was growing up....  they were really not terrible and my mom tried to do it with gentleness.  But I ended up crying so hard that we had to cut the phone conversation short.  I had horrible anxiety all night and have been weepy all morning.  The pain of a lifetime of being a ‘bad kid’ in my own mind is all just right at the surface.

It might seem obvious to everyone, but I never connected the fact that my anxiety is my mind’s attempt to avoid the thoughts and feelings that I am a bad kid.   But I finally see it today.

So my question: what do I do about it?  How do i heal this awful wound?  How do I let go of the deeply entrenched idea that I am a bad person?  Objectively, I know I am not.  But the pain is so real, so intense that I have spend my entire life trying to get away from it.  

Is there anyone/anything that can act as a guide for me as I walk down this horrible path?  I want to see it all the way through, so that I can finally put this monstrous lie to bed."

Anxiety,Exercising makes my anxiety worse,"I hate to admit this and quite frankly, I’m really embarrassed about it. For some reason when I exercise my anxiety gets worse. I think it’s because I hate the feeling of my heart racing so fast and it reminds me of the feeling of having a panic attack, then I confuse it with an actual panic attack. I feel so useless, I can’t even exercise without getting anxious."
Anxiety,Seasonal depression/ anxiety,"Is anyone else’s seasonal depression/anxiety horrible right now? I always have anxiety, but lately I feel like it’s super high."
Anxiety,Worst case scenario,"In almost every situation I’m in, I think of the worst case scenario. I used to take pride in this because I am almost always prepared for anything but it’s also the main reason for my anxiety and panic attacks.

When I worry about these worst case scenarios, my therapist asks me “is it necessary?” - is it necessary to think of situations that aren’t happening. My answer was always no because it’s true. It’s not necessary. 

There are some situations where prepping for the worst case scenario is helpful. I just need to be mindful when it is necessary or not."
Anxiety,Anxiety after weight loss,"Feeling terribly anxious. Have lost some weight over last six months, feel that's been successful. Haven't seen people in a while, yesterday went to relatives to celebrate a socially distant birthday. However, came back feeling terribly anxious after discussing my diet and answering their concerned questions and listening to best wishes for maintenance. So much so that I'm having intestinal cramps and digestive issues today, and also a gout flare up. This sucks. Just started new job and was feeling great, now feeling like everything is doomed. Anxiety and depression is hovering around again and I am not sure why I'm feeling like this."
Anxiety,Calm Happy People,"I’ve never used reddit before but I suffer with anxiety so started an Instagram account to help me stay calm and happy.

Anxiety,DAE get a physical feeling of stillness &amp; weightlessness during anxiety spikes?,"I have noticed within the past year or so that sometimes my anxiety results in a strange physical sensation. I would describe it as my entire body feeling very ""still"" or ""empty,"" almost like I'm floating or weightless, or like my heart isn't beating even though it is (I always check my vitals when this happens and everything is normal).

Does anyone else ever experience this? And does anyone know why it happens? Any replies would be greatly appreciated :)"
Anxiety,I get anxious when I try to learn something new,"Rules to a new board game, a new work process, a skill like diving, etc etc. Basically anything new to me. I obsess if I am comprehending the rules correctly. If I am doing the task/activity right. If my questions are stupid or not. I’m concerned about what people think of me while I’m learning this new task/activity/skill. 

I always end up learning things on my own first before doing it in a group because I worry what people think. How to overcome this?"
Anxiety,Do you feel extremely anxious for no reason?,"I feel terribly anxious the past couple weeks - shaking, nausea, tummy aches, palpitations and sometimes heartbroken but there's no logical reason for me to feel like this. Initially I thought it was because I was returning to work after I was signed off for two months due to fractured ribs but my colleagues were so welcoming and I was happy to be back, yet the anxiety seems to be getting worse. I've lost a bit of weight in a short amount of time too because I got bored of eating or I'm too anxious to chew and swallow my food. I just want to feel okay again. 

A friend recommended me to try 5HTP so I'm going to give that a go. In the meantime, I now have a weighted blanket so at least it would make me feel like I'm being hugged, haha. 

Take care, all."
Anxiety,Caught in the middle and feeling broken,"I teach at a college (name and location to remain unknown) that is doing mandatory covid testing on students. I may be biased, but I have some excellent students, two of whom objected to the testing out of privacy concerns, as the college wanted their medical insurance information. The students have tried to work with administration on a compromise to no avail. In order to return to class they must be tested, but now no one will return their correspondence to set up a testing appointment. Part of me wants to do something, but I am so afraid to do so, and would honestly just rather break down and cry. Although I understand the mentality behind the test, the forcing of it and requirement of the insurance information seems excessive. Part of me wants to rise up like a bear, and another part of me wants to ball up in a corner. Anxiety sucks."
Anxiety,My family invited me to dinner to have a blessing for my Dad,"I'm catholic, the blessing is for my dad cause hes very sick so I told me mom I wouldnt miss it. So when the time comes and I arrive, i find they already all are dinner and finished the blessing without me. This just makes me feel like I'm not even important to them at all and they dont care if I'm there or not :( am I right to feel this way? Cause I was having anxiety on the drive over thinking ""they dont care about you they dont need you"" but I overcame it telling myself it was all lies. But what do you do when it actually comes true? I want to spend more time with my father but I'm annoyed with all of them for ditching me"

I’m honestly so sick of going through life like this, I constantly am thinking of what I should worry about next. When I’m with my boyfriend I’m more relaxed but I don’t want to have to rely on him to sleep or just in general.

Before 2020, I used to be quite an amicable and sociable person. I've always felt anxious before meeting someone new or having to hang out with someone I'm not very close to, one-on-one, but it was something that I could handle. However, during this pandemic, we all quarantined for months and now that things are easing up in my country and we are allowed to travel and meet our friends a bit more freely, I feel very very anxious. I feel like I've forgotten how to socialise with people, I'm not quite sure what to talk about. My mind is just always blank and feel nauseous hours before I have to meet someone. I just started an internship recently and I've been absolutely DREADFUL at making conversation with my colleagues. Usually, I'd be awkward for the first one week but I'd be able to ease into a new setting and converse with people. But this time round, I've been in the company for around a month and I can't seem to converse with anyone. And don't get me wrong, the people who I'm working with are absolutely lovely, they initiate conversations also. But I seem to have forgotten how to converse in full sentences, how to continue a healthy conversation. And it really SUCKS. THIS FEELING. And the painfully awkward moments that everyone around me has to endure. What can I do to cope with this better? Anyone has any tips? Or maybe does anyone else feel this way?"

Yesterday I ate some potato chips and felt a very noticable lump in my throat. I had just calmed down so I thought, ""no way this could be anxiety!"". I spent the whole day yesterday thinking I had developed a new allergy, inadvertently making the lump in my throat worse. 

Well, today I ate the same bag of potatoes again (a lot more). It's been 1-2 hours and I have not had the reaction! I know it's small, but I'm relieved! I feel one step closer to conquering my anxiety now I know how real the physical symptoms are!"
Anxiety,I think I might have gotten my first panic attack because of my recent break up,"My ex gf broke up with me, out of nowhere few days ago, without giving explanation and i have to see her every day in university.

Today was the first day we had to go in lectures since the break up and as soon as i woke up i was shaking. 

The nearer i was getting to the university the worst it was becoming. 
When i entered the building and started going up the stairs i felt dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous and my muscles started hurting. 
When i was already on the 4th floor where my first lecture was, i had shortness of breath, my mouth was super dry, and almost fainted + the symptoms from before (i am atletic and healthy) . It was severe for around 15minutes and then it calmed down. But i felt the symptoms, untill we finished lectures. 

When i went home i cried for a little and then went to the toiled and had diarrhea(i haven't eaten anything since she broke up with me, thats 4 days now).

 At the moment of writing this i still shake a little and dont feel good at all. I am not hungry either (which is weird for me as i am 87kg and 190cm tall and get hungry as soon as i wake up or after lectures usually)

I need advices please"
Anxiety,How to cope when you can't escape a trigger?,"content warning if you have any sort of aversion to bugs. 

\---

Hi everyone - I'm a long-time anxiety sufferer, but have been managing pretty well with a combination of meds and therapy. That is, until something happens that manages to knock me too far off balance. 

Long story short, I have a bit of an ant problem. I got back from a visit to a friend, and bam, ants in my apartment.  Obviously a bit of a stressor for anyone, but even after putting down my own bait traps (somewhat effective, but still had ants) and calling a pest control company (they put down more bait, jury's still out on how effective it is), I still find a few of them crawling around my kitchen floor every day. 

I think this wouldn't be an issue if they weren't in the kitchen, but I'm reaching the point where I can't seem to function normally anymore. I wake up super tense and anxious. I go to bed tense and anxious. I haven't been eating well because I'm afraid to cook or eat food in the vicinity of the ants. My body is pretty angry at me. I have at least one breakdown to a friend or family member a day. Sometimes I can't do anything but cry.

I feel ridiculous. The ants are small. I *know* they can't hurt me. I *know* this may be something I have to live with for a bit while the professionals figure out where they're coming from and how to get to the source of the problem. But try telling that to the anxiety elephant sitting on my chest. 

I've experienced a similar pattern of events before with different issues. Something happens that's out of my control and that I can't escape from. I get into a pattern of really bad anxiety in the morning and at night, with some reprieve during the day while I'm at work or talking to people I trust. I start to avoid activities that bring me into contact with the trigger that I can't control. Weekends are generally terrible. 

If anyone else has had similar experiences and/or found a coping mechanism that helps manage the intense waves of anxiety, I'd appreciate hearing from you. Mostly, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel really alone (it doesn't help that I live alone) and I'm scared. Thanks."
Anxiety,Anyone else very scared of loud noises?,"I'm not sure if this is caused by anxiety but simple things like the door being slammed shut make me shake and hearing muffled loud talking/arguing makes me tear up because I most of the time think its because of me.

Anxiety,Is This Burn Out?,"TW: s\*lf-h\*\*m, ED, s\*\*\*\*\*e, TLDR at end

Shortened version blocked off towards end

I'm really not sure where else I could ask this because I'm not the direct type with my feelings. I'm struggling with the thought of even telling my family and I honestly suck at talking to my psychiatrist because she makes it clear she's too busy for me. I'm paranoid to ask my other psychiatrist because she's affiliated with my school. I just want an honest answer from someone who's impartial without it affecting my life in some way. Yeah, it's Reddit, but I'm the extreme ""over cautious"" LOL

It's a bit of a story, so I'm sorry if it's too much.

I've suffered with serious panic disorder/anxiety since I was young, my parents think it’s on the “genetic” side for me. I had Colic as a baby. I had acid reflux as a toddler. I grew up with stomach pains constantly, puking every morning, randomly passing out, and joint pain. I was that ""sick kid"" all through elementary and middle school. It wasn't until I got to junior high (8/9 grade in my district) that I started having panic attacks full blown. They were awful and constant. There were days I just blacked out in the hallway, days my teachers had to take me to the nurse. I was eventually diagnosed, truly, with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and depression at 14. I got on medication, I was ""good"" for a while.

As far as my parents knew, I was doing completely fine once I started the meds. I had maintained a 4.00 GPA all through school and had taken multiple AP courses as well. I was a good student, as weird as it is to say. I was in every music/arts group, I was a drum major, and I was a captain of the golf team. I was able to funnel myself into every outlet I wanted to. I was this creative person who wrote and sold art in my spare time. My mother championed me once I was diagnosed, so proud of everything I could do while dealing with ""mental health 24/7"". She incorporated everything she learned in her studying on mental health into her teaching (she's an educator). It really made it a difference, I could hear it in the stories she told me about her interactions with students. She emphasized school so heavily growing up, monitoring our grades and emails. She was the only one in her family of first-gen Americans to go to a university. My dad hadn’t truly gone away either, just doing an online degree in his 40’s. It was odd, but for whatever reason, I internalized that *so much*. All I wanted to do was make my mother proud. I loved hearing how she helped people with how she felt about me. I loved hearing her brag to my family about me becoming a doctor. I loved my extended family telling me everyone was so proud of me “going away and doing great things”. I wanted to keep that feeling she (and everyone else) had about me no matter what it took.

Because of this and not wanting to taint her beautiful image of me, I did everything I could to suppress my feelings. The meds *had* worked, but they stopped after a while. I developed really disordered eating and SH habits. I was small, I was hurting myself in multiple different ways. I never said anything. I tried taking a ton of pills once, but it wasn't a conscious suicide-attempt. I think it was more dissociative than anything. I felt like my mom knew to some degree I was hurting myself, but I never had any event happen where I can say for sure. I eventually ""corrected"" myself as I say with the help of my friends, who had all been through their own mental health struggles in some way.

I suppressed it and ignored it until I went to college. I had gotten the full-ride I competed for, was in the major I wanted, and had lucked out in multiple different ways leading up to my first semester. All that lack of sleep, nights from crying from studying, joint pain from writing, and stress puking was worth it now… right? School was my focus. It always had been. It was my identity. College was supposed to be what I was made for… but from there, I crashed. I called my family every day, talking about these great things I was doing in band, and the whole time I was binging and spiraling. I managed to stay afloat by begging professors for second chances and using my disability accommodations I had gotten once I went off to school. By the end of my freshman semester of college, I had been on 3 different anxiety meds and was on 4 total. I was also 35 lbs heavier than my weight when I left HS.

This killed my confidence in my second year. I hated music at this point. My college's marching band was very clique-based. The sections' individual cultures were really intense and mine was none existent. People were mean. I talked to no one for 14 hrs every Saturday and it was much more obvious it was intentional. Now, something I had looked forward to all of HS was a bust and I wanted nothing to do with it. Second semester of sophomore year comes around and COVID has hit. I have to go home. I went from my one-bedroom on-campus apartment with my service dog (gotten summer between freshman and sophomore year) back home to my mom teaching from home, my sister (16F) learning from home, and me as well.

I'm 5 different meds in, on 4 still, and none of them are working. I'm in the worst possible place I could be. All while I was dealing with my anxiety/depression worsening with the pressure of college and hiding it to try to stay afloat, my sister had been dealing with hers in much more obvious, destructive ways. Her issues have been stemming from social issues, having changed schools the year before. She was skipping school, flunking, abusing pot, and verbal abusing my mother to the point of tears. I had heard about it in phone calls from my mom over the years while I was away, but now I was there. I was home with all of this happening, none of it really peaking while I was home from school (ie the primary trigger).

Over the course of my time away, my mom’s calls become this odd way of me feeling useful to my family even though I was gone. I was wanted. I would coach my mom through all this stuff she was dealing with, with my sister. I was good at reasoning through things and putting it well, for someone who was awful at dealing with their own feelings. My mom felt I was objective and it was helpful to her understanding. She kept calling, I kept answering, and my sister kept acting out. I finally got to see what my mom was talking about.

Something I didn’t expect (in hindsight, I was dumb) was for my sister’s rage and anxiety to be channeled towards me. She was aggressive and I felt I was dropped without choice into the middle of this. Every night was my sister, mother, and father shouting about school work, behavior in school, or how her car smells like pot even though they cleaned it out after she got caught by the cops again. Everyday I am getting yelled at by her, threatened, dragged into something, or listening to me being heard about. I was ammunition, a catalyst, and a target all at once. Mainly, it was my sister, but my mom would try dragging me in with the expectation I’d diffuse the situation but it never worked. All my mother’s talk of “not relying on me” hadn’t really worked. She felt like she wasn’t really and she wasn’t, but I don’t think she realized how deeply I felt the times that she did and what she did/said. 

End of sophomore year, my sister gets put into the hospital after my parents' concern peaks. She finally “detoxes” and has to confront what she’s using the weed to cope with. Don’t get me wrong, I smoke. Marijuana is great if you’re controlled with it. My sister was 16, *abusing it*, and using it to avoid actually dealing with her problems to the point it was causing her issues with cops, nearly flunking out, and getting aggressive when my parents would toss her stuff. She was using a dab rig before school in her car, hitting her pen in the bathroom, a joint while driving home, and smoking the day away in the bathroom by the window or in her car. 

My mom had a breakdown. Was she a bad parent? Was this the right thing? Is this what would finally help? At least she had one daughter that was on the “good path”, right? I comforted my mom. Talked to her about what I had hear of in-patient treatment from my friends, what I had seen during my visits to friends, and telling her what my sister needed to learn. My mom, in true fashion, threw herself into research and was trying her damned hardest to make this work. My mom always wanted things to work for us. She cared and tried. She really did. 

Sophomore to junior year, this past summer, I moved in with my boyfriend to try and take a step away from everything going on with my sister. My shot at “protecting my health” and getting out of a toxic environment for myself. We did great and I felt better than I had in awhile. The whole time I’m taking classes because I went on probation for my scholarship because of my grades. I change my career path (not major) from all the doubt. I was super nervous going into this year. I was going to be isolated in my apartment, all my 400+ level classes online, and no groups that are accepting this year. 

\[\[Now I’m here, in the fall semester of my junior year. School has been trash with teacher tech knowledge/use so I’ve had such a difficult time learning, a hard time with my accommodations being met, and the classes are just whooping my ass. I was organized, I felt better prepared but nothing could stick in my head well enough for exams. A’s on every assignment, every lab, every participation check, but my exams were pushing just too much for me to understand the content truly. I studied, I didn’t sleep, I drilled. I wanted so badly to do well… but I just *didn’t.*

I failed an exam for the first time. Not just “doing bad”, but to the point I might as well have skipped it and taken a zero. It sounds miniscule in the scheme of things, just one bad test, but it *broke* me. My grade wouldn’t recover, I would lose my scholarship, I was done. Everything I had worked for my entire life had snapped because of everything I could knit pick. My anxiety had skyrocketed and I was sobbing. I called my mom and finally unloaded on her for the first time. She had me come home for a while, wanting to see if being around family would help.

It has, to some degree. I’m trying to be positive right now, but I’m just burnt out. I don’t know where to go. My sister is applying to colleges now (17/18F) and there’s so much arguing in the house from that and hybrid schooling. My boyfriend purposely pushes my nerves to be funny and works full time, so now I get worked up even thinking over going over to just be wound up into a minor anxiety attack for a gag and be by myself from 8 pm - 6 pm. I’m doing better in school now that I really have a space to focus and that’s what I associated with my room at home, but deep down, nothing’s changed and I realized that last night.

I’m where I was in junior high, before I was even medicated. I cycle from an insomniac to fatigue/perpetual exhaustion, I’m numb, I’m puking every morning, I’m twitching all the time, and just a mess. My dad commented on my bags under my eyes for the first time. I’ve lost 15 lbs from not eating/puking. I’m just uninterested. It’s weird that I’m like that, especially because every other facet of my life is going well by normal standards.

Functionally, socially, school-wise I am starting to do better. I am going out with my friends (socially distant and all that), spending time with my family (we do have good moments), and have been doing better in school this past week than I have in a long time. I’m on meds, I’m with a better psychiatrist, my dog’s training is finishing up. I should be good. I wanted to enjoy my best friend’s 21st birthday with her family and friends partying, I wanted to enjoy my sister doing well on her SAT, I wanted to be happy that I passed my exam from Thursday. I don’t want my mom to be disappointed. I don’t want her to have two broken kids. I want to be better for her. I want to keep my scholarship. I want to have something to look forward to in life. 

I should be calm, satisfied, and happy with the direction of my life right now. I’m on an upward trend, it’s a positive. I see that. Why can I just not be happy with it? Instead, I am exhausted, apathetic to everyone/everything, and I’m just *done*. I just feel burnt out. I just want to hit a reset button on my body and not feel so tired, dull, and tense. Why do I just feel like I want to sleep and not wake up? I’ve powered through before. I should be able to handle this. I want to be able to handle this. I just really, really don’t want to. I don’t know how I could put my life on pause though to really do that. I can’t just “check out” for a week, a month, whatever. College doesn’t stop, my mom and sister’s lives don’t stop, life keeps going. I have to catch up or I’ll just slip off. Is this “burnt out”? Is that what this is? Or is this just me not keeping up? Is this me just hitting “the real world” and not being prepared enough? I’m only 20 and if this is how hard life is meant to be, I’m scared. 

I’ve spent the past hour writing this. I know the wording isn’t the best and the grammar probably isn’t strong, but I needed to get it off my chest somehow. I know I couldn’t authentically say it to anyone. That’d be too hard.\]\]

TL,DR: I’ve grown up with anxiety my entire life. My mother and I have made my entire identity around school. My sister has started dealing with social issues and severe anxiety/depression. My mother views me as a success story and I internalize that pressure. I’m struggling in school and my mental health has plummeted, but my mother is focused on my sister and I don’t want to break my mother’s expectations of me. Am I burnt out or am I just behind the “the real world”?"
Anxiety,Was anyone else like this as a child?,"So when I was younger I was a very quiet child, I never spoke in school at all to the point where the school sent me to see someone to make sure I was OK. I talked a lot at home but in school I just wanted to be invisible. As I got older I got a little bit more confident but I still hated talking in class, dreaded group work and if someone ever gave me a compliment I'd cry. I'm a little better now, I'm more talkative and can take compliments and criticism without crying but my self esteem is very low. I'm in a dead end retail job because I don't have the self confidence to apply for jobs with my degrees field. I bend over backwards for other people to make them happy and spend more time thinking about what everyone else wants. I just wanna be me, no more worrying, no more being inside my own head and confident. I just don't know where to start. I know my childhood may have had a impact on how I've developed. I was just wondering was anyone else like this as a child or even as an adult?"
Anxiety,Someone tell me it’s gonna be okay?,About to head into surgery. It’s nothing serious but I hate hospitals. I’m freaking out. On a ton of anxiety meds and my heart rate is still 120+. I’m alone and scared. Just wish I had some support or reassurance from anyone.
Anxiety,A redditor said that his death will be my fault,"In the depression forum. Redditor said he wanted to take his life for being ""ugly.""
He posted a pic and I said he looked like Nicholas Cage. Of course I meant it as a  compliment.  He replied that Cage is ugly and I'll be responsible for his (redditors) death. I'm obviously distraught over this."
Anxiety,Today I overcame my anxiety.... And after that it got worse.,"So I am super anxious of what people might think of me or how people will react to me. I also worry about basically every possible negative thing that could happen to me. I've got some super mild Form of social anxiety and some other insecuritys. I'm already in therapy and my therapist told me I need to do what I fear. 

So today I forced myself to get into situations that I'd previously would have avoided. A week ago I found a old fuked up skateboard and I have been trying out tricks in my garage since then. (cause nobody could see me in my garage). Not only am I incredibly insecure about skateboarding because of my anxiety I'm also insecure about skateboarding because I just started skating and therefore I really am bad at it. But as I said today I forced myself to do uncomfortable things. Therefore I picked up my board, went to the next big city, got into the most busy place and started to drive around. It was amazing. I never felt that confident with myself. I even crashed once but I got up, grabbed my board and went on skating with no hesitation. It was like suddenly all my anxiety was away even though I still was incredibly nervous. But at least I didn't care about what other people thought.

After that I thought to myself ""why not take it a step further"". I already wanted to buy a new board since mine is super broken and old and therefore decided to go to a nearby skate shop. After awkwardly looking around the shop I managed to speak up to a worker and ask some questions. After that I went to another skate shop and did the same thing again. I even chatted with the employee there. I really thought I changed something to the good today.

But now I'm at home and think about what I've done all day. I can't stop to cringe at myself and think about what other people thought of me. I'm like ""omg I fell down in the middle of the street the people must think I'm stupid"" or ""the employees in the skateshop probably were super annoyed with me knowing nothing about skating"".

I even told my mother that I'd like to buy a new board and go to some skateparks and she said to me that my sister used to skate and that she met some pretty bad people in the skateparks occasionally. And that she also found very bad friends there. This obviously makes me super anxious about the whole skating thing. I mean it's so much fun but because of that I'm not sure if I want to go there anymore.

It feels like I've done more harm than good to myself today. And it's so frustrating cause I really tried to better myself."
Anxiety,Work Woes,I’m a recent graduate and am on job #2 since graduating. I regret quitting job #1 and now I just want to quit job #2. I quit job #1 due to impulsivity and of course anxiety. This sucks.
Anxiety,Anxiety when Eating,"I recently have begun to feel anxious when I eat. If it's at home, and I'm not going out that day, it's not too bad, but any other circumstances I just feel sick if i eat. It sucks because as hard as it is to go out, when I do occasionally it would be good to have some food but I just can't. 

Has anyone felt the same way before? If so, did anything help?"
Anxiety,Dp/Dr,"I am having sever dp/dr and i have paranoid thoughts wich just makes me so scared of going crazy. I feel like i am having psychosis wich just makes me have crazy panic attacks. Can somebody tell me that i am not going crazy? How do i know i am not going crazy?
I have these paranoid thoughts like; is he following me and then i just dismiss it like ofcourse not. I dont really believe that this guy is following me but the thought just pops in to my head."
Anxiety,Moving out on my own,"So I recently got accepted into a small one bedroom apartment and my move in day is Wednesday. I’ve been anxious all weekend, I am 24 years old and have lived with my mom and two younger siblings. This is the first time I move out into my own place. I’m worried I won’t be able to be financially wise with my money and will struggle to it rent. I pay 3x the rent so I should be okay but I still worry. What if my truck breaks down or I get sick and can’t work or my cat gets injured and I have to take her to the vet. When I first looked into moving out I was really excited but that excitement has turned into fear. I’m all alone and have no one to ask or talk to about this. If you read all this thank you for listening. Have a great day!"
Anxiety,Anyone else want another lockdown so you don’t have to face the real world again or is it just me?,
Anxiety,struggling,I feel like i’m struggling more with my anxiety maybe because i’m back at school after lockdown but like i really do not want to have to get help because it’s terrifying to me and i hate being vulnerable and don’t want to actually know that i have a problem. i know that i should probably reach out but i am still copping it’s just gotten worse. it also doesn’t help that my parents don’t believe anything’s wrong and tell me that i’m just being stupid when i tell them i struggle. is there anything i can do to manage the anxiety on my own?
Anxiety,Feeling normal,"I'm on a streak of bad days, my anxiety has never been this bad before. I woke up feeling just as terrible as any other day.

However, today I took a short nap, which usually makes me feel worse for some reason.

Not today. I woke up from the nap being rested. The pressure in my head and chest is... just not there. My mind is not ticking on useless stuff. My situation feels okay, my room is not like a cell. I didn't catch myself clenching my jaws. I enjoyed sitting down and talking with my friends, not obsessively thinking about how bad it will be home alone after. Will it last? I don't know, but right now that just doesn't matter.

Right now I don't feel agony. I feel hungry.
Cheers."
Anxiety,I just found out something really horrible about a famous person I used to look up to and I can't stop crying. My anxiety is through the roof,[removed]
Anxiety,"Feel so overwhelmed at work, panicking","I don't know where to start, sorry if this is too much venting, I don't know what else to do.
I'm happy that I have a job right now given COVID and such. But I'm so overwhelmed at work, and being confronted by almost every customer I talk to that I'm panicking and can't relax. The field I'm in is very busy, and has a long backlog of work where it seems every customer I talk to is furious about the amount of time it takes.

Our management is aware of this, but they've been relatively dismissive for the most part. I don't know what else to do so in working much longer hours to attempt to catch up so I can give customers good news, but it's not working.

I'm really panicking about work where every night and weekend I'm just stressing about work and I'm not able to enjoy my time away.... I spent a chunk of yesterday just laying in bed panicking about going to work today. A part of me wants to leave the job, but I worry about not being able to afford rent if I do.

Sorry for venting, just not sure what to do, and feel on the verge of a break down..."
Anxiety,Really tough day today,"I've been ill for a couple of days, probably just a bad cold but feeling really rough with it. A fever, headache and really worn out. Awaiting results of a covid swab. My DH has been really helpful and taken on most of the care of our baby today to give me a rest but he can't tomorrow as he has to work (although it's working from home he has to be in another part of the house all day and his absence would be non negotiable despite his best efforts). I've been feeling really tearful all day worrying about how I'll cope with the baby the way I'm feeling, and then worried if I'll make the baby poorly too by passing on whatever I have. Maybe it's the fever but I feel like I'm having a sort of out of body anxiety experience, you know where time slows down? I just feel so overwhelmed. Not sure what I am after here but maybe just a hand hold or a head pat? Someone to say it'll be okay. We can't ask friends to help as we're still waiting for the covid results. And we have no local family. I just need a hug from my mum :("
Anxiety,My voice gives me away,"No matter how confident I act, when I’m the least bit nervous my voice gets really shaky.

I do a lot of presentations to other work colleagues. Everyone can tell I’m nervous because my voice shakes/wobbles when I say something. I really can’t control it.

I know everyone says you get more confident the more you do something but I’ve always had a shaky voice when nervous as long as I can remember and I’ve been doing presentations for my job for a while now.

I really like my job and it’s only one aspect of it but I feel really embarrassed when everyone can see I’m nervous which obviously doesn’t help."
Anxiety,I’m afraid to go outside alone,"So just about two maybe three weeks ago I was walking my dog and this car was following me and I posted it my story on Reddit and people agreed I wasn’t being too paranoid (i still haven’t gone on a walk since that incident). I was just working out in front of my house because I had to move it outside because it was hot inside and I was paranoid seeing cars pass by. There was this one truck that passed by twice and I was afraid and ended up cutting my workout short and went inside. 
I have no clue how to beat this, I feel like I’m gonna have a breakdown like something terrible is gonna happen."
Anxiety,Im always tired and stressed out,"I feel like I can pass out during the day but at night im wide awake. I cant sleep well, my minds thinking a lot of stuff that I can no longer organize my thoughts. Its like my minds scanning everything so fast that i cant keep up. I wana sleep but i cant."
Anxiety,I messed up at work and it’s eating me,"I messed up at work, computer mistake. I think I covered it but I’m so anxious someone will go back and see. It’s ruined my whole day and I’ve kinda crawled into a ball."
Anxiety,I TALKED!,"I participated in a group discussion today.  I only talked once but I am still really proud. I am waiting for my body to calm down, my muscles and head are still achy and I am never very fatigued, but some progress is still progress!!!"
Anxiety,Stuck in a Circle,"Lately I’ve been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep and as a result I have been more tired and anxious during the day. It doesn’t help that I am now also getting anxious about whether or not I will sleep well at night which just makes it worse. 

In the past when I’ve had this I just eventually get so tired that I manage to somehow end up in my usual sleep schedule again, but I’m willing to admit that there are probably better ways to handle this. 

Has anyone else dealt with this and any suggestions or things that have worked for you? Any help/advice is greatly appreciated :)"
Anxiety,"For those who have experienced both, would you rather feel anxious or depressed?","So I’m someone who has always had anxiety and OCD but this summer -with the combination of a few different things- the anxiety got so bad to the point that I believe it led to my depression. 

I understand that anxiety and depression are unfortunately sometimes two sides of the same coin but for those who’ve experienced both at the clinical level, what would you “prefer” to feel. Honestly, I think depression. At least the depression doesn’t come with panic attacks constantly and irrational fear and worry all of the time."
Anxiety,Plant Patch with Lexapro?,"Hi y’all, 

I’ve been recently (the last 4 to 5 months) taking lexapro but I have started to have issues with sleeping and wanted to see if anyone knew if a patch with melatonin, hops and valerian root would interact in a negative way with lexapro? It’s supposed to release slowly so that it can help with sleeping. 

There are a few others that I would love to know if anyone knew the interactions too but for now this is the most important one."
Anxiety,how to i just... cope with my anxiety?,"okay so i started a chapter of this nonprofit for orphans !! yay i’m helping people!! they wanted me to plan a toys drive to donate to this other organization— wow i am NOT used to being a leader and this is giving me so much anxiety

i’m legitimately shaking and not able to breathe for the past 3 days just from awaiting emails. this is my first time being the top dog of something— and i very much prefer being one of the worker bees. i cant focus for more than 20 minutes at a time without compulsively going onto my phone and mindlessly scrolling trying to just calm down. also: living with your trauma [mother] is not fun !! i’m getting panic attacks from hearing her voice again and overall i’m just so anxious :(

yknow whats even better ? one of my triggers for dissociating is anxiety attacks !! whoo !! i’m in a very bad dissociating episode (?) right now where i can’t recognize who i am in the mirror and just see my body as a mere vessel. my soul is screaming to get out right now and i literally can’t take it because everything looks so saturated and i’m starting to not be able to perceive texture again

i just feel so lost and afraid !! and planning the toys drive is not helping— especially because i derive much of my pleasure from being a workaholic.. this compulsive scrolling is not helping me to do my work"
Anxiety,anxiety tics,"recently i went back to school and that’s really caused my anxiety to flair up. as well as having many panic attacks in lessons and stuff, i’ve been experiencing these kind of tics. i say tics, i’m not completely sure. most of the time it’s really minor, just some twitching and hand movements, but other times it can be violent. it goes anywhere from shouting to hitting myself or others. and it doesn’t happen all the time, which makes me think it might not be tics. i cant really stop myself from doing this. i don’t have a lot of knowledge on this, as you can probably tell from this post. does anyone else experience this when they get really anxious? is it tics or could it be something else? any advice would be appreciated :)"
Anxiety,"At this point I feel physical pain because of all the stress, please help me make it stop","Why this never ends, it's like I'm in panic mode 24/7. I'm in my early 20's feel like I've aged 30 years during the last year. This rapid heartbeat, chest pain, void in head is always here. I can distract myself for few minutes but then suddenly it's hitting back with full force.

I've developed some medical issues with surprisingly lot of body parts, hard classes at university are back, I'm struggling to find real ""career"" job because I'm unable to concentrate anymore, I distanced myself from all friends, my family is a bit abusing.

Half of my mind don't see point anymore and stopped caring about anything, the other half is constantly stressing me about it.

I can't make any adult decision, even when I think about making one I get this scary ""falling from a chair/missing a step on stairs"" feeling.

Therapy doesn't help, meds are making me sleep and not wanting to ever wake up."
Anxiety,"So, a guy I like (never met before), is coming to see me in a week. HELP!",I have severe severe anxiety. I’m so nervous for him to come and see me. No one I know can give me solid advice. What do I do? Any advice appreciated.
Anxiety,Anxiety from calling out of work sick; I think my anxiety is what’s causing me to feel sick,"Yesterday I left work early because I was feeling so terrible. I have had a chronic headache for 5 days that wouldn’t go away, and I just felt fatigued. I figured it was a safe bet to go home and not risk my health and that of my co workers and customers. I decided to get tested for COVID to be safe, and I’m still waiting on results so I had to call out again today until I get my results. I was so riddled with anxiety yesterday because I was so scared about what my managers and co-workers were saying about my leaving. (Keep in mind that I work for an amazing company who always puts their employees first. We are known for being treated very well and for being very friendly). 

Does this happen to anyone else, and if so how do you make yourself feel better? I’m still so anxious today worrying about how it looks that I’ve called out, because I’m in the process of being promoted. 

I know that I need to put myself first, but I’m feeling better today and am starting to think that my sickness was from being so stressed. 

TL;DR:  feeling anxious and guilty for calling out of work."
Anxiety,Who else struggles with change to routine and others being in your space?,"I’m trying to find a solution to help me cope with both of these issues but I’ve really been struggling. My partners friend is currently living at ours until he moves into his own place and I’m really struggling with having someone there 24/7 (minus when he’s at work) and just cannot adapt to it. It’s been 2 weeks and I’m still getting really anxious of an evening and just feel like I can’t be myself. I hate others knowing about my anxiety so I always try and distance myself but then worry he’ll think I’m rude or don’t want him there etc. 

I’ve drastically changed my routine to try and avoid him and it’s making me go back to bad anxiety habits I had previously broken. 

What do you guys usually do in these situations. I can’t read as I’m far too fidgety and can’t take in the words, and reading has always been my escape."
Anxiety,Unable to do anything .,"I can't work on personal projects or goals because my anxiety is causing me to freeze up. It used to be the opposite, whenever I was really anxious my body would force me to do the thing. WTF HAPPENED?! Does this happen to anyone here and what should I do?"
Anxiety,(Possible trigger warning?) Needed to spill the beans a little. Very long post inside.,"So I don't know where to begin really. I have always ""lurked"" around reddit and rarely post. Definitely not something so personal. I feel the anxious energy just tapping this out shakingly. For a really long time I have fought anxiety exhaustingly. For as long as I can remember I can recall the tremble in my arms, my chest, the weakness in my legs. Overall the hysteria in my head at times. I'll spare the finer points, for fear of over-sharing. Most recently I have found what may be my lowest point. Or maybe my biggest obstacle. Three months or so ago I left a really stable job, that I began to loathe on a particular level. The pandemic hit, and my co-workers and I slogged through day by day. It all became a lot to bear. Too much in fact. I left and reconnected with my father. Who I have been estranged with for... my entire life really. 

I wanted to reach him you know? Tell him what I struggled with. My anxiety, my current bout of depression. Feeling lost. Above all my issues with him, ultimately the impact his absence affected me. He quickly shot me down, and emotionally strong armed me. It hurt, a lot. But I understood he only wished to connect with me to absolve himself on his ""death bed"" it still gets to me honestly. I never really opened up to anyone in my life. For fear of rejection. Or the anxiety in and of itself trying to explain what I feel. Often I just soldiered through it. Kept my head down, dropped out of highschool. Sought out finishing school alone. Got myself a job with the help of incredible counselor. Alas, all of those moments themselves were slowly, but more often cataclysmicly self destructed through my anxiety. The stress. The weight. 

Fast forward to my most recent episode. I guess you could call it that? A job I had set up in late July took ages to come together. Eventually I made it to my first shift in late August. Moving to a completely new place a few cities over. My immediate manager my first day seemed to be a little abrasive to me. Just not a gentle person. But I tried not to put too much thought into it. The day languidly stuttered on. And I survived the shift. The next week was filled with silence. Due to a supplier not being able to ship a certain product. Business stuff much out of my scope of know how or relative interest even. I got a call the next Monday and was told I would not be needed any longer. 

I was distraught, filled with this dread. Like I was smothered by a wet three hundred pound blanket. A new city, bills, rent, unemployment. People everywhere, the great big wide unknown. I just lost the plot. Slowly but surely. I couldn't make it to interviews that I had scheduled. My partner had started a new job and began having to travel. Sometimes a week at a time. And I was stuck in this appartment. Peering outside and being frustrated being unable to leave the house. Every time I made an attempt, the monster in the back of my head would shout. I would freeze up, I would panic. I would collapse under the weight of it all. I finally took the precarious step toward help. For the first time in my life I reached out to a doctor. She was so nice, I didn't know how to handle it. I started on my first medication. Sertraline and it has been a war to try and understand it, to try not to let the anxiety tear me away from help. I finally got to the 3 week marker. And scheduled my follow-up. The finish line! Or so I had really hoped. The next doctor I saw, was just as friendly. Funny too. We talked for forty five minutes. Now maybe she just didn't have a lot going on, just killed time with me. But it was nice to connect. To have warmth, seemingly understanding. 

But in that conversation she told me, she felt my perscription may not be the right fit. We would ween me off of this drug that has been a horror show to get onto. And start another. I was crushed. And I'm left anxious and dreading the navigation of this. I'm sorry for such a long post. I guess I just needed to vent. Let all of the grime out. Thank you if you took the time to read this. It means a lot to me. 

tldr; I have agoraphobia and it hit me like a mac truck. Struggling really hard with what feels like a whole new level of anxiety."
Anxiety,Anyone else feel constantly anxious around people?,"Pretty much all my life I’ve been uncomfortable, nervous and anxious around people. For example - coworkers, friends of friends, S/O family, etc. So I end up coming off awkward or rude. Even when i’m around people I see often I still can’t shake the anxiety. I guess I never really see or hear anyone that talks about that kind of anxiety. 

Wanted to know if anyone else shares this"
Anxiety,"Stuck in a vicious cycle, advice needed?","So here’s the deal,

I donate plasma for extra money and there hasn’t been an issue until about a week ago.

Last week I went in to donate and my pulse was a bit too high, so I waited 15 minutes before they let me try again. I got really nervous and my pulse was even high and I got turned away for the day.

I’ve tried six time in the last week to pass, I’ve failed every single time. I’m in a vicious cycle, I’m able to keep it low at home and on the bus to the plasma place, but as soon as I go into the exam room it skyrockets. I’ve tried Dramamine, Serotonin, CBD oil, keeping my feet flat on the ground, deep breathing, nothing works. 

Any advice? The plasma place said it would be fine if I took medication to lower my heart rate and blood pressure, but I don’t have insurance, so I might not be able to get any.

Any advice on how to break this cycle?"
Anxiety,I think I had an anxiety attack,"Last night I was doing some work and suddenly I felt an irresistible itch in my scalp, it was so strong that I was almost going mad over it. I then asked my Mom to help me oil my it. The itch subsided but then I could feel my heart pounding and I had a feeling of nervousness and fear. I measured my Blood Pressure then and it turned out to be 155/80. I later took some BP regulatory medicines and was laying down and then suddenly I burst into tears. I felt as if my life has been shit and I have never been happy I just wanted to cry and cry and cry. i don't know what's happening with me. Can anyone please help me?"
Anxiety,"I’m terrified that something bad is going to happen. I don’t know what, but I’m scared of it anyway.","I’m happy. I am actually happy.  
  
I graduated last year and I have a job in my field. My volunteer work in tutoring kids with special needs is starting back up again. I live with my kind, loving boyfriend and our beautiful little cat.  
  
I want to be thankful, and I kind of am, but I’m scared that something bad will happen because how can the world just allow me to be happy?"
Anxiety,Has the pandemic made anyone else scared of going outside at all?,"Like I know objectively that chances of transmission outside are extremely low. But I am terrified to go outside for a walk. I feel like I am so nervous because of the anti-maskers in my area. Every time I go anywhere where a mask is required, I see at least one douchebag who is apparently happy to infect the whole world with their gross breath lol. So I feel like I am so distrusting of the people around since. 

But I really should go out and get some sun and exercise. Help?"
Anxiety,I asked a guy for his snapchat today!,"Social interactions, especially those with strangers, scare me shitless. Making a move on a complete stranger is something I’d never do. But today was different. This guy had the most contagious smile; it was comforting, really. So, I decided to go up to him and ask for his snap. He actually ended up saying no as he has a girlfriend, but it, surprisingly, didn’t even phase me. This is so unlike me dude, I avoid situations like this at all costs, but I did it easily. And him rejecting me would typically be something to take a toll on my breathing, make my face all hot and red, etc. but we both laughed it off and I walked away. I don’t even recognize myself today (in the best way possible!) I just feel really good about this and thought I’d share:-)"
Anxiety,"Just for today, do not worry","&gt;*If you think about what worry is, it’s a jump into the future where we create all sorts of scenarios and catastrophise about all the terrible things that can happen*

Anxiety,Everytime I get an anxiety attack it feels like a heart attack,"I sleep a lot because just to not feel it. People think I’m lazy or I’m exaggerating, my boyfriend used to help me with it but now he says he doesn’t have the energy anymore and it hurts. When I get anxiety attacks they usually lasts for days. If they’re really bad I’ll even puke and then eating becomes a scary thing for me. It also makes my thoughts spiral and I hate it I just want it to go away. Sometimes I just want to rip my heart out so I won’t feel any of it. I have to hide it too which makes me feel lonely.

I’ll delete this soon but I just wanted to write how I felt and maybe someone will listen"
Anxiety,Anyone else ever dread that they may die a violent death even when your not in a place that is any danger to you at that time?,
Anxiety,Waking up cold and shivering?,"Hi there! I’ve dealt with many anxiety symptoms before but lately I’ve been waking up with my body shivering, increased heart rate, confused, and feeling quite cold. I also haven’t been able to sleep very well because of this which doesn’t help my anxiety during the day. Has anyone had similar symptoms/experience and how were you able to deal with it? I had bloodwork done about a month  ago and thankfully I’m completely healthy so I wanted to know if I should go back and get more studies done of if it really is just my anxiety and lack of sleep. 
Thank y’all for your responses in advanced!"
Anxiety,"Excessive swallowing,jaw pain.","Anyone else have problems with excessive swallowing to the point where your mouth is dry and then you try to swallow again and feel like you're going to choke on your own saliva?This is really scare.Cause if I try to eat any food during this time it scares me out.

Also anyone having jaw pain because of anxiety?I'm jaw pain on one side on the front.Now I'm really worried whether the jaw pain is due to something else.Im a hypochondriac so slightest of the things is worrying too much."
Anxiety,I think I made it!,"Look.... I’ve still got a long way to go, but I’ve been steadily getting better. Today feels like the pinnacle, the top of Everest, that place I thought I’d ever get to.

My anxiety journey started 5 months ago. Due to stress at work and at home, I started having little panic attacks over the space of the year before which got stronger and stronger, longer and longer. Until one day just before picking the kids up from school, I had a full blown meltdown type panic attack, the walls were closing in, my chest tight, my heart pounding, my stomach, nauseous. I had my little girl with me and I tried with every fibre in my body to not let her see I was struggling. I got to the school, as dizzy as a drunk elephant and I phoned my partner, my first words in think I’m dying’ 

I finally collected the kids in a hurry hoping the teachers wouldn’t see how mental I was and try to section me. I got home, my mother in law arrived and I just broke down in want to be normal’ I kept saying. I finally calmed down, but spent the next 24hours expecting an imminent attack. They came but went quite quickly. I agreed to go to the doctor.

The next day I get to the surgery have the chat with the doctor, he prescribed me anti depressants. I also have bloods done and an ecg as I have been convinced since my childhood I was going to have an heart attack.

All was fine but I had high cholesterol, great! I have to worry about that now. I wanted to take my anti depressants in the morning, by now this was late afternoon. My mother, who is also on AD’s told me take one that night and then in the morning and go from there. My god do I think that was the biggest mistake of my life. The next evening I had the mother of all panic attacks, I couldn’t calm down, it lasted for 36 hours and a trip to A &amp; E. I was checked over and given some diazepam. I got home popped one and slept for what felt like a year.

After I woke up I felt like my nervous system was on fire, my body was buzzing and vibrating and I had racing thoughts, thoughts of harming my family, suicidal feelings, hopelessness, scared and fearful feeling.

This went on for months, I thought I was going crazy, I’d started a new job which was much less stressful, but it was so hard when I had all of this going on, everyday was a struggle and right in the middle of lockdown in the UK. I prayed that everyday, I could just get to 7pm and get into bed with my partner, where I felt safe but still had these horrible things happening. Every day I prayed I would wake up and be back to my old self, everyone kept saying, the tablets will make you worse before you get better. 

I tried everything, I taught myself CBT techniques, meditation, exercise, yoga, diet, supplements, NoFap. Nothing worked! If anything it made them worse. I constantly felt like I had an electric prod, plugged in to my central nervous system, I was a wreck.  How I got through those days, I still don’t know. The suicidal thoughts increased (I have never had one suicidal thought in my life). I was convinced I had a range of disorders. Psychosis, ptsd (I do have this after my sister was murdered 5 years ago) depression, gad, panic disorder, hocd etc.

I came off the tablets roughly 6 weeks ago after I tapered myself. I started at 50mg and after 3 weeks, told my gp I think they’re making me worse, he upped them to 100mg. I was hopeful at the time but boy do I regret it! After another month, I told him it wasn’t working, he wanted to up them to 150mg, not again mate! I suggested tapering off, he strongly suggested against it. I knew my body, it was screaming to get this poison out of me! 

I tapered off over a 3 week period. I should have taken longer, but I wanted them gone. Boy we’re the Ssri withdrawal Forums right. Everything multiplied the first few weeks. But I slowly started getting better, and yes I know, looking back it was the AD’s making my anxiety worse. I really feel like if I hadn’t kept up the meditation, yoga, exercise, supplements etc. I would still be in that horrible place. I also drink a lot of teas which have helped, redbush, camomile, lemon and ginger. 

I wrote this as I think if I had seen a post like this when I was in the midst of it I think I would have cried with joy."
Anxiety,Help?,"I just got In a Relationship with his girl and when we got off the phone last night and tonight so she could go to bed I saw hours later that she was still active. I messaged her she didn't look at it and about three minutes later it said that she was active three minutes ago.
Is my anxiety getting the best of me or should I actually be worried I haven't brought it up to her.
Sorry if this sounds dumb or if I'm over reacting Im just worried"
Anxiety,Medicstion help,"I dont know if this is the right sub for this, but ive begun taking Kalms (mild anxiety meds, best i can get without my parents knowing) and i was wondering, since google cant tell me, is it safe to combine the one-a-day lavender kalms with the regular kalms day? They seem to contain different things, so i was wondering if they were safe together for a bit more help. Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but idk where to put it (if its wrong, please point me in the right direction)"
Anxiety,I want to be a Dental Hygienist or Nurse but...,I have bad anxiety and get nervous around people. Are there any Nurses or Dental Hygienists on here that can give me advice? I’d greatly appreciate it!
Anxiety,"I have a crush on my friend, don’t think I came on too strong, and I’m worried I’m being ignored.",Which is weird because I thought we had good vibes before this. Help I texted her something heartfelt but....
Anxiety,Help,"“I have no idea why, but ever since I was a kid I have felt like a threat to others. I obviously, would never harm anybody. But I could always vision myself doing something horrible”- my friend has confided in me, and told me this. She has asked me to keep it anonymous, but she wants to figure out what’s wrong. It’s scaring her. She would never hurt a fly, so she has no idea why she has all these horrible thoughts about doing bad stuff to people. Is this a disorder or something?"
Anxiety,Anxiety about things that already didn’t happen?,"Does anyone else get anxiety about things that already didn’t happen?! Like I’ll think of an event from the past and get anxiety thinking about what might have happened if things had gone differently? For example one time my flight got cancelled and my phone battery was really low but luckily I still managed to call someone to come pick me up from the airport, but sometimes if I think about it I’ll get a wave of dread thinking “what if my phone had died what would have happened!” and I’ll imagine this fake scenario where I’m stranded at the airport even though it literally turned out fine?!"
Anxiety,I feel like it will never go away,"My anxiety manifests and takes over my entire life. I put myself first but in the worst ways, that I can’t see when to make time for friends or family or loved ones. 

I’m constantly worried about school and being perfect. I’m worried about scoring perfect on the GRE. I’m always worried. Constantly, whether I get drunk or high I’m still worried. Even with my medication, I’m worried.

I feel like if I don’t accomplish what I wanted in life on the first try I’m a failure. All this money spent for nothing. What’s the use if I’m not constantly perfect? God I need help, I need so much help. This is going to consume me and end up killing me. Whether by my own hand or the physical harm done by the stress I endure. 

Please don’t let me be a failure."
Anxiety,Mental health,"Hey everyone,
Reddit is a safe space so here i go.
I have noticed,
 if there is a conversation that i am a part of but currently doing something else. My mind tends to subconsciously keep thinking about the conversation that might or might not be going on!
This problem hinders my ability to focus on the task i am currently doing, and i until i go and see the what was going on my mind won't attain peace ( not sure why).
So the outline of my problem is subconsciously my minds wanders into things that may or may not exist which hinders my work and ability to focus.
What do you guys think i should do and does that mean i am mentally weak?!"
Anxiety,Anxiety attacks,I hear a lot of ppl say when they get anxiety attacks there muscles tighten and they nearly start to cry but for me I just get awful pains in my heart a few palps maybe skipped beats to and u feel like I’m choking on air. Awfully scary when lying in bed and they seem to come for no reason my anxiety is mainly physical and I feel I could beat it but I don’t know what’s causing it like I’m an outgoing person definitely don’t have social anxiety but my anxiety is constantly worsening. Can anyone relate to emitter of these points?
Anxiety,Avoiding music because the musicians are more talented,"As the title said. I'm happy listening to songs where somebody plays 4 chords (I play guitar as a hobby) but when I listen to songs that I feel are ""above me"" (I love heavy metal and they're always shredding solos) I just feel this instant wave of depression and anxiety that I'll never be ""enough"" for anything.
Does anybody else feel this way? 
This post is probably better off in a depression thread but I'm relatively new so forgive me on that one."
Anxiety,Should I quit my job?,"Hi all,
I've had the most crippling anxiety I've ever had this year. I've been unable to leave the house without having an anxiety attack (sweating, nausea, shaking, dissociating etc etc).
I am supposed to return to my retail job in 3 days (after being furloughed for 6 months) and I am absolutely terrified. I would love to be able to work but my physical symptoms and literally unbearable, I cant imagine myself walking into work and not having some sort of breakdown 

Now here's where I'm quite lucky, I'm also going back to uni in October and I'm in the UK so I get a maintenance loan, which will cover all my living expenses and leave me with some money leftover. I'm just worried come the summer I'll need a job again and wont be able to find one. 

I'm also worried about actually quitting my job, that seems more terrifying than actually sticking it out, does anyone have any advice or anything? I just feel incredibly stuck and alone"
Anxiety,How do i stop overthinking everything,My anxiety hasnt gotten so bad that i overthink the smallest possible interactions. I’ve even started having worse intrusive thoughts that i have absolutely no control over and it feels like someone else is controlling me. I feel so bad for everyone around me including my bf for being this way but i dont know any coping mechanisms that will work for me i just want the thoughts to stop :/
Anxiety,Post on Reddit triggered me badly :/,"I feel dumb posting that title because in my head I just thought “stop being so weak.” But I’m really struggling. 

Anyway, there was a YSK post that was basically like “if you are itchy for no apparent reason, it could be cancer” and it went into this person’s experience with lymphoma. With comments from other people confirming their experience with it. It sent me into a huge panic attack, and I’ve been psychosomatically itchy ever since, and I’m really struggling. 

Before reading that post, I got all my moles checked because one in particular on my arm was giving me anxiety (and my arm hurt the week before the appointment, which automatically went away after the doctor reassured me the mole was fine. Which confirms that the arm pain was psychological because I haven’t had it since). 

The doctor checked all my moles and said they were fine. There was one in particular that my doctor said was “perfectly round” and definitely fine. The doctor gave me some guidelines on when to be concerned about a mole, one including “if it gets itchy.” 

I have dry, itchy skin in general. I was scratching near the “perfectly round” mole, and scratching over the mole area felt different than scratching the rest of my skin. Which, sent me into a panicky downward spiral. 

And then I read the reddit post. 

And now I’ve been itchy in that area on and off ever since. 99% of the time I’m not itchy on that mole, just in some vague area near it. I know it’s in my head because it was triggered by that post. I just want the sensation to turn off like my arm pain did.

I almost want to delete reddit because it’s not the first time I’ve been triggered by a post. But then there’s subs like this that are really helpful. Idk what to do. The initial post was on “wholesome” because of how the person’s cancer was in remission. Then I saw their YSK post. Like how tf am I supposed to know what subs are triggers and what to unfollow when a trigger was on the wholesome subreddit?!! Like fuck. 


TL;DR: post on Reddit about cancer has made me have psychosomatic symptoms and I’m really struggling. I know that they are psychosomatic because I’ve had psychosomatic symptoms in the past that went away instantly after having doctor confirmation that I was fine. I’m struggling with the current set of psychological symptoms. 

For what it’s worth, I am seeing a therapist. My original one retired, so I have an initial onboarding appointment with a new one coming up."
Anxiety,We went to the beach with my parents today,I was so anxious i did not enjoy that at all it feels like evry people is judging me i hate them.
Anxiety,"sorry if this is kind of stupid but, I really need to call #PMT for my Verizon wireless plan thing to put in a refill card but im way too scared to. is it an actual person or is it a machine on the other end?",
Anxiety,i forgave myself for binge eating!!!,
Anxiety,notice the physical signs!,"i don’t know about you guys but my anxiety has evolved to just a lot of disossocation and it’s the worst! my therapist always recommends noticing the physical signs and calming yourself down. like breathing through your chest, pulling your legs close to your body (trying to make yourself smaller), temperature changes, etc. and once you notice them remind yourself that you are not in danger and that you are safe!!!!"
Anxiety,Nausea every day,"every night And every morning when i wake up i have to throw up , i have acid reflux so i used to only have sore throat in the morning but now i have nausea for the past 2 weeks"
Anxiety,Confused if my boyfriend ever found me attractive when we met ?,"Guys I know this sounds insecure asf, I don’t know why it started out of no where in my thoughts. I have anxiety but I never have had this type !! So please don’t judge if sound like an idiot.

So I take allot photos for Instagram and I remember I used to get inspo from girls that looked similar to me . So I remember when me and my bf first starting dating I was asking him if particular photos of these models look good as in their style (so I would know if the style or hair would suit me) 
Anyways he would be like “yeah it would suit u but idk cause she not my type” (btw there was actually a misunderstanding the first few times because he thought I was asking about the model when I was asking about the style, I never implied “hey babe is the model hot”, lol I’m actually scared to ever do that and wouldn’t have the guts to ask nor would I wanna know ) 
Anyways I cleared it up. And that misunderstanding was gone. 

I never really over thought about what he said. Cause I mean it just never got to me. I didn’t care cause he loves me. 
Also his celeb crush is someone that looks similar to me (some youtuber girl apart of those couple channels) similarly to some other YouTube/ celeb crushes he has. But there was something that would bother me. Like when we would watch their YouTube videos sometimes he would be like “babe she used be my biggest crush but your like a better looking version of her”. Idk why like i didn’t care or wanna know. This actually made me less confident. And the thing is I never ever asked him to compare me.
So I know he’s definitely attracted to me now but Idk why I’m just not sure if he was before ? So it’s weird cause this whole stupid worry didn’t start until 2 weeks ago when he was on Instagram and was like “ damn babe this looks like u “ which is weird cause they look so similar to the models I showed him. Anyways i was like okay. I think he even showed me the one that he said wasn’t his “type”. But I didn’t care. 

Until this morning in my random thoughts,  why this was the first time I ever felt anxious about this. And weird I ended up actually having insecure thoughts. I then started thinking what if the girls that he actually liked were just altered barbie versions of me ? Like what if that’s what he wanted to me to look like. Maybe he was being sarcastic when saying “ I looked better” I can’t blame him, I mean we all can be attracted to other people. Idk wtf is wrong me these past 2 weeks. 
So I was kinda quiet for a few days. It’s not his fault. It’s my stupid thought that started out of no where. So it wasn’t until I confronted him in a nice way and bought it up which I struggled to. 
He immediately looked extremely shocked and started explaining that I’m taking it the wrong way, he mentioned that when he mentioned a particular model wasn’t his type (during the misunderstanding) he just meant specific features model had which were different to mine or some I showed him , he didn’t think looked like me at all. 

I felt sooo bad cause I’m not the type of girl to ever do this. I mentioned idk why I was feeling insecure and he cleared that up too and apologised for showing me the model but obviously it wasn’t his fault!! 
I feel like maybe it was my fault for the whole misunderstanding we had. Like I swear I never showed him those photos to test him to anything!! That wasn’t my intention at all. 
He comforted me and ensured I’m worrying way too much. He also apologised for the comparing and said he actually wasn’t being sarcastic and just thought he was hyping me up. And has told me he wouldn’t do it again. I just ensured him that he can compliment me just as me aha.
So we solved it guys. 

But idk why even tho I’m getting better i still feel a bit anxious that I probably enabled this but I had no intention to! I haven’t taken any photo the past 2-3 weeks :/ I just feel so weird.
Also guys just to be clear when we dated it was more our connection and vibe so please don’t think he’s a dickhead or anything. He’s an amazing boyfriend and apologised. Other than this incident we are very good! 
It’s just me honestly, I don’t wanna ever have that anxiety feeling again. Just need some tips on how to manage this type of anxiety"
Anxiety,Is it okay?,Hey guys is it okay to take 10mg citalopram in the morning and then another 10mg at night ?
Anxiety,"Does anyone else with anxiety and ADHD constantly open apps/Netflix to stop thinking, only to get bored/distracted within twenty seconds leaving you with the anxiety you started with and seemingly no way to evade it",
Anxiety,Boyfriend not talking to me because of his depression. Not sure how much longer I can cope.,"My boyfriend has depression and stopped taking his meds four weeks ago. He’s been slowly getting worse since then. He kept saying he was going to go back to the doctors but didn’t. The last few days he has been pretty much ignoring me. I sent him a message saying night and that I love him and he just puts night he won’t say I love you back and it’s killing me. 

Apart form doing streaks on Snapchat he’s not talking to me at all. He lives with his grandparents so when I got up this morning I messaged his gran and explained the situation. She said she didn’t realise he wasn’t taking his meds and thanked me so much for letting her know. They booked him an emergency doctors appointment and he went this morning I presume. I kinda feel guilty though like I went behind his back. His gran said she wouldn’t mention the message to him.

At this point I don’t know what to do. His grandparents said he’s been off with them too and I know he was funny with his sister when I was around the other day. I bumped into his mum yesterday and even she said he is in one of his “grumps”. Still keep thinking I’ve done something wrong and some how this is all my fault. I did ask him if I upset him and he said no. He’s still coming on Facebook a lot so he obviously isn’t ignoring everyone. He’s talking to someone and he’s playing video games and posting on his story about stuff he’s doing so seems happy enough so my head goes to it just being me he doesn’t want to talk to. I don’t know how much longer I can cope with this though. I can’t sleep, can’t eat. I’m starving and exhausted but just feel sick to my stomach. Just keep switching from feeling numb and crying my eyes out."
Anxiety,"I don’t really know how to manage this COVID crisis, apparently.","It seems to most people around me (and now to me as well) that I have an exaggerated and a somatic response to COVID. I’ve had, in varying degrees but almost permanently throughout at least 3 months, throat pain. I’ve had two negative COVID results, after which, each time, I thought I relaxed for a bit and went away, but then it always came back with strength. I consulted a regular physician and took antibiotics for the regular throat pain fueling diseases out there, like the common flu (it’s winter here right now). But nothing: it persists. 
I have what some believe to be exaggerated cleaning habits, but I do see people, respecting protocols. Yet there are unmanageable instances. For example, (this one is manageable, but many are not) last night a friend talked without masks (I didn’t have mine either, since we were having dinner) just too close to my face. So now I feel like I have to start a strict 14-day quarantine because it was a risky situation... and because I have a sore throat again (since right after she talked to me this way). It was rough to realize, as well, I wasn’t able to ask her to step back (she was showing me photos on her phone for some long minutes), as I just couldn’t found the words to say it,l without feeling it was kind of violent; to me it was a very uncomfortable situation. Another factor to add to the mix.
The point is: I feel like this basically every time I’m around people; I make deep cleaning of my house anytime anybody enters, I’ve had not one but two tests so far ( I might add I’m the only person I know who has had a test at all, and for most of my acquaintances thats true as well). 
I know my friend shouldn’t talk to me so close, I know I and everyone else can effectively catch COVID in multiple ways, but the thing is I’m living in a somehow paranoid state of mind that can’t be good. I might add I’ve started acupuncture, which hasn’t  been of much use so far, and that I’m doing therapy, but my therapist hasn’t really dived in this aspect -not that I’ve brought it up much though, I didn’t think it was something worth mentioning much until now, when I realize each minor posible transgression triggers both a renewed paranoia and my throat pain. Well, this is just a rant, I understand this is difficult for all of humanity. Thanks for reading."
Anxiety,(potential trigger) realising the effects of social media,"I've been visiting my psychologist since February for OCD and Anxiety and I made so much progress over the course of the last 6 months, and for the first time in so long, I could actually catch a break from my mind and feel good. But I just saw a TikTok of someone who was feeling low and I started to remember how that felt and how much I suffered in that time, and instantly, it was like 6 months of progress had immediately been erased. I feel so shit for no reason and I haven't felt this low in so long. I just want a break.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be confused about why trigger warnings were necessary but I absolutely understand now. I think it's time to take a break from Instagram and Tiktok."
Anxiety,Work pressures and coping mechanisms,"I work a desk job which has short deadlines and ruthless expectations. While I want to quit this job, I can't do it at the moment due to the pandemic.

Till the time I can bid this hell good bye, I would like to know how do you generally cope with work stress and anxiety.

I have reached the stage where every work call gives me anxiety. One day it got so bad that I collapsed due to exhaustion. Then while I was on the ground, the boss called again. I picked up and he started telling me what work he wants me to do. I felt utterly broken. I've been working weekends since 2 months. With very few days of rest and relaxation. It's taking its toll on me and making me feel deporsonized. I feel like I'm someone else just living in an alien body. It's crushing me.

How do you cope with all this?

I try meditation, deep breathing, cardio exercises. But overall it hasn't helped much."
Anxiety,Covid anxiety,So for the last 2-3 days my throat has felt dry and itchy not so much hurting. And that’s the only symptom I have as of right now. How common is this as a first symptom? I’m 22 and terrified I will die of covid.
Anxiety,What is wrong with me? Need advice,"So i’m a 18 y/o girl and I really get tense around people I know, I don’t have lots of friends but when I meet with my friends or my relatives I just get tense, even sometimes my hands are starting to shake for no reason??? I cant even think properly. When meeting is over I’m overthinking about everything I said and did like ‘What I just said was stupid or not?’ ‘Do they think that I’m cringy and weird?’ And there is no reason for me to think like this bc nothing ever happens and no one says anything about me. I’m just thinking a lot about what people are thinking about me even I don’t like them.
Its like everyone is judging me.
Quarantine was like a hell for me because of overthinking.How can I stop this and relax?

Sorry for my bad english btw"
Anxiety,I desperately need someone to talk to.,"I am evacuated from my town from a serious natural disaster. I'm in one of the biggest cities in the US temporarily by myself for now. I am so stressed out because I'm scared of being alone. I have health anxiety and im scared something will happen to me.

I *feel* like I was kicked out of my hotel yesterday morning because the worker did not handle my situation. I had an agreement with a manager but this lady decided she would dismiss the agreement. The whole reason I was able to stay there was because of the exception they made for me. Once the lady took away the exceptation, I HAD to leave. I go back up in my car just balling my eyes out to see my tire is flat. I had to call roadside assistance to air it up. I was referred to get my tire plugged. Turns out I need all four tires replaced because of them balding. 

I'm so stressed out to the point that I'm literally sick to my stomach. I dont want to get out of bed. Im so nauseous, I feel like I almost threw up a few times. Im tired from lack of sleep. Im hot. Im just really really tired. I want to go home. My husband is away right now visiting his brother and I stupidly reassure myself when im with him because he is a safe zone for me. Now he's not here and im not handling this well. 

I really want to go home. I cant go home for a few weeks until we have electricity back on for the town. I need someone to talk to so bad. Please"

Anxiety,Did anyone else go from clinical depression in their younger years and now have extreme anxiety instead?,"This is a weird question but I was wondering if anyone was similar to myself. As a kid and teenager I had really awful depression with just a bit of anxiety. I was constantly suicidal. I tried medications and therapy, neither worked. I would sleep all day and miss school because of it. It was really awful. I had heightened anxiety for sure but I would never say it was ruining my life. Come my mid-20s and I have very little depression but crippling anxiety. Im completely MISERABLE from my anxiety but somehow suicide hasn't even crossed my mind. I dont feel sad either. I feel frustrated and apathetic instead. It's so strange looking back on my old personality. It sounds bad but I think I'd take the depression over this anxiety. Anxiety is literally so PHYSICALLY and mentally painful. It keeps me up all night. I think I'm experiencing symptoms of sleep deprivation at this point. At least with depression all I did was sleep. 

I know brain chemistry changes as you age so I was wondering if this was a common transition."
Anxiety,Body pains and soreness from anxiety??,Anyone have random pains that last days in random places?? Guess it’s from my body being so tense all the time? Along with some not so fun stomach aches. Ready to be past all this.
Anxiety,Twitter account,"I made a twitter account in 2013 when I was like 8, and now I’m humiliated because of the things I put on there. I’m afraid someone will find it and humiliate me. I also have an embarrasing Instagram and Facebook. I can try to ignore it’s existance but It haunts me. What can I do to erase it? I made the account 7 years ago and I was 8 so naturally I have a different Email and number. Is anyone embarrased by this?"
Anxiety,Can’t quite sleep but not quite awake,"So tonight I get to bed about 10pm and sort-of doze but it’s not like I’m awake but I’m not asleep either, it’s not like I’m actually going to get to sleep in this state. My mind is just churning through thoughts, almost like I’m forced to watch a movie as my thoughts go by. Feels like A Clockwork Orange forced viewing.

There are definitely some things I’m stressed and anxious about at the moment but the thoughts are nothing in particular, some recent events, some thinking about what I’ll do tomorrow, some thinking about conversations I’ve had or will have, some of it even re-playing or thinking about things in a Netflix show I’ve been watching - really just a random muddled mix of rumination, it’s not like I’m dwelling on any one thought or source of anxiety.

This happens from time to time, when it does it’s quite frustrating as I’m often not conscious enough to do anything about it, sometimes it feels as if I’m observing myself doing it but can’t quite make the move to get up and readjust myself. So tonight it went until  now, I snapped myself out of it, it’s just after 2 am, now I’m sitting on my bed, drinking a tea that’s meant to help promote sleep, I’m going to meditate for a short while and then try again to get to sleep.

(I know... I shouldn’t be on my phone, looking at a screen right before trying to get some much needed sleep)

I imagine there are others here that experience this weird ruminating not quite asleep/not quite awake ruminating sensation?"
Anxiety,Idk what to call this,"My whole life i’ve been born, and raised in NYC. I’ve always hung around various colored people, with different cultures.

Anxiety,Can I take my Prozac (fluoxetine) sprinkled in food?,"I specifically have anxiety with swallowing and have never been good at taking pills. I was recently put on Prozac by my doctor and didn’t think to bring up to her that my anxiety greatly affects my ability to swallow. 

I came across one article that said fluoxetine is alright to put in food, just not the Prozac weekly?... I’m really new to all of this medication as I’ve never been on it before and am feeling a bit frazzled because I NEED to take it but fear I won’t be able to :("
Anxiety,Do you ever feel a lot more immature than other people your age?,"I’ve pretty much dealt with severe anxiety all my life and I’m just starting to notice how like immature I am compared to others my age (I’m 21). There are people my age with full time jobs, with kids, have their own place, etc. and I don’t even have my drivers license and I’ve never even had a job before as I’ve always been so in my head. I mean there’s been times when I applied for jobs but was too afraid to go interview (this was back when I was in high school, though). 

I don’t know I feel as though compared to others my anxiety set me back developmentally."
Anxiety,God fucking damnit I'm getting anxiety over what I wear and buying clothes,In school some people say that i always wear the same 2 or 3 hoodies (cause those are the only ones I have) and also that one of them is baggy. I just hate when people talk about my appearance. It's like it's only acceptable to wear expensive branded clothing in my school. So I decide to go and buy some clothes cause I don't have many clothes that fit me anymore but when I go looking I keep getting anxiety cause I feel greedy going to buy things for myself and also I dont like other people knowing what I'm buying. I know people probably don't give a shit but the feeling never seems to go away. I fucking hate myself.
Anxiety,I don’t want to move,"I feel like in this sub people are a lot more understanding, so I’m posting this here. My parents are older now and are closing on a house in Florida and the idea of moving to Florida makes me sick. It’s too hot there and being from the Northeast, I just love the seasons. And although I am 21, I really do not feel ready to move out and I don’t have money of my own. I feel as though it is easy for people to tell me ‘to just grow up’ but like people don’t really understand how much anxiety can set you back. Like if I could- I would move out but a) I don’t have a job, b) even if I did find roommates, that’s still a big undertaking and c) I just don’t feel mature enough to live on my own. 

Like I really don’t want to move to Florida but at the same time I have to respect my parents wishes but the idea of moving to Florida makes me sick. Thankfully, I still have three more semesters left of college but really all I can unfortunately think about is moving to Florida and how the current house will sell. But then I think that I sound really spoiled, immature and entitled with like a lot of things of I’m thinking. Like I’m 21 throwing a fit about moving meanwhile there are people out there all on their own. I just- I don’t know what to do. 

I tried posting something like this on another sub, but someone commented ‘just grow up’, which I obviously know but having severe ocd and anxiety makes things a lot more complicated. 

I don’t know- I guess I will just need to suck it up but every day I’m nearly crying over the idea of moving: I don’t really talk to my parents about how I feel because at the end of the day this is their life and they are older now. They are seem so happy- I don’t want to drain from their happiness."

Anxiety,I just went over bodyweight for my squats!,"So I've been going to the gym for about 11-12 months now, and i've improved a lot in that time. I wanted to better myself as a person because when I was dating my (now ex) girlfriend and wasn't taking care of myself physically or mentally. Though only a few days ago I managed to squat 90 kgs which is almost 200 pounds! I feel a lot better about myself now that I am no longer a wet noodle. If it makes it any better or worse I'm 16, weigh 75kgs and am approx 6""2 so tell me if I did good or not. Not sure if I'm tooting my own horn but sorry I just really needed to be excited about this somewhere"
Anxiety,"How do I tell my ""parents"" I get bad anxiety when the WiFi goes off at night even when I know I'm not going to use it anymore? They both have anxiety issues too but it makes me feel crazy to feel it over such a ""small"" issue.",
Anxiety,How do you get rid of the dark heavy feeling in your chest?,"I think it started when I was working a lot of overtime and getting totally burned out a couple years ago and it has never gone away since.

I dunno if it's a physical representation of stress that I'm holding, depression, or what. It's like I cant relax, there is always this tight heavy feeling in my chest no matter how much I relax the rest of my body. Like my arteries are clogged or something.

I've tried to introspect and see what the cause is with no luck. I can strip every possible cause away and go down to like the absolute core level of my being, like a clear gel shaped like the outline of my body. In computer terms down to the BIOS level. But even at that level I'm still wearing this gold pendant over my heart that is coated with black sludge.

Also generally have a lack of energy and motivation. Basic bloodwork says I dont have hypothyroidism or diabetes or any vitamin deficiencies. Maybe chronic fatigue or maybe I'm just lazy idk. That's less of a concern right now. First I just want to lighten up this heavy feeling in my chest and be free again."
Anxiety,My anxiety over my friendships is controlling my life,"Interested to hear if anyone here can relate or knows how to deal with this...

So I’ve always placed a really high value on my friendships - possibly even more than my romantic relationships in some ways. When I was younger I was obsessed with the idea of having a “best friend” and I devoured any books or films which had the theme of close-knit friendships at their core (stuff like babysitters club and anything by Jaqueline Wilson). I don’t know where this need came from exactly, but it caused me to develop some very unhealthy, toxic friendships throughout my childhood and teenage years - friendships based in feelings of possessiveness, jealousy, and codependency to extreme levels, and which probably caused a lot more harm than good in the long run. Each of these friendships ended in them “betraying” me in some way (cheating with my boyfriends, letting huge secrets of mine slip, abandoning me when I needed them and so on).

Today, while I’m no longer *quite* so intense, I still care very deeply about my friends. I try to show it however I can - I’m supportive, always available when they need me, I celebrate their successes and I keep their secrets faithfully. I’m immensely proud of them when they do well and while I recognise their faults and don’t put them on pedestals, I love and celebrate them for who they are - as I’d want them to do for me. 

However I know I can also be idealistic and that I expect too much from my friends. I want us to always be open and honest with each other, and for the appreciation and dedication to be mutual. I hold them to very high esteem and their judgement means a lot to me. I recently had a huge success in my life which one of my closest friends hasn’t even acknowledged, and the pain of it is almost physical. I just want my friends to love me and I want to know that they aren’t going to abandon me. 

And when I start picking up on signs that all might not be well - I freak out. 

Though I try not to let it show, I get panicky and anxious. I can’t rest until normality resumes. I have to hold myself back from asking “what’s wrong?? Why aren’t you texting me? Why are you behaving differently? Have I done something to upset you??” This sends me into a spiral of anxiety and self-doubt - I turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like binge eating, drinking or even self harm in extreme cases. I don’t know why I react this way and I don’t know how to stop. 

I’ve lost friendships in the past due to them not being honest with me about my own failings. A couple of years ago, a person I thought was my best friend in the world blew up on me over something tiny - he threw several years’ worth of built up resentments back at me, incidents from the very beginning of our friendship where I’d had no idea that I had hurt him (as he never expressed it at all). He used some of my deepest fears and insecurities against me and it was horrible. Even when I tried to apologise and diffuse the situation, the hateful texts kept on coming until I blocked him. We haven’t spoken since. 

I have always struggled with conflict and feelings of insecurity and anxiety when others seem upset at me - but now I pick up on the slightest signs and my mind goes nuts. 

I’m starting to worry that this anxiety has led me to being a really toxic friend - the sort of person you feel you *can’t* be honest with because they’ll overreact and never let it drop, or they’ll withdraw from you entirely. I saw a graphic the other day about “signs that you are the toxic friend” and I felt like I do all of them - I give the silent treatment when I’m unhappy (because I don’t want to make things worse/I’m terrified of arguing), I’m jealous of my friends’ other friends (“I bet they like them more than they like me”), I’m possessive (I get upset when I don’t know where they are/what they’re doing), I give unsolicited advice (just “trying to help” - isn’t that what friends should do when you present them with a situation/problem?), etc, etc. I try so hard to be a good friend and a non-toxic person but I feel like I just have too much tangled up inside me. 

Take this week for example - my normally chatty “best friend” has been taking her time in replying to my texts. Her manner is suddenly different - she is using lots of emojis and exclamation marks, something which historically has been a sign that she’s annoyed about something and doesn’t really want to talk to me. Where usually she’d be warm, conversational and thoughtful, her tone has changed to be flippant, offhand and overly upbeat. I’m not sending her messages about anything serious or deep, but I still can’t shake the sense that I’ve done something to piss her off and she’s sick of my shit. I feel desperate and panicky, my mind is racing trying to think what I’ve done wrong. I’m trying to think of excuses to text her so I can keep assessing whether she’s being off with me, I’m turning my phone onto airplane mode so that I won’t even see if she replies or not. I don’t know whether to ignore it or address it, as she tends to get very defensive and finds over-emotional displays off putting and annoying. My rational brain is saying - she’s just busy, she’s trying to have a break from her phone, she’s got something else on her mind (“but why wouldn’t she tell me???” my possessive self cries!) It could be anything or nothing. For me though, it’s all I can think about.

Does anyone else struggle with this sort of anxiety and insecurity around friendships? Where do you think it comes from and what have you found helpful to cope? I hate how much other people’s’ moods affect my life - I can’t rest if I feel someone is annoyed with me and it’s controlling my life. It makes me want to not have friends at all - I don’t want to be this needy, obsessive, anxious, jealous person. But I don’t know how to stop."
Anxiety,Quitting caffeine has been a game changer for me,"So for the last year or so my anxiety has taken a turn for the worst. It's gotten extremely severe. 24/7 I was in a fight or flight state and it got so bad that I would have severe panic attacks every night to the point where I was violently shaking and soaking my sheets in sweat (these could last from 30 minutes to hours). I had an obsession with the fear of developing psychosis to the point where it was on my mind 24/7 and caused severe anxiety. I was in a dissociative state constantly. I'm on an anxiety med (Buspar), and while it has helped, it's not a magic pill. It didn't do nearly enough.

Well I thought about doing something I've tried in the past but failed to maintain: cutting caffeine from my diet. I have gone about a month and a half without caffeine. For the first few days it wasn't easy. I felt like my anxiety had almost gotten worse. Soon after though I started getting slightly better. The dissociative state was nearly gone. I felt alive again. The constant fight or flight state had basically become a thing of the past. I didn't have a single panic attack. I'm not going to BS you and say it was a miracle cure. I still was anxious in public and had intrusive thoughts a lot. But it was toned down slightly, and my baseline anxiety was massively reduced. I'm in a state now where I'm trying to reverse the damage that the constant fight or flight state has taken on my mental health.

Well tonight my mom returned from the a fast food joint with a caffeinated soda (one of my favorites too). I no longer saw it as an enjoyable beverage: I saw it as a substance that I was boderline ""allergic"" too (I know that caffeine intolerance isn't the same as an allergy, but that's the anology I use). Well I drank it. It honestly wasn't as good as I remember, I wasn't missing much. Soon after the familiar fight or flight state returned. It wasn't as intense as before, but it wasn't pleasent. My phobia of psychosis has been stronger tonight than normal as well, probably due to the fight or flight state. My neighbor started his motorcycle earlier and I nearly jumped off my couch.

I'm not saying that quitting caffeine is a miracle cure, and your results may not be this good. Hell, maybe my anxiety will return to its previous level anyway. But either way, I feel that I have an intolerance to anxiety or it is interfering with my medicine. If you haven't tried to quit caffeine before, I highly recommend it. Worst case scenario you go a few weeks without your favorite caffeinated beverage (and possibly (but hopefully not) caffeine withdrawels).

PS: Look out for hidden caffeine if you try this. Beverages with caffeine have caffeine content on the back under the nutrition label in the US (if in doubt, Google!). Also, chocolate can have A TON of caffeine. Some dark chocolate bars have as much caffeine as a soda. I'm not sure if there is a difference between how liquid and solid caffeine are metabolized, but I don't want to experiment with it personally."
Anxiety,Dissociation :(,"What is your dissociation like? How does it make you feel?? 
Mine makes me feel light headed, dizzy and faint almost ? It’s hard to explain. But I feel spaced out and slow. But mostly it tricks me into thinking I’m going to faint. Just wondering if anyone else can relate."
Anxiety,I’m scared I have a serious illness and I don’t know what to do?,"I’m an 18M, since 2019 when going back to school I experienced what I now know to be severe brain fog, this was in conjunction with a heavy feeling in the head/ pressure and constant lightheadedness. I was losing my mind as I didn’t  know what was happening to me. I believe this was my first experience of severe anxiety, it was fucking horrendous. I saw a doctor in October 2019, was a GP who did a neurological exam and did a blood test and was 80% sure it was anxiety. The blood test came back fine and he tested my balance, eyesight and blood pressure, all good. I had an eye test a month later with nothing found. The dizziness went away eventually but the brain fog was always there to some extent. 

Recently this has all flared up again, and has coincided with a recent upcoming job interview, I was ok with no dizziness from literally March till late August. Four days before my job interview I noticed the dizziness and my stomach dropped, the feeling was back. It’s now three days after the interview and I still have the same feeling and feel as though something is wrong with me. I’m scared as I don’t know when this will go and I’m still applying for jobs, I don’t know what to do, I’m scared and my brain fog is awful, sought out help but it didn’t cure this. I’ve lost my intelligence and memory and it upsets me. I’m frightened I have a brain tumour or something which can’t be cured. It scares the living shut out of me. 

No amount of mindfulness or exercise of healthy eating works, this is what terrifies me and no doctor will listen to an 18 year old with these problems, tour brushed off till shit gets serious. I need help and don’t know what to do."

Anxiety,How do you deal with Sunday Evening anxiety?,"I am fortunate enough work a job where I get both weekends off. I also have general anxiety disorder and am on medication for the same.

And usually 75% of my weekends are good. I try to get some exercise done, usually cook something fancy for myself and family, sleep a fair bit, watch a movie, read a book upskill myself and basically do anything i feel like doing.

Then the clock hits 5pm on Sunday and I start spiralling. I feel one of the 100 different kinds of anxiety and sometimes multiple kinds in the same evening.


I feel like I am wasting away my life, I am not doing the things i should be doing, i am not performing well at work or sometimes the all consuming, inexplicable feeling that something is very wrong I just don't know what. A fair bit of this is anxiety about work. Sometimes I start the work I planned for Monday on Sunday evenings itself to make myself feel better. It doesn't help.

I don't know how many people feel this way, but if anyone has any advice/tips/articles or basically anything helpful to share about this, I'll be really grateful.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post!"

Anxiety,Surgee of anxiety,I get these waves of anxiety where for 5-6 seconds i have intense anxiety then i take a deep breath and it calms down to normal . Immediately after i get intense anxiety again and the cycle restarts. Usually this can last between 10-30 minutes and happens every 2 weeks.

Anxiety,Anxiety takes over reality.,"I actually hate myself for doing this now again.

In short. I'm afraid of not beeing able to sleep, because i had one sleepless night against my will.
For the last month everything went well.
I was able to accept and deal with my anxiety.
In time, i began to become my own master.

But yesterday.
The anxiety went straight up to eleven.
I have to say, that i did sleep in the end, but i seems to be irrelevant to the anxiety.
I'm trying to convince myself that everything is fine, i mean nothing bad happend. But it feels like, that i'm unable to look past the obstacle.
Those ""what if's"" are killing me. They are so real to me.

I know that it will be better. 
I know that it can be better.

BUT

The anxiety seems to real.
I can't imagine falling asleep, instead i'm imagining myself, turning in my bed unable to sleep.

I'm so fucking afraid."

Anxiety,Almost constant nausea,"I’m not sure if this is even the right community to post this in, but I’m pretty sure that my anxiety causes this. I used to have a very strong stomach with barely any gag reflex, never had a problem going to the dentist or brushing my tongue or bad smells or anything. Now even thinking about something gross makes me gag or even through up. I get nauseous almost every time I brush my teeth. I have such a weak stomach now. I don’t know if it stems from the anxious feeling that I constantly feel in my chest and stomach or if my adhd meds make it worse, but I just don’t know what to do. I can’t even eat food unless I’m craving or want that particular food, because even the thought of it makes me nauseous."

Anxiety,I think I may need daily medication. Any success stories out there?,"I've suffered from GAD, OCD and PTSD since childhood and I've mostly been able to manage without medication up until recently. I've started getting daily panic attacks out of the blue. I'm hyperaware of my heart and often feel like I'm suddenly going to have a heart attack and die. I've become more irritable and just a pain to be around. I'm losing sleep over it and I feel so defeated. I'm supposed to graduate uni in the next year but I'm scared of my anxiety getting in the way of that. 

I have benzos for the panic attacks but I don't want to rely on those too much. I heard some SSRI's are good for anxiety, but I'm scared of the potential side effects... especially the suicidal thoughts (I struggle with those quite a bit). Has anyone had success with daily medication? I'd appreciate reading your experiences, thanks! &lt;3"
Anxiety,How can I learn to cope with the impending death of family members?,"I am adopted, and because of that most of my family is significantly older than the average person my age. By the time I was 18, all my grandparents were gone. Currently, my aunt is dying of cancer. Even though she is no longer responsive, I see her often and try to comfort her and let her know I love her. My dad is 73, ex smoker, and in poor health. My uncle is in his late 50s but has a horrible diet, drinks only Pepsi, and smokes like a chimney. My other aunt is also in her late 50s, and has suffered a stroke. My mom has struggled with diabetes for most of her life. I know that I could lose them at any moment, and it scares me to death. It keeps me up at night and I have a hard time not letting it get the best of me. It's grim to say but by the time I'm 40 I might only have a few close family members left. Watching them slowly wither away is absolute hell. It hurts me deeply and I don't know how to cope."

Anxiety,Small town outings give me massive anxiety,"I recently went out with friends in my hometown. It’s about an hour from where I currently live. Everyone knows each other there. (950 is the population). I got too drunk and said stupid stuff, I also told some people I got a new job, which I love , and that I do accounts payable. I played inappropriate music on the box and was a blubbering mess, I rarely get this drunk or go out much. I now have massive anxiety that I made a fool of myself and it will circle around to my new job, and everyone will know. How do I get over this fear and move in. (I didn’t say anything confidential to my job. Just duties and tasks) HELP I now think the entire town is talking about me. . ."
Anxiety,All eyes on me,"Never thought this would escalate, but here we are.

I've always been kind of a lonesome guy, watching and following things from the sidelines, while doing my own thing minding my own business. I have a family i'm very much happy with, but my problems start the moment i leave my house.

For as long as i can remember i have had this utterly stupid illusion where i feel everybody is looking at me. Following my steps across the yard, judging me, evaluating me. The earliest i can remember is from my early teens, so a couple decades ago, walking across the parking lot thinking the people in my apartment block were watching me.

Now i recognize the problem everywhere, it's gotten worse. Grocerie shopping. Stuck in traffic lights or parked in a lot somewhere. Walking the hallways of my workplace which happens to be a school of hundreds and hundreds of people, of all places.

This feeling of constant focus affects my gait, my breathing, my posture. God forbid i'd trip or drop something. And when someone stops me and talks to me in a crowded area, i'm not very far from locking up.

My ""reality check button"" says it's complete bullshit, if anyone even pays attention to me they'll quickly glance over and look the other way. I'm not a particularly interesting fellow after all.

Is there a name for this phenomenon? And how do i go about helping myself here?"

I haven’t been around that many people (125) at a given time and i’m just really anxious on how it’s all going to play out. I don’t really have the choice to not go (due to family things). But his family is so blazé about all of the Corona stuff not thinking it’s real and I am just super scared that I am going to get it and give it to someone else and their death will be in my hands.

Anxiety,I feel like I’m letting my anxiety control my life.,"Was supposed to visit a friend out of state today, but ended up having an anxiety attack this morning around 3AM and made some excuse about why I couldn’t visit.

Anxiety,How does one deal with anxiety caused thoughts in a healthy way and not let it effect you and your actions towards others?,
Anxiety,I need help,"Hi everyone- I have severe severe anxiety. I’m at the point where I can no longer function everyday. My heart is racing all day. I go to therapy once a week, and I am currently on day 11 of 10mg of Prozac. I feel like I’m actually losing my mind. I want to beat this and over come it so badly. The past couple days I was actually feeling a little bit better, but randomly last night had a panic attack that made me SHAKE uncontrollably and now it’s thrown me back into a loop and a cycle. I have no idea what else to do :("
Anxiety,Waking up with shortness of breath but no panic attack?,"So this August has been a tough one. Like really tough. Like July 27th I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like I cant breathe at all. And completely terrified. I threw up and sat down on the couch.  At that moment my first thought was ""I am about to pass like my dad"" who passed away when I was 6 and he was 36 of cardiac arrest. He was fit but was a smoker and a moderate drinker.  I am 27 and a smoker for 8 years. But he never got medical help for anythinghe was one of those dudes. But since that fateful night, lol, I've been so jacked up. 


I am, with my employers insurance, 5 grand in debt now. Ive been to the ER this past month quite literally 7 times. I have been to urgent care 4 times, and seen my primary care multiple times. Ive been seeing a cardiologist and have had numerous tests done outside of the ER tests. Ive done almost every single heart related test besides an angiogram. I dont even know how many chest xrays and EKGs I've had. Ive had not one doctor tell me my heart is okay but 6 doctors, 4 PAs, an arnp, and a cardiologist. Yet my lovely paranoid schizo mind doesn't trust them.

They have all said its a panic and anxiety disorder. And for some reason it loves to perfectly imitate heart problems. From pressure and a dull ache in my left arm all day to pressure pain all over my chest up my neck and into my upper jaw. The jaw pain has been the most prominent one lately. I have noticed if I move my jaw side to side it pops and cracks and I dont know if that means this panic disorder and anxiety has given me TMJ.

Anyways yeah life has been hell. Ive almost lost my job. Ive missed an insane amount of work compared to never missing work like i do. Everyday I feel like im going to die when I sleep. I barely sleep. I wake up literally every hour for arm pain or feeling like im suffocating. I check my blood pressure numerous times a day which probably doesn't help. I even take my blood pressure thing to me with work. I have an oxiometer for when I feel breathless and of course its like 99 percent.

These last couple days I haven't been doing too bad. I am still not medicated. I ran out of the alprazolam and lorazpam the hospitals gave me. But I have started therapy and my psychiatrist visit is on Tuesday. So that hopefully helps. And it also helps that I have an insanely physically demanding job. It keeps me extremely in shape. And this week was the start of me and my bosses busiest time of year. And ive been terrified this whole time i am going to collapse from a heart attack or something.  But it helped because I not only did all this physically demanding work and didnt collapse but actually felt kinda better after doing it.

Which helps me tell myself its probably not my heart cause doing what I do if I had heart problems I definitely would have died lol. Not felt better.

Anyways sorry to rant but I am not used to this anxiety all day and panic. I didn't realize this is what an anxiety disorder was like. And its really overwhelming. I thought an anxiety disorder would just give you super bad butterflies and nervousness to the point you feel like you might puke. I didnt realize it could be this damn physical. And its all bringing back my schizoaffective symptoms i fought so hard so many years ago to get over.

Anyways I always have 10000s of questions for people dealing with GAD or panic disorder because i still fight myself everyday believing  its an anxiety disorder and not a severe health problem.


Early this morning I woke up feeling like i was suffocating while I was laying down. Like it startled me awake. And I was kind of panicked. But after I sat up and moved the shortness of breath wasnt near as bad and I didnt actually have a panic attack. Which is now scaring me and my chest is hurting now all this morning. Cause I know heart problems make it hard to breath when you are lying down. I dont know. Has anyone ever experienced shortness of breath really bad that wakes you up from sleep but isn't a full blown panic attack? Like just from anxiety and also I have barely slept this month so I am super exhausted idk if that contributed to it.

Like I just want to know if anxiety can cause you to wake up feeling like you are suffocating while lying down but without starting a full blown panic attack. Some people are saying im stuck in a pretty bad health anxiety viscous circle. And my stupid schizoaffective is just feeding it now.

Either way i have a new respect for you all suffering from anxiety and panic disorder. I got a a few panic attacks years ago when my schizoaffective first manifested but nothing like this and this physical all day. I am not saying I didnt feel for you all at all with GAD. My buddy has it really bad. But just like im sure people have no idea whay schizoaffective is like i had NO idea GAD was like this. Feels like my body is constantly failing or tearing itself apart. Sorry for the rant not doing great just wanted to ask the question I asked earlier about feeling short of breath randomly at night without a panic attack that goes away quickly after getting up."
Anxiety,Side effects of anxiety medications on menstrual cycle,"I've been on Buspirone for three weeks and just had a super light period, but it isn't listed as a specific side effect of the med online. Has anyone experienced changes in their menstrual cycle as a side effect of anxiety meds?

Note: I will talk to my doctor if I'm concerned; I'm just interested in the experiences of others"
Anxiety,High schools merging,"Next year my high school has to merge with another school. Im dreading it so much. I literally hate the people there, they’re all douchebags. I made a ton of friends in my high school and it sucks because now I have to join with another 700 some kids next year who all suck as human beings. Ugh dude I just want the schools not to merge. I hope coronavirus in someway prevents this."
Anxiety,Are there any tips for helping with an extreme needle phobia?,"Hey everyone. I [22M] was fine with needles up until the age of 4. I am a trans man and have to get bloodwork a lot, however, it always ends up bad. I am getting the flu shot soon and the last time I was unaware you had to eat before hand and I passed out. The medics told me I have Vasovagal syncope. This means I feel sick, I start having a massive panic attack, and am prone to pass out. The only way to possibly counter this is to take some anxiety pills. I will still get vaccines, shots, and bloodwork regardless as I want to live a long time. 

I have three massive phobias; (I say phobias because they are the three where a panic attack can be triggered) My own blood, Needles, and Throwing up. The last one may sound odd, but it has taken over my body from a young age. I can’t explain it too well, but that’s the first thing to hit my mind when I start panicking. I have a big anxiety disorder that feeds off of those three.


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to at least ease my anxiety? I definitely plan to eat this time and take some anxiety pills if need be."
Anxiety,How to stop biting the skin off of my inner lip,"My anxiety is fairly mild and it manifests in different ways, but the worst one is biting my inner lip. 

I bite the skin off my inner lips all day long, until it bleeds, every day. It’s getting to a point that I’m very concerned. 

I don’t take any medication due to personal reasons. I’ve been off of all drugs for about a year now. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you do it? 

I’ve tried gum but it gets boring and my teeth hurt."

Anxiety,I'm scared to do stuff,"As I've got older, I've noticed I've been scared to do stuff. Or maybe it's the same things that are playing in my head for years. I realise now how ridiculously small those things were, like playing football, because I was stuck in my head all the time. Even though they are small, I still take ages getting to that point of going for it. Too long, that I forget.

I'm unemployed but i feel I've been productive-ish. My levels of output is poor, I'm trying but I feel like battling a lot of ""stuff"". Even deciding to click a button on my computer takes longer than it should.

I'm a wreck, I'm still trying and I'll never ever give up on my dreams and I'll get over this hump, that's lasted for a long time, let's be real. I just wish I didn't have it. I wish I more faith in myself and my ability, but I'm still the same scares boy inside , scares of the big bad world.

I've never been exposed to the world at a young age, I'm not street smart at all. A lot of changes I need to make, I continue to put off."

Anxiety,RRT rapid resolution therapy,"I have struggled with anxiety, panic, ocd and ptsd for a very long time and my psychiatrist suggested I see a specialist who does ""rapid"" emdr therapy known as RRT rapid resolution therapy.

Anxiety,Job Interview tomorrow after 11 months of unemployment!,"I cannot physically talk about this with anybody as I will start to overthink and get more anxious than I already am, but this is such a big step for me! For the past year I've been home bound due to my severe anxiety and depression, talking with my therapist and talking meds to cope with it. For the most part it works, but unfortunately the meds only help with my depression, they do fuck all for my anxiety.

But yknow it? Fuck it, let me be anxious, it's not stopping me from going this time. I've bailed on so many job opportunities this year, and if I bailed on this one I'd have swam so deep in the void I'll probably never surface again.

Bring it on!"
Anxiety,Got into a wreck last night,"I was on my way to my bf house last night. I was super excited because it is a long weekend and we were going to get more time together than normal. Plus we have some really fun things lined up for the weekend. 

I was turning out on to this road into the furthest right hand lane (as you should). Then shortly after myself and another car hit each other. Immediately after impact I heard this God awful noise and knew I wouldn't be able to drive it any further. I pulled over off the road the best I could (5 lane hwy). 

The other car just stopped where they were. I got out to look at the damage and to call mt bf to come get me. The other party jumped out and charged at me screaming and cussing me. I was so in shock at their actions I didn't know how to respond so I just walked away. 

Once the cop arrived he asked for my story &amp; I told him I believe they made a wide turn into my lane rather than the appropriate lane (or at least to the best I could I was very shaken). 

I end up getting a ticket for failure to maintain lane, and straight asked him if this means I was at fault for the accident. He said yes. Which truly confused me because I swear it wasn't my doing.

My car ended up getting towed and my bf took me to his place. I tried not letting it phase me because I had a big gift I was excited to give him. I was pretty okay last night and we enjoyed ourselves.

Today however, I just can't get out of this fog. My anxiety is at a high. He took me to get a rental and the entire time in the car I was scared of wrecking or him getting pulled over. Then once I got the rental I had some things I needed to go do before going back to his house but I couldn't. It took everything in me to make it back. 

Once I got back I laid down for a few hours because I felt myself going into an anxiety attack. I am back up now and still in a fog (but not as bad). Around 6 of my friends have reached out to check on me but thinking about having to reply freaks me out because I just dont have the energy. 

I think I am mainly like this because I can't remember the details of what happened. Like usually I have an outstanding memory and everything about the wreck has left me. All I remember is pulling over nothing prior. Like I can't mentally see it which is irritating because I am a visual person.

I just needed to get this off my mind. I know I said I didn't have the mental strength to message my friends so this might be taboo to write on here, but I just needed to let it out somewhere and this just seems easier right now."
Anxiety,Have you ever stopped taking pictures cause looking at yourself gives you anxiety?,"I've stopped wanting to take pictures even on special occasions. And it's funny how whenever I say I look bad people just get mad instead of saying ""no you actually look good"" Also I HATE when people post pictures of me and my pictures never get enough likes which kinda confirms that I'm not likeable or just v ugly. But the amount of anxiety I get when I see a picture of myself is insane. I cant use my phone for hours just so I dont have to see it again."
Anxiety,What to do about overthinking health issues.,"This year I(24F) was diagnosed with a paralyzed vocal cord. Everything is fine, but they never found a cause for it. However I now live in fear that one day I will wake up without a voice. It absolutely terrifies me. It's to the point where I can't sleep well anymore, and even went to the hospital for what I assumed was a heart attack, but it turned out to be an anxiety panic attack. I just feel like I have no options about my voice, and I dread going to bed now. Is there anything I can do to help with this sort of feeling."

Secondly, my cat that is staying there temporarily, I’m worried he will fall ill or something idk.
Third, my partner is taking a new job and I’m scared about interactions they may have. I just hope they keep choosing me forever. And even if they were here 24/7 I get anxiety about them getting harmed. I guess I need to talk to
my therapist about my underlying separation anxiety.
Recently 2020 has been one bad thing after another. I just don’t want anything to pop up, it’ll be next month where I can have my kitty in this new space. I just want peace, for at least these next few months. Let’s hope so."

Anxiety,Feeling super anxious at my new job.,"Hi everyone. It has been 4 days since I joined my first  job as software developer. It is work from home. There not much happening now, few introductions and some formalities. Everyone that I came in contact is super cool and friendly but I don't know why I feel anxious all the time. I start panicking  hour or half before any meeting in which I just have to sit listen. The other day someone asked me to introduce me and I went blank and was hesitating and my heartbeat increased significantly. I started to avoid questions which was very apparent. I feel a weird sensation in my left arm like an electric current, that goes to my heart. I have a good answer in my mind but I cannot express it. It has been quite some time since the last meeting but I still cannot feel relaxed.
I am starting feel if I can continue this job or not, because at some point of time I have to take some serious responsibility.
-&gt; Is it normal what I am feeling?
Any help or advice is appreciated."

Anxiety,Having anxiety is a full time job you don't get paid for,"Well, maybe that's not how it is for everyone, but I am always in my head. Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye.

Anxiety,"Overwhelming sense of doom, please help","I only installed reddit a couple of weeks ago, and I never wrote a post so I hope I'm going in the right direction here. I'm sorry that this is long, but I never vented before about this, please help. 
I'm 18, female, I think I have been dealing with some anxiety for a couple of years now, I have been to scared to see a therapist but my mental state has been so bad that I think I need to go.
There has not been one day that I can remember that I didn't feel anxious for the past couple of years,  overthinking about everything I say and do, I act really clumsy because of worrying about my movements so much. I don't know how to talk well with people and all of my answers are repetitive and generic, because I am afraid of expressing my thoughts to people. If I know someone for a long time, I especially can't say a phrase or talk about something new because I'm scared of them noticing, if that makes sense. I hate getting compliments or getting noticed by people in any negative or positive way. I've been bad with my parents because I can't express my opinions on anything towards them, because I've started getting closed off ever since I was 12 till the point where I just act very cold and as if I have no personality, so at this point i'm scared of showinh them i have my own opinions. Anyway, it started getting way worse not too long ago, when I was about to break up with my boyfriend of 2 and a half years with whom I spent every single day wtih for those past years, and still do. The thing is, I solely hang out with him and every single friend apart from 2 I have was originally his friend and if we were to break up I would be left completely alone. The reason for almost breaking up was this theme that is brought up every so often, the fact that the first day of the relationship, my ex pinned me to a wall and didn't let me go till I kissed him, and my boyfriend blames me for that for being alone with him for a couple of minutes. With that, I have been sexually assultet by this ex while we were together, and he doesn't believe me because I stayed with him afterwards because I am way too forgiving. With that, he wants to have either a threesome or sex with another girl, because he says that would make us even. ( he was a virgin prior to me and I wasn't, and that's anither reason why he wants that) I'm not into the idea of any of that, I hate it. Because he was insecure, he made me insecure about my body because he likes really petite flat girls and for months he had been telling me about flat chests and porn stars to the point where I can't look at any girls in movies with him, and definitely can't watch porn, I get offended at memes that have anything to do with sex, virgins, and chest sizes, etc etc. But other than this, I am really attached to him and he treats me great, I do love him. I feel really bad about myself though. We were supposed to break up a month ago and i felt this awful feeling as if i were in a room with no doors and windows, just trapped. I felt empty, and as if the world was ending. My lips and fingers  were numbing and turning white. Even though we stayed together, there has not been one day where I haven't felt this feeling. Every day, 24/7, i feel this awful doom feeling, I can't focus on anything, I lost 7kg this month and i can cry so easily it's not normal. I don't know what to do, I can't solve these problems with my boyfriend, literally we can't find any way to do so. I am constantly hoping he doesn't leave me, constantly terrified of saying something that's gonna make him mad (since he gets mad at me a lot ever since then) and I am so scared of being alone because I have started having suicidal thoughts. I have been having those thoughts because this doom feeling is so intense I literally can't see a reason to live if I can't shake it off. Anything I do, see, whatever, I feel this feeling. With all of that, I have introduced him to my friend (f) and he got mad at me for talking with another friend about medicinal stuff for too long and that irritates him because he doesn't wanna hear about it. He proceeded talking to my female friend for hours and hours, not acknowledging my existance. I felt so sad.  I really think he likes her because our personalities are similar but she's very confident, much prettier, petite with a small chest and can talk about anything. However, I did tell that friend about this and she is trying to help me, but I can't feel any better. I know I'm portraying my boyfriend as toxic but really, he is amazing apart from these things I stated. I don't know what to do, I'm trying to branch out to hang out with more people if possible, and I am just waiting for college to start so I have my mind off of this. I am afraid that if i start making friends and take up some activities and such, that I will ruin the relationship because I would be distancing myself from him. I don't know if it's better to be with him all the time, because he can say mean things to me and get mad, and I can't get mad back because it's gonna start a fight, and i'm constantly stressed because I need to seem as if I'm normal and calm all the time, and I need to not react when he tells me i'm annoying, dumb, can't do anything right etc etc. Again, it can be amazing with him but he just saw so many of my flaws that that's the only thing he sees in me rn. I feel dumb for this being the reason why I'm so stressed, since so many bad things happened in my life and this is the thing that makes me feel awful all the time. I feel guilty about this being the reason I feel awful. Is there a way out of this mindset? I wanna stay with him, but I can't act like a normal person, and i feel so embarrassed about anything I do, literally anything. I got kinda drunk and was the only one who was out of this friend group and even though I didn't say anything wrong or do anything stupid, I felt and still feel like such an idiot for doing that, I was probably loud and just laughed at everything and I hate it. I hate that they told me I smell like alcohol abd I hope i never see those people again because I am so embarassed. What do i do? If anyone sees this, thank you, since I don't know if I'm doing this reddit thing right."
Anxiety,Weird one: medicated panic attacks?,"GAD and depression here. I'm on Effexor and a beta blocker for panic attacks but I'm still having them physically but not mentally? So my skin breaks out, my scalp is awful, I'm sweating and pins and needles in hands but no racing heart and no despair. Can your body still react even if your brain is calmer? It's weird. Like a possession :O"
Anxiety,I'm breaking my own heart,"I'll do something I enjoy, or meet someone I like. Once I'm home, I'll think about every little thing I did, examine their behaviour and come up with scenarios in which they dislike me. I'll also come up with nice scenarios, but those make me feel sad because I don't think they will ever happen. 

I'm breaking my own heart by thinking."
Anxiety,What's your favorite audiobook that helped you cope with your anxiety?,"What audiobook helped you the most? I use audible if that makes a difference. 

I've had SEVERE anxiety all my life but only in the last few years have I genuinely tried to combat it and feel better. Meds don't help me that much, I've been on so so many to find only a small reduction in my overall anxiety. 1mg lorazepam will knock my 6'5"" 200lb bf out like a light in the middle of nearly any anxiety attack and it takes a minimum of 2mg to rip me from the middle of an anxious episode, 1mg is ok for small anxieties. It's so frustrating that either my body isn't as receptive to medication or that my anxiety is just that high at all times. My therapist who I've been seeing for a year retired a month and a half ago and unfortunately I am going through a LOT right now, and could really use something to help me. Though life is crazy as can be rn, my anxiety isn't new and hasn't changed. It's the same anxiety (about literally everything all the time) and I've had ENOUGH. Radical acceptance is something I severely struggle with because my anxiety/mental illnesses are what I hate about myself the most aside from my weight, which seems to be something I need to accept bc it just keeps piling on with any meds I get put on. I'm overwhelmingly terrified of other people and their potentially negative thoughts about me. Going to the store was terrifying to me before covid and now it's absolutely unbearable unless I go in the middle of the night. Everything is just so damn scary! Even when I know it's not. Nervous system hyper-sensitization allllll the way lol. 

I like learning about what's physically happening to me when experiencing anxiety, it helps me feel more normal, idk. Oddly enough, I was a psychology major but dropped out as a sophomore after having a nervous breakdown over failing I/O psych and because I was convinced (by others) that I could never be a good psychologist because I was just too crazy (as I was labeled by others, so that was my belief for the longest time). Anyway, I have a deep passion for psychology and neuroscience and like learning about myself and my anxiety through this lens, from a psychologist's standpoint. 

I like podcasts but find more information from actual scientific studies in audiobooks and less anecdotal information like I hear from podcasts. Not to dig on anecdotal evidence, it's important to understand how other people dealing with the same affliction feel and deal with it, cold hard facts just hit my brain differently in a way that really sinks in. I suppose I'm open to podcast suggestions as well. 

Thanks so much :)"
Anxiety,I feel anxious about my friend most days,"I live with three of my friends - one who is constantly either anxious, overwhelmed, depressed, angry...etc. Before we moved in together, she wasn’t this bad but over the last three years, she has gone from crisis to crisis. I’m planning on not living with her when our rental contract ends so I know I have that to look forward to but for now I just feel constantly anxious around her. I feel guilty and anxious worrying about her when I come home such as will she be home, and what kind of mood will she be in. And even when I try to introvert in my room and not be around her i feel guilty that I’m not being a good friend and being there for her, or I feel anxious not knowing what’s happening.

I know I need to have a healthy balance/boundaries, but I’m really struggling. Any tips on managing my own anxiety around the situation?"
Anxiety,How did you overcome your fear of judgment?,"No matter what I do, I always feel like someone is judging me. When I receive compliments for some work I did, I always think people are making fun of me and they don't mean that. If I text someone, I overthink about being a bother or look stupid. When I make new friends and have to introduce myself, I just keep thinking they're going to talk bad about me behind my back. 
Even while I'm typing this, I'm so scared someone will think this is such a dumb thing to ask.
Lately, I won a small writing competition - but I couldn't be happy. I'm sure there's someone who deserves that little prize more than me. What if they are talking bad about me behind my back? 

I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes - I'm not a native English speaker. Plus, I've never written anything on Reddit before. I hope I respected every rule of the community. 
Thank you so much for listening."
Anxiety,"Bad gut feeling thinking of ex, but only at work","I recently got a new temporary job, which has been good for the most part.
The thing is, I do orderpicking in a warehouse, which means I am alone with my thoughts most of the time.

For some reason I am constantly thinking about my ex, and have this bad gut feeling. Before I had a job and when I am not working I'm not worried over my ex whatsoever. I feel very happy with my current girlfriend!


Perhaps an important detail is that my current girlfriend lives across the world, and we haven't physically met in 5 months.


I wish I understood my emotions, ugh."
Anxiety,Almost started working out,"For months on end have been making excuses to not sign up to a gym.

Finally signed up and for the last few weeks I have driven over straight from work late at night, only to sit in my car for 30+ minutes freaking out and end up driving all the way home. 

Last night I ventured over, only to head back home after I couldn’t figure out how to open the after hours access. Left feeling humiliated.

Tonight, I made my way over after work, sat in my car for ages syking myself out. I watched someone else open the door so got out and copied them. Walked inside and within minutes I crumbled, couldn’t start a piece of equipment so ran out.

I could not stop crying all the way home, feeling useless. But I made it inside finally, so it’s only up from here."
Anxiety,Blushing at later age?,"I'm 30 years old and I've not had this problem before, or not as bad. I've always been very shy and anxious person and social situations are the worst, but now seems I've developed blushing too and I hate it!

How common it is to start blushing at later age? I feel like most have it since youth."
Anxiety,I feel so sick,"every moment I have doubt, it gives me a gut wrenching twist in my stomach. I’ve had three anxiety attacks this week. how do I make it go away? how do I stop crying? I just want to feel loved back in my relationship. I just want to feel happiness in myself, but my brain takes over me. I want security but I freak myself out to the point where I almost puke from hyperventilating or I cry endlessly."
Anxiety,I almost became a mass murderer due to undiagnosed Body Dysmorphic Disorder," 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've recently self-diagnosed myself with BDD, and I feel like it answers so many questions that I've always had about myself, and explains so many of my issues.

The title of my post is dramatic, but I thought that there must be someone out there who this may help, as well as that I need to get it off my chest. This is how BDD wrecked havoc on my personal development in life.

Going to try to keep this pretty concise.

I'm in my early thirties, and for the past decade, almost, I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and get my life back on track.

I first started showing signs of BDD when I was around 8. I hated my face so much that I didn't want to leave my room or be seen by anyone. My parents did their best to help me, but I was convinced I was hideous. From then on, BDD related intrusive thoughts were a constant.

As I got older and entered puberty, I was already suffering from social anxiety, and a strong sense of being ""different"". I felt subhuman. I was very conscious of my appearance, and absolutely hated how I looked, but BDD also plagued my subconsciousness; it affected how I acted around and towards other people. I didn't develope the same social skills as people around me, especially with regards to the opposite sex; when a few people started dating in the 6th grade, I actually had a girl I was into, and who was into me, but I completely lacked the sense in my head to do anything about it, and she started ""dating"" another guy.

This pattern of avoidance continued through my teens, as I would see people dating and being social, and I felt like an outcast. What makes it extra painful is that I actually turned girls down, because I wanted to avoid .. being with them. It was a very difficult and confusing time for me. I felt more and more like an outcast, and at this point, my group of friends was also going down.

From the 3rd grade, I never really did homework. I can't explain what the reason was, because I come from a really great and loving family, I went to good schools and had motivated peers, but I never did homework. Again, this feeling of being different from everyone else.. I now believe that my BDD was so bad that I legitimately started thinking I actually WAS different, and that I was a monster.

I started browsing sites like 4chan, and other various slum websites, from the porn variation to the gore variation. I became fascinated by serial killers and mass murderers, like school shooters. I felt it resonated with me... I was a monster, and the idea of unleashing all the pain and confusion that had plagued my mind, onto everyone around me, was appealing. Everyday after school, when I wasn't mindlessly gaming for hours on end, I would view this filth and poison my mind further. I would harass people online, and towards the end of my teens, I was becoming a toxic person in real life too, especially towards my family.

I dreamed of suicide. I dreamed of shooting up my highschool, or doing the same downtown. All the while, I maintained a dwindling social life with a core group of friends, where I would lament my loner status, having no chance with girls, and just.. being different.

I realize my post is now very long, so I'm going to leave it at that. But, hopefully, I have shared some insight into how a mental disorder like BDD can spiral out or control, and if left unchecked, under the proper circumstances; destroy your soul.

One last thing that I want to add, after now being sure that I've properly diagnosed myself; I can't begin to describe the amount of sadness, remorse, and regret I have for having thrown so much of my life away, and the other people it affected. I'm sad that I wasn't diagnosed, and I'm sad that I became how I became. So many people I could have known, girlfriends I could have had, things I could have done and experienced.. and above all, how different my outlook on myself and my life could have been."
Anxiety,Movies TV shows to get through first two week of starting anti depressants,"Hey! I’ve (for the second time) started on ecitalopram after experiencing a second acute episode of anxiety! 

I’m also experiencing quite a few sides effects on top of my anxiety which is very physical - nausea, shaking, no appetite, vomiting, tight chest etc Etc and am feeling quite down! 

To help get me through the next few weeks, I would appreciate any suggestions for funny / light hearted movies or TV shows? Or maybe even some low key activities?

Or what helped you get through it? 

Thanks kindly, Mel"
Anxiety,Can’t sleep,"Hey guys! So normally sleep isn’t a problem for me. Even though I have anxiety and stuff during the day, by the time I go to sleep, my body is so tired that I could get myself to sleep. But today, I had a major panic attack few hours ago and I was able to calm myself to be able to go to sleep. But the thing is that I woke up a hour later. And since then, I can’t go back to sleep because I feel the stress in my brain and i feel jerky when I almost fall down to sleep. Is this normal? What is happening? Is this going to last forever? I need to sleep because I have work and my anxiety gets really bad when I don’t sleep enough. Please help"
Anxiety,2 Different crisis hotlines hung up on me because I was incoherent at my worst moment and because they took personal offense to my situation.,"Not incoherent the entire time, Just when absolutely breaking down and unable to control anything from my body, crying manically, to my brain running a million miles an hour.
  
First one, national suicide hotline, 15 minutes on hold waiting. I spiral and breakdown. trying to hold anything together and explain my situation, 3 minutes into the call I heard the operator say ""Can't understand you dude"" and then they hang up not 10 seconds later. 
  
Second I called my local health network crisis line. This company also who handles my therapy and medications for the past 5 years. When asked to explain my therapy history to the ""crisis specialist"", they took personal offence to me saying ""You guys"" ONE TIME as a reference to the company + it's employees as people who have not helped me. (*news flash* if i'm giving you my history you have not helped me yet.) After interrupting me multiple times as I'm trying to explain the meaning of ""You"" to someone who finally just rants at me for nearly a minute about how 'I've never dealt with them specifically before' and how to 'not make it personal' I hung up before I exploded on their ignorance and woke up my roommates. 
   
The only person willing to treat me like a human being was the one who answered after calling to report the 2nd incident. By this time I am pure vindictive rage and calming down because I'm going to get my revenge for abusing me at my most vulnerable moment. 
  
If I've learned one thing from my experience with Hotlines in the past 5+ years, its don't call them. Call a loved one or friend who regards you as a living, thinking human being. These hotline and their 'specialist' are just there for a paycheck and will make you suffer for their own easement, the same as any other job."
Anxiety,I have become anxious around my girlfriend and I am not sure why,"Hi everyone,

I have been dating my girlfriend for almost two years and it has been absolute bliss. She is kind, caring, compassionate, empathetic, my best friend, and as corny as it sounds I do believe she is my soulmate. I had no issues at all with our relationship, and I still don’t, but for about the past week I have been anxious when around her and I’m not sure why. I have general anxiety disorder so anxiety is nothing new to me, but what is new is when I’m around her I get anxious, or even when I’m thinking about her I get anxious. 

I have been trying to figure out what can be the cause of the anxiety, but I cannot pin point it. I think it may be because I do not want to hurt her in any way, but I’m not sure why I think that because I do not want to break up with her and will not break up with her. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this with their partner before? If so, what did you do to fix the situation and what was the outcome? Thank you for the help."
Anxiety,Job interview today,I'm going to an interview in person today. Lately they have mainly been over the phone. My stomach is already acting up. I feel like I'm gonna not gonna know what to say or I'm gonna sound dumb. I've been going over possible questions and answers in my head but I'm still worried they will throw in something I didn't think of. This would be a great job for me and I really need it too. Any reasurring words or words of advice?
Anxiety,Thought I should share my story...,"Alright, context first... I have been doing an Internship which was mandatory by my college. In the internship, we had to prepare a Case Study, Literature Review, and then give a viva. The first 2 were done, and today was our online viva. We used Microsoft Teams for that. We were given to prepare a Powerpoint Presentation, share our desktop, and present it. In the Presentation Slides, we had to write an overview of the Case Study and the Literature Review that we had written. Preparing the Presentation Slides wasn't a big deal for me, as I've also done that a few times, before. 

Now, my turn came for the viva. I shared my Powerpoint Presentation on the Microsoft Teams. And then the sir, who was taking our viva, said, ""Alright, now present it."" And that's when it happened. I couldn't speak a word. I didn't know what to say. I sat there in silence. I struggled to utter some words, and finally what came out was, ""So, um... uh... this is my presentation..."" And after a few intervals of silence, I repeated the sentence again. Then sir asked me some questions, and thankfully, they were very simple, so I was able to answer them, except the last one, ""So what is your conclusion?""

*What do you mean conclusion? What do I say? You mean the conclusion of the Case Study, or this Presentation? I can't remember the conclusion I wrote in the Case Study. How do I open my Case Study folder, my computer is lagging too much, right now. I don't have time. What do I do? What do I say?*

I repeatedly hit my hands on my thighs, telling myself to speak at least *something*, but nothing came out except, ""Um..."" and ""Uh...."" 

Then at last the sir said, ""Alright, I get it. You have trouble presenting the slide, right?"" 

""Yeah um... Right.""

""Fine then. Now, I will be taking the viva of the next participant, and removing you from the meeting.""

That was one hell of an anxiety rollercoaster for me. God knows if I'll pass the Internship or not. I sometimes ask myself, why am I like this. But then eventually get over it, and move on."
Anxiety,Anxiety makes me react badly to ‘feedback’ - any tips to handle this?,"Every time I get feedback I react badly to it (internally) my heart races, my face goes red, I become panicky and start tearing up. The only way I can handle this is to just ‘shut down’ and wait for it to be over! 

Anyone else have this?"
Anxiety,Anyone else have a fear of death so extreme it's controlling their life?,"Last year in August I had a really bad existential panic attack because it hit me I'd die one day, and it's almost like it's left me permanently depressed. 

Every thought I have is accompanied by ""don't bother doing that you'll just die and won't even remember"". I remember on my birthday shortly after I was on my way to get a piercing and I was so excited and then the thought crept in and my day was ruined and I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach. I wouldn't say the feelings lessened since August but I've definitely gotten use to it, it's like a droning noise in the background of my mind that occasionally flares up in random spikes of utter panic that leave me feeling completely broken. I just can't get over the fact that one day I'll die and it'll be like I never was, I won't even remember typing out this very post and this knowledge makes me feel like I'm Not even real.

I've found that I tend to use this as some sort of messed up coping mechanism, if i start panicing I tell myself nothing is real and neither am I so it doesn't matter, but it hasn't helped in the long run because I've started adapting it to other situations. Say I've upset a person and I feel bad, well I'll also have the thought ""they're basically not real and they'll die one day and forget it so it doesn't matter""

I don't know what to do anymore, it's like it's a massive part of my daily life now, I sleep in late and stay up as late as I can every night so that when I do finally sleep im so tired that I don't have a chance to lay there and wallow in thoughts that end up turning into panic attacks, and that in turn has screwed up my school life because I'm missing at least half of every week because I feel too tired and depressed to even get up

Just to clarify too, being told ""that's what makes life so precious, you should appreciate it while you can!"" Does not help me in any way, in fact it makes me feel worse because I'm being reminded that it will end (""while you can""), everyone I've told seems to use this same line and I've had people get all huffy because I won't accept what they've said in a ""thanks I'm cured"" way."
Anxiety,How do I stop being rude because of my anxiety?,"So I’m 17 and just got my first job in a fast food place. My job is to take orders (in person and both on the phone). I have really bad anxiety so this was out of my comfort zone and also I’m extremely awkward. My boss and my friend there told me that I’m being rude to the customers and to be “more polite” which made me even more nervous than I was. Yesterday I was with my boyfriend and asked him to pretend he’s a customer and tell me if I act rude and he said that I do a little bit and I really don’t know how to fix it or how I should act, help?"
Anxiety,My anxiety feels 'meta' and I have no clue what to do about it,"\*I've never actually posted on Reddit before so apologies if this is formatted wrong or whatever\*

So I'm 19 and am starting University in just over a month and I cannot begin to describe the meltdown I'm currently facing. I've struggled with crippling anxiety for years now and it's held me back in so many areas in life. Things such as being able to hold a job and constantly flaking on friends when I have any plans just to avoid that feeling of needing to throw up and not knowing where I could get away with doing so. I've spent the last year on a 'gap year' AKA locking myself in my room for a year as it's the only place I feel comfortable. I've tried antidepressants like Sertraline which gave me nothing but side effects for a year and also bought into the CBD oil hype in hopes the praise it was getting would hold up for me but again nope my anxiety is apparently on some god mode shit and is not effected by any kind of substance. 

Now, the reason I feel my anxiety is 'meta' (which probably sounds stupid I know) is because I can never explain what I'm anxious about when I'm going into a social situation. Eating in public for example, most people with this anxiety explain it as feeling embarrassed that people are judging them but this is where I differ from most people with anxiety I feel. While I do struggle with eating in public at times it's not because I feel like people are judging me I couldn't care less about that because I understand that eating is normal but my body doesn't agree and decides it's time for me to throw up and shit myself at the same time. Is it possible that I'm anxious about getting anxious? 

At this point it genuinely feels like there's no hope for me like there is for other people as my situation sounds so dumb. There seems to be no root of my issue it's literally just my body trying to kill itself anytime I'm in a situation that is like semi new to me so how can this actually be fixed? 

So I guess I'm just asking am I actually just going to have to live with this until I decide I've had enough and eventually take the easy way out or is there any kind of hope for me?"
Anxiety,DAE Feel really weird when they don’t feel anxious,
Anxiety,Anyone have lots of things that should give you anxiety but don’t ?,"I have plenty to be anxious about ....business owner, wife, baby on the way, covid.......but I get excited about these things (maybe not covid) and crazy bouts of anxiety and smaller panic attacks from what feels like absolutely no reason other than my over active brain .  Anxiety is one tricky bitch ."
Anxiety,Scared of losing my senior year to coronavirus 2021,"I'm a rising senior in college. My school just announced that we are doing the fall semester online. At first they seemed committed for us to return with restrictions and masks etc. But seemingly out of nowhere they decided to scrap the whole plan.

I miss my friends and my team. I didn't even get to say goodbye to them last semester. My best friend was class of 2020 and I never got to say goodbye to him in person or see him graduate. I'm scared that I'll never see any of them again after college. I love my family but we push eachother's buttons sometimes. I worried that if they can't get this stupid virus under control in 6 months what difference will 4 more months do. Online classes send my anxiety through the roof and I can't focus. I want to graduate with my friend group and team I don't want to do it online. I don't know if the spring will be the same but the uncertainty is killing me."
Anxiety,Rough day...,"Hi guys,

It's just been such a rough day. A tomorrow is looking even worse.

I'm so anxious about everything.

Feel so alone."
Anxiety,Let's focus on the good for a minute. What's one thing you're grateful for this today?,"I'll go first. I'm super thankful my fiance changed my wiper blades on my car yesterday because apparently, it's supposed to storm its butt off today."
Anxiety,I am so scared right now,"My husband is getting surgery today and someone was supposed to drive him since he is going to be groggy once he gets out. Well... no one was able to come with him so guess who did have to... yep you guessed it me, his surgery is out in the city which means I’ll be driving on the freeway going super fast and I am not looking forward to it at all. I get super anxious behind the wheel and overthink everything. Any tips on how to calm down or how to get over this at least for today?"
Anxiety,"Feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, literally.","Recently I’ve been feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, but literally. I can’t stop moving and stretching or cracking my bones, all of it. My heart feels like it’s fluttering and my legs feel like they won’t ever stop moving. 
I’m overweight and sometimes I know this has part of the reason to do with it. I just wonder, how much better would I feel if I didn’t have this little gut when I sat down? 
This info isn’t needed but whatever. I was diagnosed with GHSV-1 in February and I’m currently going through my 2nd outbreak, and it fucking sucks. I’m extremely uncomfortable, woke up 5 times last night because of it. (For those who don’t know anything about herpes though, it’s not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, the stigma is the worst part)
It’s just all of it combined has me feeling like I want to die again. Being uncomfortable in your own skin is probably one of the worst feelings I’ve ever experienced, I don’t wish it on anyone."
Anxiety,"I had an anxiety attack at work yesterday, scared to go today","I'm an 18 year old trans male, my entire life I've struggled with social anxiety and depression, I struggle to be around many people and texting is the easiest way for me to get my feelings out.

I work with a disability center for now until i can get an actual job, i garden and other stuff get paid alright but yesterday I flipped out and I think I had an anxiety attack or panic attack I'm not so sure.

They brought out the lawn chipper or something I couldn't see it and the noise made everything blurry and dizzy and I almost passed out my heart was racing so fast and I could barely breathe through the mask I use every day. 

I was digging at my ears and eventually came to but still shocked, I didn't talk for over an hour and I am still shaken over it. I slept until 4 am once I got home at 3 PM. I have a sickening feeling in my stomach as time ticks by and I have to go to work soon, they've never seen me like that before. I usually have  my headphones in but didn't have them that day because they were dead. 

Usually when I'm kinda anxious my hearing seems to make music seem like it's slower and stuff and my stomach aches terribly and that's how I'm feeling right now, I'm shaking slightly and holding my cat but I still feel terrible.

I have extremely good hearing due to my eye sight being so bad and I also have a form of autism called aspurgers or something and Misophonia probably other things too but I don't remember or really know. 

I also have trouble talking to people I don't know or large severs, have terrible self esteem to where my mother thought i had paranoia maybe i do I don't know and I brought this long enough I just need some advice on how to calm down and forget about this. I didn't tell anyone because they'll probably think I'm crazy or lying or something"
Anxiety,What are some of the things that make you less anxious in social situations?,
Anxiety,Starbucks anxiety defeated,"Last time I went to Starbucks back home, I went w my dad and young niece. I had so much anxiety about ordering that I just grabbed a chocolate milk box. It was winter, I weighed 215 lb. Im back home again and going to Starbucks later to try a tall guava passion fruit. I am not anxious or confident, just normal. It is summer and I weigh 175 lb. I learned that SOME of my anxiety is directly proportional to how I'm looking. I still don't look awesome, I have 30 lb to lose, but I feel more comfortable in my own skin. That's so important. Also, exercise helps w esteem"
Anxiety,Tension headaches,Does anybody else experience tension headaches from tense shoulders/neck. I am tense pretty much all the time from my anxiety (most of the time it's at work or things similar) and this has led to very tense muscles in my shoulders and tension headaches when its really bad. This has gotten since the pandemic as I am an essential worker who has worked throughout all of it and my anxiety has also gotten worse recently. Any advice? I've tried heat creams and other similar things and my partner can give me a massage sometimes but it's very painful.

Anxiety,I think I'm going to lose my job because of my anxiety,"I work as an accountant and I've let myself get behind really badly.  My bosses know and we've talked about what I have to do to get caught up but I'm making myself sick with anxiety and I'm not getting caught up.  

My chest constantly aches, I'm nauseous, having headaches and the cherry on top is  suddenly I have acne again.  

I feel like I should quit.  My masters program starts back up in September and I really don't think I can make it.

Anxiety,Am I crazy or is it anxiety?,"Last night about 2 am my boyfriend said he was getting off gaming with the boys to call me and then forty minutes pass and he hasn’t called or answered me. Any normal person would assume he fell asleep but I started overthinking it. After about twenty minutes I assumed he was still gaming and then I was scared he had died. I felt more scared than I ever have. My anxiety started flaring up really bad. I couldn’t breathe, my heart was racing, I felt like throwing up, and I could not stop shaking. After I texted him some and called a few times he finally answered and he had just fallen asleep. I think I’m crazy for that now that I think about it. I think I’m crazy for freaking out and over reacting and calling him so many times. Do I sound crazy or is this just a normal anxiety thing?"
Anxiety,I threw up from my anxiety for the first time last night,"Hi everyone, 

I’m currently sick and got tested for coronavirus yesterday. I’m 17 so I would be totally fine if I’m positive, but the possibility of infecting my family makes me so anxious. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night, had a panic attack, dry heaved, then calmed down. Then another panic attack, more dry heaving, and then I calmed down. Then another one, and I actually threw up. I’ve dry heaved from anxiety before but never threw up.

Anxiety,Experiences with depersonalization,"This is something I never really talked about before but when I was 16, I experienced depersonalization for two days. It was the first time for me. 

I remember being on holiday in my mother's hometown, I was watching myself from above. I walked into a cafe and ordered, but the view as if I was staring from a distance and above myself. When I sat down with my drink, I barely even remembered the interactions. 

I walked back to the hotel and I remembered seeing people bump into me but not feeling it. It was a crowded city so it's not unusual for people to bump into you but usually I try to avoid it. I remember thinking while watching myself 'Weird how I'm so okay with people bumping into me..' 

My mom was with an old friend who was a doctor so when she saw me curled up in bed, she asked what's wrong. I said I felt dizzy and bad and just wanted to sleep. Her friend wondered if I had anaemia (actually later found out I did have bad iron deficiency). 

Had this sensation of watching myself from afar for about two days before it went back to normal. It was horrible. I didn't understand it. 

A couple years later it happened again but just for one night. I was in a market on holiday again with a friend when I felt it. I said I was feeling sick and dizzy so she took me back to the hotel and I lay in bed trying to make it stop. I felt so bad for making her sit there waiting for me to feel better. 

I only found out I had anxiety about two years ago. It made soooooo much sense. I didn't really know anything about it but when the doctor explained, I had so many 'OHHHHH' moments. This depersonalization thing especially. I seriously thought it was a symptom of anaemia. Now I am in meds and it's been pretty awesome. Haven't had that horrible depersonalization for a long time. 

I just wanted to write this out because I never talked about it. I think it's such a crazy phenomenon. Anyone else had such experiences?"
Anxiety,Anxiety with BP spikes and diarrhea,"Please, please help. I have been taking my bp at home but sometimes when I am anxious or if I have to go to the doctors office my bp is ridiculous. At home it's usually in normal range occasionally a tad higher but not bad. But when I go to the docs it can spike to 170/100 which really scares me. Does anyone have experience with this?? I am now obsessed with my blood pressure. It controls my life. It's a very annoying compulsion. I want to avoid meds but of course the doc wants me on them. This issue got worse after I had bp issues after pregnancy and now has resurfaced after quarantine. Can anyone help??? 

Also I have diarrhea every morning which I assume is IBS. I've only had this for a couple months but every time I have to poop or am gassy I feel very anxious. Gawd 😭"
Anxiety,"Meeting my ldr bf for the first time tomorrow, any advice on how I can reduce anxiety","So I'm meeting my ldr bf tomorrow for the very first time, we are both incredibly nervous, I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and I know I will most likely start to shake and possibly have a panic attack which I am not looking forward to at all.

Hoping someone could give me some advice or coping mechanism.

Thank you in advance!"
Anxiety,The worst thing about anxiety is the stomach ache and diarrhoea,I get bad stomach aches and diarrhoea with my anxiety which makes it almost unbearable and it affects my life really severely. I also fear the anxiety itself for this very reason. It’s a horrible cycle that I find myself in every day. If you struggle this I’d like to hear how you cope with it.
Anxiety,How can I stop tremors from anxiety?,I had the flu this past week thinking it was the virus and it got me very upset the past two/three days I’ve been dealing with tremors first when I would wake up after sleep now they happen anytime and it causes me to be super nauseous. How can I stop them I’ve been trying to relax and do breathing exercises and nothing has helped. I’m really nervous that they won’t ever go away and I’ll be nauseous forever now.

Anxiety,Is it safe to take ativan just one time for a panic attack?,I I’ll that help stop if I’m having tremors? I’m willing to try anything but I don’t want tot eke it long term anymore and develop side effects like I did last time. Will just taking it once be okay or should I not take it at all?
Anxiety,I can't get a job because of anxiety,"Anxiety and depression ruined my life. When my depression is bad, it tells me that **TW** &gt;!suicide is the only way. !&lt; I hate having these thoughts but it doesn't change the fact that they make perfect sense to me and I'm scared that that won't happen because I'd be helpless

That means I have to get a job, which I've always been anxious about, my brain goes blank when I think about it but at the same time I feel like I'm overwhelmed with too many thoughts. The way employers treat their employees scares me. I'm not anxious seeing them, I'm anxious because I know what they say would trigger my depression and I wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

From job application to interview to work and to stay there...it seems like an impossible task for me. This somehow reinforces my suicidal thoughts because I can't live without working."
Anxiety,hospital visit,"as i write this i am again on my way to the hospital cause i fear something is wrong with my heart. last times i went i was told i was 100% fine but my panic attacks are getting so severe i genuinely feel like i’m dying when it happens. i don’t know what to do cause a part of me is so convinced i have something wrong for months now and i’ve stayed up till sunrise every night in fear to go to sleep, i always checks my pulse in fear there’s something wrong. i need to know i’m not alone. its so scary"
Anxiety,I HATE when people make me feel invalidated.,"My mom is always so quick to brush my anxiety off and it’s making me f*cking angry anymore. I have been DIAGNOSED by MULTIPLE THERAPISTS and DOCTORS with GAD, panic disorder and PTSD and she STILL tries to act like it’s not real.

My blood pressure is really high and I had to go on medication for it. I told her I couldn’t believe I was on BP meds at only 26 and she said, “I know, you need to get your anxiety under control” and I said well you know it doesn’t really work like that. And she said, “EVERYONE has anxiety” 

**IT IS NOT THE SAME F*CKING THING!!!!!**

She just raises her voice at me and tries to talk over me and to me she’s telling me my anxiety is fake and stupid and if she does it one more time I swear I am going to lose my MIND"
Anxiety,Does anyone have stories about taking anti depressants for general anxiety/ panic attacks/ agoraphobia/ social anxiety?,
Anxiety,DAE have anxiety that stems from a lack of control?,"Yesterday, my  therapist and I discovered that a lot (most actually) of my anxiety stems from not being in control and being in unfamiliar situations.

For example:

\- feeling anxious when my bf takes longer than usual to reply leads to me feeling like something is wrong 

\- feeling anxious when there is a problem at work and I don't know how to deal with it or don't know the answers

\- feeling anxious of the unknown leads me to worry about impossible scenarios 

How do you let go of control? How do you learn to just go with the flow and not hold so tightly to having things in your control?"

Anxiety,Concrete,"I pour concrete as my job currently, I got done with my job today, then started to make a smoothie, I got some smoothie on my fingers so I licked it off my fingers and then realized there was concrete on my hands. Will I be okay?"
Anxiety,"I was proud of myself, but now I don't know if I should be anymore.","I'm 31 with 2 kids, I dropped out of school in the 10th grade and never got my GED due to life getting busy and then that plus my failing mental health. I am diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, Agoraphobia, and OCD. Therapy has been so incredibly helpful and finally after a few years of going I took the first test for the GED. Language Arts. And I passed it! It was long and hard, especially the extended response, and my anxiety had me shaking throughout it all, but I did it! I'm scheduling to take the social studies test next. I was so excited and proud of myself!! I was so happy and proud that I posted to another sub that I did it and that it's never too late to get what you want done! Everyone was really supportive until I got on this afternoon. 

One comment said ""Its an incredibly easy test thats designed to be passed by people with a bare minimum of education (no post secondary).
Setting the bar pretty low as far as accomplishments go, dont you think?""

My heart fell. I never thought about it that way before. Should I really be excited and proud now? I just feel stupid."
Anxiety,I’m losing weight because of anxiety,"Does anybody else have a loss of appetite? I find it very hard to even feel hungry anymore, I have to almost force myself to eat because I know I should and I know I need it."
Anxiety,~ First time in my 18 years of life I've ever opened up. This is who i am.,"

Ok. I don't know how to start this off, but this is going to be very long. Feel free to click off, no hard feelings c:  


I have never ever opened up, talked about my feelings in an honest manner ever. I have decided to do this now as I have no where else to go, no options left. I feel like my life is a torched roller coaster constantly declining towards the flaming eternity of hell. To be quite frank even typing this out right now, I'm terrified, I cannot stop shaking, it truly frightens me as I am always attempting to forget who I am, what I've gone through and all the terrible things I have done.   


Ever since I was a kid, from all the pieces of my fragile memory that is intact I have suffered from severe anxiety. I could not be apart of society. Every time I would be around people or just left alone with my thoughts my eyes would water, had difficulty breathing, etc. I was in a constant state of the inability to relax/calm down. I have suffered a lot of trauma plus 3 head injuries so it is very hard to cover all the little pesky details as my memories have been suppressed. One time I remember my mum just got a new toaster while the rest of the house was being renovated. She placed the toaster on the ground to test it and plugged it in (btw i was maybe around 8 at this time). Once she left the room, I have no idea why or cannot remember why but I placed my delicate little hand into one of the toaster sockets. I then proceeded to pull down the latch, trapping my hand in the toaster while it was on. I believe I wanted myself to feel the pain, that I deserved it. I would constantly hear my brain keep on screaming to me that I was worthless, ugly. A failure. Whilst I screamed in agony through the ear raping sounds of construction echoing throughout the house, any attempt in trying to pull/pry my hand out was a failure. 30 seconds had past until my mum finally came to the rescue. I was rushed to the ER with hands that literally, I will not emphasize here, LITERALLY looked like burnt toast. The smell of burnt skin lingered while my fingers were crusty. Doctors said that a few seconds longer in the toaster and i would of had permanent nerve damage and had to have my fingers amputated.  


The cycle of life continued, time past. I had turned 11 or 12. I am now in Intermediate school, this is where the anxiety and depression got severely worse. I hated myself. No. I despised myself. At this time I noticed what I was feeling, this anxiety, a true burden to carry, was severely affecting my day to day life. And I discovered through observing the other kids that this is not normal, this is not fair nor is it right. I felt like an outsider. Like majority of people in this realm, I just want to be normal. And being normal is what I did, I faked and manipulated my way around people, no one had and ever suspected that I was mentally fucked up and broken. This killed me inside, to everyone else I was this cheerful kid... full of joy.... they thought. In reality I was sad, miserable and struggled to be in any social situation. Every lie, every time I faked happiness, faked being fucking normal just for the sake of social acceptance it all bottled up. I became lost, my emotions all suppressed and lost to the depths of the dark void.  


*This paragraph will be set from the ages 13-17 (my highschool expereience)*

The high school I attended was supposed to be the best of the best in my area, using outdated medieval teaching routines to forcefully subject kids to learn. This school was established around the 1860s during WW2. Fucking ridiculous how barbaric this school was, If you had your socks even an inch below your calve you would receive a 2 or 3 hr detention. This school was a prison both figuratively and physically, also conveniently positioned next to an old prison. High school was very difficult for me, I knew I was smart but I could not focus nor remember anything I learnt, I tried the hardest I could to pay attention but after 20 sec I would zone out and be unaware. Every day I was forced to endure 6/7 hrs of intense anxiety as the school made me extremely nervous. You were ranked accordingly to your knowledge based upon the tests and seated with your peers based on how dumb or smart you were. This made me feel like a complete fucking moron. So I believed I was. I started experimenting with weed at this time, with weed came a crippling nicotine addiction. Eventually leading on to a stimulant addiction, a benzo addiction, opiate addiction, ketamine, etc. I was always high to escape the ongoing reality and the severe emotional pain I felt as a result of the anxiety. I started rebelling more, getting tattoos, running away from home and self harming for a lil while. Broke my hand once while I was out drinking a litre bottle of vodka, punched a street sign as hard as I could. Every time I got drunk I would get a panic attack as all the memories and pain came flooding back. This was where I stopped giving a shit about my well being, I would routinely take deadly doses of drugs trying to get high and hopefully accidentally dying. I have overdosed 5 times, once at school where I past out underneath a desk while having a seizure and losing blood circulation due to a amphetamine overdose. One party I attended I took 300 mgs of codeine and chugged half a Litre of vodka. I ended up passing out and stopping breathing for a bit. Eventually when I was up I threw up everywhere and punching my friend who was helping me in the face, very very sorry. I felt terrible. This was only the beginning of my life as it slowly degraded until I was nothing. My attendance would drastically drop every year eventually having 140 absences In one year. They tried to expel me multiple times as a result of my attendance but at this point I had gotten (unproud) really good at manipulating people, showing and telling them what they want to hear or see. I have tried to get help multiple times but help shouldn't feel so hard to get. And once I did get a therapist I could not fully open up, she didn't know that, she just heard what I wanted to hear. I tried dating. Maybe someone that actually cared about me would change me, I thought. That was not a good idea, I never could hold any relationship for longer than 1 month, I always push people away when they get too close even when I really really don't want to.   


Eventually I lost touch in my emotions and lost the ability to empathize. I was a lost kid bound to live his life broken. To fund my crippling drug habits I started making fake ids and selling them. This made me a lot of money... but not enough. So I started producing fake event tickets and selling them online, bank fraud, theft. The cops did find me once but I knew the loopholes, I was 16 so I only got a warning off the record. Little did they know I scammed the police... provided fake statements showing I only stole $240 when in fact it was over 20 thousand dollars. I gave them a fake sob story and acted like the lost child I was. Upon refunding the $240 that was it. They left me alone. While ongoing investigations are constantly on the way, I always covered my tracks they haven't linked a connection to me yet.    


I am 18 years old now, I barely scraped my way into university studying digital media and design, attempting to make it into the film making industry. I made it 4 days before pulling out of university because I was too damn fucking anxious to even sit in a damn classroom with people and share my art. This is where I know now it will never get better, only worse unless I do something different. But that wasn't the end. I had enough knowledge, skills and experience to start my own production company. So I did just that. Built up a business from the ground up from home in the safety of my gaming setup and a comfy blanket. One by one more and more gigs started lining up, each giving me a couple grand. Just as I had all the clients lined up ready to make my dream become a reality. I got scared, terrified. And I do what I do best. Push people away and hide. I self sabotaged my life, my dreams, my hopes, my aspirations all for what?   


I hope this can inspire other people like myself to share their stories and know they are not alone.  


Have an amazing day everyone!"
Anxiety,I get anxiety about my anxiety,"Not sure what to flair this cause its kinda a few things but anyway

im 15 and im very sure i have anxiety (Sad or Gad), yes its a sel diagnosis but i plan on talking to a doctor about it when i can because it makes me miss out on a lot. However as sure as i am im worried the doctor will tell me i dont actually hve anxiety, im just somehow faking it or exaggerating so even the thought of talking about it causes me to worry amd over think ot to the point i dont what to talk about it. Has anyone else experienced this? And if so how did you deal with it, were you able to talk about it/get medical help?"
Anxiety,Those of you who have overcame derealization how long did it take for it to go away after your attack?,
Anxiety,Anyone want to talk about their anxiety experiences?,"I’m writing a story about two set characters, and no matter what I do, the main character always ends up with the same anxious characteristics that I have; always apologizing, crying every two seconds, and not being able to focus on anything because they’re worried about how people will perceive them, among other things. It’s a big problem for me IRL, but when I re-read what I wrote, my character just comes off as annoying

The thing is, I’m Asian. My community doesn’t believe in mental illness, so I’ve never been diagnosed, and I don’t really think I have Anxiety with a capital A, since so many people have it worse than me

I was wondering if anyone wanted to discuss their experiences with me, as I’d relate to them? I don’t want the character to be annoying, but I don’t want him to display characteristics of anxiety and not have it fully addressed.

TIA!"
Anxiety,Stress and dealing with in laws,"Hi everyone. I honestly don’t have anyone to talk to about this after I’ve already vented to my close girlfriends. I can’t even tell my parents because they would be worried about me, and maybe that’ll add more stress to myself. 

My husband and I are expecting our first baby this Fall. On top of being pregnant and hormonal, we are also planning to move and currently shopping for homes. The issue of this all is that my in-laws are pressuring us to move in the same city because they want to help etc. They keep sending us emails for homes in the area or keep bringing it up whenever we see each other to the point where I am avoiding seeing them. My in laws and I have a great relationship, but I don’t do so well when I feel like I am being smothered and literally can’t breathe. They put pressure on us SO much. I hate that they treat us like we aren’t adults and can’t make our choice in where we want to live and would guilt trip us for it. I don’t think that’s right as parents and soon to be grandparents. 

I’ve talked to my husband already about this, and he talked to them in private. Still... I don’t think it’s gotten into their head because mother in law is still sending me homes for sale in their area. I’m just ignoring it overall. I’ve already cried in front of my husband and he knows how I feel about it. 

Now here’s the hard part. I wish I could just ignore and feel happy about this experience, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s been eating up my thoughts on the daily. It upsets me so much that I know they will probably be “hurt” when and if we mention we found a house elsewhere LITERALLY 45 mins away... not even that far. They have a thing for guilt tripping us, and I don’t handle that very well. Last night, I woke up randomly at 2am and could not fall back asleep because I was running these scenarios in my head. I am an included and put others before myself, so I think this is why it’s so hard for me to just shake it off... 

I told my husband today that it is still bothering me and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I was expecting him to say, but i feel like he didn’t offer support in that moment and just didn’t say anything. He has been busy with work though so that could be why. Still... I just feel so alone as I’m typing this, and don’t know what to do with all this stress an anxiety. I don’t know how to cope. Anybody deal with in laws or a similar situation?"
Anxiety,Is it time for meds?,"My journey of anxiety has been going on for the last 4 years of my life. My first realizations of my mind being wired a little differently was when I was a freshman in highschool. I didn’t really understand anything that was going on in my head, confusing myself with my anxiety to the point where i thought my whole personality had changed or something. I internalized all of this and I only got a therapist because my mom asked me if I was okay and I started balling my eyes out, so she pushed me into it. I didn’t really get that much out of it, partly because I didn’t understand what was going through my head or how to even express it. So after 4 months of that I quit. 

Early on in this journey I got very into voices like Jordan Peterson, and other “self help” kind of people, as well as self help subreddits, books. I was so determined to just feel happy and I thought if I lived a disciplined, active, and social life, then I wouldn’t be worrying all day. (boy did I underestimate the power of this illness) So I did in pick up many good habits in this pursuit, I now work out regularly, skateboarding has become my favorite hobby, I eat healthier, and I attend a healthy amount of social gatherings. In terms of dealing with anxiety directly I have been practicing meditation, breathing exercises, and various mindfulness techniques. Doing all of this gave me 8 months of genuinely feeling okay with myself and in control of my mental health. 

But now I feel like it’s getting really bad again. For the past month, on and off, I have been having crazy episodes, worse than I’ve ever had. I’ve worked so hard, and i felt like It was finally paying off until recently. I can’t fucking focus on anything. I find myself crying in my car because all I want to do is live. I’m done questioning every little thing. I just want to live. 

I just feel like I’ve worked my ass off trying to manage my anxiety and It just feels completely out of my control. Should I look into medication? And I’m considering therapy again but I haven’t felt that it’s for me in the past."
Anxiety,Its really bad...,"Hello guys, I have really bad anxiety and panic attacks. Most of the time i feel like im about to lose councousness and i cry a lot as well i used to have breathing problems but they got replaced with these symptoms. Im also dizzy slightly but only when i move or stand up too quickly and its just for a second. I went to my doctor 2 months ago she said im hypohondriac and i have anxiety she checked me ,nothing was wrong. Im taking natural sedatives but im afraid i need to take real pills that i dont want to... Also guys i just want to know that im not alone with this so can u guys respond if you have the same symptoms or symptoms like these."

Anxiety,How to reduce/deal with anxiety?,"Hi all,   


This is hard for me to admit, so this is why I'm trying my luck here. I have had bad anxiety for the past 5 days. Not the usual anxiety I have, which is in social interactions or thinking about the future kind. I have just felt this horrible rush that I can't calm. I go to bed at night and my heart starts racing, I have this feeling in my stomach that mimics the feeling of being on a roller-coaster.  I try to think calming thoughts and not give in to it, but sometimes it is so overwhelming it feels close to a panic attack. There is no particular reason to feel like this, at least I don't think so - nothing has changed in the past few days. I have never felt like this before.   


Any advice is appreciated and thank you for reading."
Anxiety,Did your anxiety/depression/compulsions get worse before your anti depressants started to work?,"I'm on Sertraline 50mg and it just seems like it's getting worse.

Anxiety,I’ve been losing all my interests off and on for the past couple months. I’ve also been struggling with my anxiety. Are these two related or am I just growing up?,"**TL;DR:** Since quarantine, I’ve been off emotionally and mentally. I’ve felt a little empty since the start, but I was still my old self (loving my hobbies, being able to laugh and smile, talking to friends). My anxiety has been really bad since mid-May and seems to get worse and worse each month. I worry about different things obsessively and am lucky to get a week or even a couple days off of worrying. During these past two months, I’ve also been losing my interests. I’d hate to lose them because I want to enjoy them and I did enjoy them before my anxiety got worse. I lack motivation to do anything. Am I just growing up or is it related to anxiety? Also, how can I keep my interests and feel better?
__________________________________________________________________________________

I’m such a mess. I’ve been struggling with my mental health (mostly anxiety) since quarantine, but it’s gotten progressively worse since mid-May. Before May, looking back, I was doing pretty well. I was feeling a little empty and off but I still functioned like I normally would. It was actually pretty nice. But, since May, I’ve had weeks where I cry every day and just worry about everything. I write about my worried to post or sometimes just to vent. Very rarely do I have a day where I feel joyful or even fine the entire day. I’ve worried about so many things during quarantine I couldn’t even name half of them. It’s definitely had its consequences. My most recent discovery/worry is how I’ve lost/I’m losing my hobbies. I’m not ready to lose them, and I don’t think I’m growing away from them yet, but I don’t know what else to do.

The most noticeable difference in interests is music. I love music, it’s the air that I breathe and the reason I live. I play a couple of instruments but mainly focus on guitar. I have my favorite bands who I absolutely adore. I love keeping up with them on social media, watching all their interviews, and listening to their music. I also like just learning about music in general. But, for the last month and a half, I haven’t enjoyed it as much. It’s on the same rollercoaster as my anxiety. When my anxiety gets worse, my interest in hobbies decreases. It’s obviously not my only hobby but it’s definitely the most noticeable. It’s not that I hate them, it’s just not the same and I don’t feel much of anything when doing the things I used to.

Actually, before May, my interest in hobbies was thriving. That’s how I distracted myself from everything going on in the world. I was playing my guitar for hours (opposed to the dreadful 30 minutes now), listening to music 24/7, talking to friends, reconnecting with old friends, getting back into some old hobbies, and finding some new (smaller) ones. Obviously, things have changed.

I’ve had previous hobbies, obviously, some of which I dedicated years to. It wasn’t an overnight thing then— it was a slow decline until I found something new that sparked my interest. I was able to acknowledge that I was losing interest and I was comfortable with it because I was bored with them and just didn’t care anymore. That’s not the case with my current hobbies. I don’t want to grow out of them yet. They’re a big part of my life— I can’t lose the reason I wake up every morning. I want to enjoy my hobbies. It’s just different, but maybe I’m in denial.

Then there are things that really aren’t even hobbies. I’ve been very easily entertained during quarantine. I’m lucky to get out of my room, so doing a family puzzle sounds like heaven. For the record, I’m not a fan of cleaning/organizing, but I’ve looked forward to days my family organizes our cluttered house. It’s that bad! But now I don’t have any interest in that. I did a puzzle today and I was just bored and felt nothing. I was listening to my favorite radio station too, and just nothing.

It’s not just my hobby. I’ve been struggling to keep up with friends, too. Like, I want to talk to them more but I just never have the energy or don’t feel like it at the time. I've also had a lot of trouble focusing on stuff. Physically, I’ve either been so antsy I twitch or moving so slowly that I shuffle to get places. I’ve been having headaches every day (could be caused by my allergies). Emotionally I’ve felt pretty empty most the time. Some days I’m just crying and the next I feel nothing. Like, today, for example, my cat (who I love and adore even if I don’t feel it right now) has been acting off, too. She’s ditched her routine, which I didn’t think much about but my Mom is freaking out because that’s what happened before her previous two cats passed. She’s still eating but not as much. My Mom ended up breaking down (she’s had a horrible week, so has my Dad, that’s probably rubbing off on me) in front of me and I felt nothing. I just stared. Normally I’d be crying with her even if I’m not sad, that’s what I do around anyone that’s crying, kind of like laughter. But today? Nothing. Obviously, I’m terrified of anything happening to her in my mind but I don’t feel that way, y’know?

It’s not like I've felt like this 24/7 since May but it’s been 95% of the time. I start to feel better for a couple days (little worry, smiley, talking to friends, into my hobbies), but then I start to worry about something new and it’ll start to fall quickly. Then I’ll be in that hole for about a week or so and then I’ll start to feel better and then get pushed back again. It also changes throughout the day. Today, for example, I felt super empty and then, for about an hour or two I tried to distract myself from everything going on and I started to feel a bit more clear. A little interest came back and I was going to text a friend. But, then, I opened social media and saw something that’s been bothering me and now I’m back here. 

So, anyway, is what I’m feeling normal? Am I just growing up? Should I be worried? How can I regain interest in my hobbies (and just life in general)?"
Anxiety,Did your Anxiety/Depression/Compulsions get worse when just starting anti-depressants?,"I'm on Sertraline 50mg and it just seems like it's getting worse. I've started to overthink more, started to get in a low mood and just now one of my compulsions (rituals) seems like it's gotten worse. CBT starts in a couple weeks."
Anxiety,My sister told me that she needs help and I don’t know what to do,"My sister has always been a little shy. She would hate when she is in front of the line and worry she might do something that delays everyone behind her. Sometimes she asks me to hold her shaky hands before she does something new. I thought that got better since she went to college. She joined a club and started doing events and stuff with strangers and that made me so happy. Today she told me that her anxiety is getting worse. She said she would think about some things and would feel her heart racing. She also told me that if she didn’t believe in the after life she would have killed herself and that she wishes that she was never born. I think the pandemic is a major factor here. A few years ago she suddenly had a phase when she thinks everything is dirty and she would clean everything while she cries. That lasted for a while and i think it’s coming again but not as bad as before. 
I really want to help her i just don’t know how. In my country psychological doctors have a bad rep of overcharging and prescribing a lot of strong medications. 
Please guide me to how I could help her 🙏🏻"
Anxiety,Do you ever feel like you fail at 'basic' tasks?,"I felt proud of myself today for travelling 15 miles on public transport, going to a town I'm not familiar with and getting tattooed. I then left the studio went to the tran station to get home and started panicking, telling myself I was going to lose control and everyone was looking at me and I couldn't possibly get home. I ended up paying for a taxi. I feel like I failed and anxiety won. 

It's such a basic thing that my anxiety just gets in the way of. It's so frustrating. Does anyone else experience this?"
Anxiety,What are we supposed to think about instead of worrying? How can we keep our minds busy?,
Anxiety,Head pressure,"So today I woke up with bad head pressure.  I suffer from migraines and although it did feel somewhat like a headache, it mostly felt like a squeezing of the head.  Not necessarily sharp or painful but my brain feels like it is inflamed.  If I move too fast, I get dizzy.

I have a brain mri scheduled for next week, but he thinks it could be anxiety/stress related due to getting super sick back in January (which we think could have been Covid).


Anyone else deal with this type of pressure in the head? Any remedies?

Anxiety,Buspirone...HELP,"So tomorrow will complete my 2nd week on this medication, and really need someone to tell me this gets better. I feel worse than I did when I first went to see my GP. I went in for one thing and have now developed a million others....I get dizzy, lightheaded, this week I’ve been SUPER emotional (and I’m not very emotional) and the past couple days I’ve actually gone home to nap during lunch because I get so tired I can’t keep my eyes open. I’ve also found that I don’t get very hungry, but I eat to eat. ANYONE ELSE?!! And how long did it take for it to get better?? My dr doesn’t want me to stop and switch now so I’m trying to tough it out :/"
Anxiety,The feeling of being so anxious it's like being on drugs,"I wonder if anyone else can identify with this experience. Sometimes when I get so worked up and anxious over (nothing) my mind and heart start to race and I get this weird feeling similar to being on drugs (even though I'm completely sober)

Even now, I managed to get myself so worked up that I'm experiencing a weird disconnected feeling from my body, totally calm and numb all over my body and my mind feels on one hand full of thoughts and all screwed and twisted up but also like a sinking calm fading feeling in my mind. So strange...

I guess I should just feel lucky as it feels like a really muted mdma buzz, all for free! /s"
Anxiety,One of those days,"So today has been one of those days. I feel so tired, my shoulders are killing me, my shoulder blades hurt so much they make my arms and hands tingle. I keep worrying about things that i know are out of my control. It feels like too much. Today i have a therapy appointment after work, so i hope it helps and that i get a good match. Its so hard to find a therapist that works out of the 8-5 timeframe and that works on weekends. I keep breathing in deep, smelling my lavender oils. I walked to the store during lunch to get something to eat, i got back and didnt even eat half the salad, my appetite went away. I try to keep busy and keep moving so i wont feel or think. I just want to sleep, i feel off balance, i keep swaying. Ive been prescribed Buspirone for my anxiety, and im not sure, take it and then i feel odd, like electricity jolts through my body. I tried explaining to my Dr but she looked at me confused and said she had never heard of it. Im going to keep taking it because im telling myself my body needs to get used to it, but that feeling of the jolt or whatever, its just weird, its uncomfortable when it happens, but it doesnt last long, just a couple of seconds...just enough for me to start the thinking circles. Sometimes i wish there were actually something wrong with me so that i could have an excuse to feel the way i feel. I feel as there are obviously people with real health problems and such, but that doesnt take away the way i feel and its real to me. Blegh. I just want to go home and sleep. My body aches and i just feel so exhausted."
Anxiety,"How can I better deal with ""what ifs,"" anxiety and stop caring about what others think?","Lately my mind has been clouded with ""what ifs"" and the anxiety of being found out about something, even if there isn't anything. I think I put a lot emphasis on what people think about me and it's bothering me a lot. I'm scared that something I say or do will be taken out of context and I nitpick every little thing that I do. I'm a very ambitious person and there's a lot I want to do in life, not only for myself, but for others as well, but this fear is making it hard for me to take any action.

Anyone that has any experience dealing with this, what advice could you give me, and potentially others dealing with this?"
Anxiety,Something really strange happened last night,"I love how just as you’re feeling like your anxiety is getting under control, it manifests itself in another way with which you are completely unfamiliar. That being said, last night was SUPER strange for me.

I was sitting on the couch last night feeling pretty tired because I haven’t slept well over the past few days. I decided to take a melatonin last night to help me sleep, which I do from time to time. I also popped a couple of ibuprofen to help with a headache, again not uncommon. After about a half an hour, the melatonin started kicking in so I told my wife that I was going to lie down in the bed. 

After I laid there for a few minutes, I started drifting off to sleep. I think I was out for about 10 or 15 minutes when I suddenly jolted awake with a full blown panic attack. I’ve had panic attacks pretty frequently since May and I’ve had a few when trying to get to sleep, so this isn’t unusual. The weird part is that I remember things that I did or said while I was having the panic attack last night that my wife swears that I didn’t do. There were a few moments where I swear that I jumped up and sat on the edge of my bed telling my wife that there was something wrong because my heart was racing. I also remember laying in bed and talking to her about how fast my heart was beating and how it freaked me out. I talked to her about it this morning and she said that none of those things happened and that I was fast asleep when she got in bed. She did say that my cats knocked some things over in our living room last night, which I remember happening, but everything else that I remember didn’t happen.

My guess is that the things that I thought happened were just vivid dreams that I had because of the melatonin I took. Since melatonin typically knocks me out, I was slipping in and out of sleep at the same time that I was having a panic attack. My anxiety has been pretty high today because of what happened last night.

Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

P.S. I’ve been posting on here fairly frequently, so I just want to say Thank You to everyone in this subreddit. Everyone that I have talked to on here has been so understanding and comforting. I know that I’ve posted some of my anxiety symptoms that are very common with a lot of people, but no one has belittled my experiences or had been condescending to me in comments or private messages. Seriously, thank you all for everything. You really help me with getting through this rough time. 😊"
Anxiety,Anxiety making it difficult to talk to my doctors.,"I have a follow-up with one of my doctors tomorrow about an injury. I’ve been having a difficult time putting into words just how much I’m affected by this injury and most of my statements so far have been rather general or vague, which has been fine up until I had to apply for Long Term Disability (which has wreaked my anxiety). 

I feel that since I’ve been unable to fully communicate the extent of my issues to my doctor that it’s caused me to lose out on Long Term Disability from work and possibly missed out on important treatment options. Maybe I’ve been too scared to really know the truth? Although my doctor kept saying it wasn’t a bad injury... yet it’s been 6 months and should have healed by now (que even more anxiety). 

So, this morning I typed up everything I could think of regarding my injury and what I’ve been experiencing, especially recently. Having the time to actually think and to type everything out in an organized way felt great, but it also horrified me to actually be able to now see how badly my injury effects me and my daily life, I think a part of me shut my brain off from really thinking about it. I’m anxious and hoping the doctors office doesn’t get mad at me for doing this, I’ve never made up notes to give a doctor before and am not sure if this is normal, but I intend to give a copy to my doctor so he can get a better picture of the ongoing issues with my injury and this way I hopefully won’t have to ask and answer too many questions while at my appointment, which always triggers my anxiety even more. I’m hoping it’ll help with my appeal for Long Term Disability but i’m not getting my hopes up, I just need this stuff to be properly documented. 
I already having irrational anxiety over going to see the doctor, that talking about, or answering questions about, anything on the spot just makes me freeze up and my mind goes blank."
Anxiety,"Challenging myself to be productive and not idle around— for next 3 days, starting now!","Well, It's a already new day, so I'd want to start from right now. Erm, I know It's weird making a post about it but, If I make a post, I'd feel like I have to do it and not just simply give up. 

I've been idling around for a while and It's making me so f frustrated and actually anxious as I think about how I've been wasting time whereas I could've used it to do things and get over it! I really want to be productive but it takes a lot of courage and especially energy— to do something despite having anxiety about every move/action I make.

So, I thought, I should challenge myself by making a post, so I would do it. I really have so many things to do, Hence, I wonder if I'll actually be able to do it in few days timeline and not drag it on for months again.

My main aim is to not spend more than an hour on playing games, reading novels, etc- everything that I use for Avoidance/distractions[That'll definitely be hard to do cause temptations]{I def need to discipline myself}. Also, To focus on studying for entrance exams and just complete some errands I've been dragging on, for few weeks. Also, working out.[I keep doing it for a day or two, and then the consistency is no more. Just doing something productive and not idling around."
Anxiety,"Hi fam, I'm trying to vanish from the life of everybody I know! (:","I don't think I have ever posted here my own post. So here goes nothing.

I'm a very anxious kid. If my brain can successfully handle 500ml of stress this is all occupied by my job. And let me tell you I deal with job stress exceptionally well. I am good at my job and I try to do the best I can even if my boss is problematic.

Any extra stress in my life... I just can't deal with it. I have a somewhat problematic relationship. Sometimes it gets me very disappointed and I feel like they can do better without me. I have good relationship with my family and friends. I am a good kid. A bit of an introvert sure but... This kid is alright.

Unfortunately I have reached a point in my life where I feel like a burden on the life of the many people I am in contact with. If it's friends I burden them with my relationship problem, if it's my relationship I have these expectations and feelings which are not being met. I have strong feelings of love though I may not communicate them correctly. I have given them an out many times recently. Simple, if I am not good enough for you just let me go. These opportunities have never been taken. 

Last month I went through a period where I just wanted to die? But let's face it fam I am not good with all that how and when. Mostly I just wanted to vanish. Breathe and set people around me free. 

So I just bought myself a one way ticket to the UK for Sept. Not sure how it will work out. I figured I have enough time to sort out many things. Not planning on telling anybody. I am not planning any goodbyes. 

Any tips, or help is greatly appreciated - that is, if you have made it this far in the post. Thank you."
Anxiety,Anxiety causing tingling?,"So a while ago my foot tingled and my sister mentioned diabetes. So like the smart person I am I googled and found that that tingling usually happens with years of untreated diabetes and when I went to my doctor she wasn’t concerned. Me being me I am paranoid I have it and now both my feet tingle, this only happens when im anxious and think about it and it’s literally all I think of now. It’s always in the back of my head and when I’m not thinking about it and feel normal it comes back.
Does anyone else experience tingling from anxiety and if so how do you handle it."
Anxiety,Just wanna rant here I guess...,"I try so hard to do well on the English portion of my standardized exam. I work so hard..... I study so hard for it. but no matter how hard I try, I still can’t be better.... why am I so stupid. Everyone else who started at the same level as me has now improved drastically. But then there’s me. Still here. Getting so many questions wrong per passage... sometimes I wonder if the Higher Power has given up on me."
Anxiety,Don't know how to title this,"This is pretty strange but I found I'm incredibly afraid of being wrongfully institutionalized.  To be clear, there's no real reason for that to happen, nothing close.   But this scene keeps playing out in my head.  I like to laugh a lot, often at ordinary things. I keep imagining one day I'll start laughing at something random in public, people will think I'm crazy, which will just make me laugh harder since I'm perfectly sane.  Anyway, the situation keeps escalating, and I just laugh even more at the absurdity of the situation.  Eventually, I get sent to an institution of some sort, and I try to convince the people their that I'm perfectly sane, but no one believes me because they think I'm just trying to trick them.  Then over time, the place wears me down, so I actually do lose my sanity.

So yeah, the weirdest thing is sometimes I'll be laughing hard, and this thought pops into my head and I just laugh even harder.   Idk, I know this is pretty weird, has anyone had similar thoughts/fears?"
Anxiety,"Found a lil escape, it’s my heaven for now","Been having bad GAD for about two weeks now, been on edge all day with the “feeling”. 

Worked out a bit to calm myself down, got into a semi decent headspace, drank some beers and holy fuck it melted away! I feel normal it’s amazing! 

I know tomorrow is prob gonna be hell, but I don’t care. It’s so relaxing to have a few hours to just feel “calm”"
Anxiety,It feel like an elephant is sitting on my chest. I need to sleep but I can’t.,"Have to be somewhere tomorrow, so I definitely need to sleep. If I don’t I’m way more fatigued and it will affect my strength to drive the distance. Don’t know what my anxiety attack is about but I can sleep or breathe it feels like."
Anxiety,Does anyone else have a similar experience?,"Since I was young I would occasionally get this weird feeling between my fingers and toes which would make me have the need to stretch, rub, and constantly move them.

2 weeks ago I started to take escitalopram which made my anxiety spike and gave my panic attacks. Along with that I started to have those same feelings again but this time it will last all day or for most of the day. 

I'm assuming this feeling is connected with the anxiety but I've never found anyone that had a similar experience. Which was starting to make me overthink and think that something is wrong with me... Is it just me?"
Anxiety,What can you do when you're feeling completely blank?,"Ever since I quit kpop last November (due to bs going on in the industry that I can't mention here), my mood has only continued to go downhill. I virtually never listen to music anymore, because there's just nothing as light-hearted and happy as kpop. Beyond that, I seem to just be losing interest in everything. I was in the middle of a Skyrim playthrough not too long ago, but I haven't played it, or any other game, in probably at least a month now. Over the past few days, I've literally just been spending my entire day checking news sites and refreshing reddit ()to see if I've gotten any replies) over and over again.

I really don't know what to do. Nothing else really gives me joy, so I don't see what I could go to that could cheer me up. Gaming wasn't doing it for me (Skyrim is actually a pretty dark game when you think about it). I've also been mindlessly playing sudoku games every day, even though I'm honestly getting sick of doing them at this point, but I just don't know what else to do.

I have failed to find a replacement for kpop for me. It just seems like kpop is the only thing in the entire world right now that's trying to make people happy. I did try to look up some 'meditation' music (technially I just searched for anxiety music), but I found that absolutely boring. For some reason, calm music has always bored me, even long before I started having anxiety problems.

What can I do here? I don't want to get back into kpop, because of how abusive the industry is, but at this point its becoming increasingly clear I was reliant on it, either that or after leaving it I have absolutely no positive media in my life. What can I do?

And yes, I think I suffer from anxiety rather than depression. Over the past few days I've been suddenly feeling anxious for no reason at all, which has only started happening over the past few days. I'm getting tired of only being bored, emotionless, or anxious for no reason all day long. I've never been like this, so I have no idea what I can do to pull myself out of it. In the past I probably would've just gone and watched some kpop, since it made me happy, but I don't want anything to do with that evil industry anymore, even though I still have kpop songs play in my head at least once a day despite not actually hearing a kpop song for 6 months now."
Anxiety,Hi my name is Brian and I'm anxious,"TLDR:I have never expirienced such constant physical effects from anxiety. When the physical effects of anxiety were becoming more prevalent to you how did you accept it and begin to work on it? 


I'm in the military. I've always had what I would characterize as general anxieties. While never debilitating; social anxieties, aversion to public speaking, and worries about general life happenings  have always walked with me like a shadow. I've been aware of these and have worked on them, and have lived a relatively uninhibited life regarding stress/anxiety. For reasons I can't seem to definitively explain I've begun experiencing significantly more physcial anxiety on the tail end of my deployment. Manifesting itself as lightheadedness, shakiness, rapid and shallow breathing, hot flashes, and even a full blown panic attack at one point (yikes). While I believe it's due to mold poisoning(VA disability holla at me) the effects are incredibly real and it pisses me off so much that I feel like I do while doing things I'd normally have 0 issue with. That being said I'm recieving help, and am eager to do something positive about it and manage this. Thanks for reading, and any thoughts or well wishes.  

P.S Those of you who live with these feelings are so damn strong to be able to get up and face every day even though it is filled with anxiety and fear. I'm proud of all of you for continuing in the face of this omnipresent adversity. You're doing great."
Anxiety,What’s helped me come over my crippling anxiety.,"Anxiety more often than not does 100% nothing or 99.99% no service to you, I feel like a large part of my problem and perhaps yours is believing that I needed the anxiety to learn from past mistakes and to learn as a forms of not screwing up again and punishment for my naive actions, but this leads me way more out harm than good with me being paraylyzed and often times procrastinating from how much anxiety I’m in, for making such a large mistake and often times makes it harder for what I have to do because I don’t want to screw up again. My advice may not work for everyone but what’s helped me is just realizing anxiety does absolutely nothing for you, even when you screw up and need to learn your lesson, have some of it but don’t beat yourself forever. you procrastinated all day today, feel no anxiety it will just make your harder to sleep, and waste time thinking about how much you wasted time. And anxiety is what causes procrastination in the first place. I wish you well friends! Realizing this has dramatically helped me and I hope it helps. Anxiety is a lose lose situation, because anxiety wastes time which makes your anxiety worst and the cycle repeats."
Anxiety,Anxiety or something else ?,"22F 5’2 155 lbs 
Hi, for the past year I have had various symptoms come and go after what my doctor says was a panic attack. Prior to the panic attack I had no symptoms of anxiety or any health issues other than Vitamin D deficiency. There is a long long list of symptoms that I have experienced since that panic attack but currently I am suffering with these:

Ringing in ears 
Head pressure 
Nose pressure 
Hot flashes 
Headaches 
Nausea 
Light sensitivity 
What I can only describe as dissociation 
Dizziness 
fatigue 

I had tried Zoloft, Buspirone and hydroxyzine and none seem to help. Is there anything I should ask the doctor to check for ? They dismiss all my symptoms as anxiety but It’s been over a year  now and there are days the symptoms are so bad I can barely get out of bed. I appreciate any help thank you"
Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like no one takes anxiety seriously?,"I'm really struggling at the moment with work being a major trigger for me. I've been telling my supervisor and even went to HR saying I can't cope and asked for help but I'm just being ignored and nothing seems to get done.

When I mention my anxiety to my friends and family, they don't seem to understand so I feel like I can't talk about how ad it actually is.

I'm at a point where I'm getting ideations about harming myself, partly to make the anxiety go away and a small part to show people how badly I'm suffering.

Anyone else feel like this?"

I always hope I don’t regret dumping them as they say they love me and miss me but treat me like a second class citizen as my family is all women except for me and they on some weird girls rule boys drool trip.

Anxiety,School’s coming back...,"Hey all. I’m going to be a sophomore at highschool this year. Im a very quiet and shy dude, and I really only have a handful of people to hangout with during school. Quarantine was a blessing for me because of how stressed and how much my anxiety spiked when I went to school. I feel that everyone thinks I’m weird and don’t want to talk or engage with me. I find it extremely hard to start a conversation with someone. Honestly, I feel like I’ve been dealing with some underlying mental issues that have cussed me to be very asocial. I go to sleep every night stressed about how this is one less day of summer, and how I’m going to have to go to school again. I have a low self esteem as well and I’m more sensitive to people’s words. I am incredibly stressed and worried about how best year will go. I really want to feel better, so does anyone have anything to help with my anxiety? As in how to feel like I fit in or how to gain self esteem? I’ve had pretty bad anxiety for a couple years but high school was were it peaked so far. Please, if anyone has a suggestion, tell me."

Anxiety,Just found out I have COVID,"I live in a state where COVID is running rampant. I have been sheltering in place for months, essentially since this all started in the U.S. I just started a new job 2 weeks ago and found out last week I was exposed in the work place by a coworker. 

I’ve been wearing masks, staying home, not partying or doing anything dumb. I tried so hard. And I still fucking got it. My boyfriend is out of state right now and I’m in complete panic. I know I need to take care of my body but I can’t even close my eyes for 2 seconds because my anxiety is so high. 

Words of comfort and wisdom would be much appreciated."
Anxiety,Family Party,"I was forced to go to a family party. You see, I don't know anything about my relatives, and striking conversations makes me sick and anxious. I was there for only 4 hours, but I was still to anxious. I'm very quiet, and overall just a mute person. It took me 30 minutes just to ask for water, because I was afraid that I would disturb my cousin who was playing a bean bag game. Thankfully, I did have a friend call me (I just keep myself muted and type whilst she talks || and I'm used to talking with her), she did help me calm down, but sadly she had to go a bit later. 
I tried picking up a lid to some food, but ended up dropping, while one of relatives said loudly, 'good job!'. So, I just stood there for a moment, because I thought I made a scene. I left soon after, happy I got home so I don't have speak.
Sorry to vent, I just don't know where else to."
Anxiety,Dosage for propranolol,My doc said just to take it whenever I feel anxious about an event or something coming up and prescribed me 10mg propranolol. Do I take 10mg in the morning and will it last the whole day? I’m 18 (idk if that affects the dosage)

Anxiety,Eating when anxiety makes you lose appetite,"I (30M) suffer from GAD and I'm having a bad anxiety attack that started Sunday night. Point is I can't eat and even drinking water is hard.

I only ate a snack since anxiety kicked in. I have a dinner tonight and I don't want to go and eat nothing, everyone will focus on me and I don't want it.

I'm already on my meds but it doesn't seem they're working. 

What can I do?"
Anxiety,I feel so guilty about this,"Yesterday I was masturbating. I don’t like watching porn as it’s too hardcore for me, so if I do watch it, I look for more ethical sites. I decided to google a celebrity I find attractive and use a picture and my imagination. I googled her name “****** sexy hot” and it came up with pictures, as I was scrolling down, it came up with a picture of her and her children. I immediately clicked back and looked at something else but I feel guilty for that even happening."
Anxiety,Morning Routines,"For those of you that work what is your morning routine like? I have a ton of anxiety in the mornings and am having a hard time functioning trying to get ready. 

I usually get up with stomach cramps and nausea and choke down a larabar while I’m dry heaving so I can take my meds and then I shower, meds start working and things are a bit easier but still having nausea. Then, I do clothes and hair, eat cereal (the hardest part because of nausea) and last I check the house (doors locked and things unplugged). This routine is not working very well and I was looking for suggestions."
Anxiety,"Instead of being excited to go on vacation, I’m apprehensive. Always.","Saturday I’ll be heading a measly hour away from home to go to a beach house for the week. 

Instead of looking forward to it, I’m dreading it. I want to go! I’m just nervous. I’m afraid I will (or already have) contract covid and will be sick during my vacation. I’m a hypochondriac and have severe health anxiety. (I’m one of those people who gets sick on or around Christmas a lot so the pessimist in me says, “My luck, I will be.”)

Does anyone else feel this way when there’s a certain event or vacation approaching? I want to be able to enjoy myself but since my home is my “haven” of sorts, its hard for me.

Anxiety,How can I ease my anxiety regarding losing a beloved animal?,"Hey everyone. I hope your day is going fantastic so far.

So I'm sixteen years old, and I'm dealing with severe anxiety. It's absolutely unbearable. I often stay up late because of anxious and intrusive thoughts (usually regarding ""symptoms"" of awful diseases I think I find in myself), and my brain is constantly busy with those thoughts throughout my entire day. I feel like I have nowhere to escape from these thoughts, and it's terrifying.

Ever since I got my horse Chamomile, I've been dealing with more and more of these intrusive and anxious thoughts regarding the day I will eventually have to say goodbye to her. It's so terrible it gets to the point I regret even getting her in the first place. The thought of losing her is unbearable, I can't even put it into words. I' can't stretch how terrified I am of feeling that kind of pain.

I tried pretty much everything, even living by the belief that once I die we will meet again and that her death would not be an actual final goodbye. It helped a bit, but not enough. I don't really know how to put this into words, but I'm absolutely miserable with these thoughts. Does anyone here have any tips on what I can do to ease them?

Thank you, and have a great day."

Anxiety,DAE hates waking other people up?,"Whenever someone asks me if I can wake them up it gives me so much anxiety.

It seems like a simple request, “hey, if you wake up before me, can you wake me up?”, and I always agree but when I actually have to do it I panic. 

Did they really ask me to do that? What if they didn’t expect me to wake up this early and will be annoyed that I woke them up? Do I touch them gently? Do I slap them? Will they get angry that I woke them up in the wrong way? 

And that makes me just stand there paralyzed unable to wake them up. Then I panic more because it’s creepy to stand over a sleeping person...

It’s pretty specific but maybe I’m not the only one :&lt;"

Anxiety,Subconscious anxiety,I am getting alot hypochondriac these days in lockdown. I don't think anything but still i get panic attacks and scared feelings.

Anxiety,Anybody have tips to get my ass to bring my car to the mechanic?,"I have been putting this off for weeks cause the mere thought of going gives me extreme anxiety. I've brought my car to this mechanic before but every time there was something, like I forgot to leave him the keys or some parts were missing, the manual was missing, whatever. 

Last time I went was 6 months ago to have a general check-up and he told me I should definitely have the brakes replaced by January which, of course, I didn't do and now I can literally hear metal grinding on metal every time I step on the brakes. I really really need to get this car back going but I'm scared.

Like, in theory I know he probably won't remember any of this and he won't care even if he did but my nerves are getting the better of me since I've had so many bad experiences in the past with him, which is in no way his fault but I'm scared I'll fuck something up again and due to my CPTSD I would 100% start crying if he in any way scolded or critisized me for not taking care of my car.

I'm freaking out but this is so important for me to do, any of you guys have any tips on how to get myself to do it? Would be very appreciated!"
Anxiety,I want everyone to feel accepted,"Last night, I hung out with my cousin and her newly male to female transgender friend (we’ll call her Amy, she’s 25). Amy was very nervous to go out in public as her and my cousin drove out of their way to come to a town (mine coincidentally) where she hoped she wouldn’t see anyone she knew, because the only people that know is her sister, my cousin and two other friends.. not even her parents know. Around 9:30pm, my cousin invited me out to meet her and Amy where I got to get to know her better, hear her story and her traumatic experiences with not understanding her sexuality until recently and her journey to coming out. We had a great time laughing and conversing, so much to the point that I lost track of time and left around 12:30am (had work at 6:30am today but it was worth it!! Lol). 

Amy told me during the night how she hadn’t gone out to drink since February and that was the most she’s felt confident in so long because she hadn’t ever talked to so many strangers at once that were so unbelievably nice to her (I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone, so I hadn’t even thought of the fact that someone else might not be used to it). After I went home, my cousin texted me at the end of the night that Amy told her she’s never felt so comfortable and accepted by anyone before us, and she said she’s had the best night she’s had in so long. I broke town in tears. The fact that a total stranger trusted me with something so huge, had an amazing time and would love to do it again made me feel so, SO happy. I know what it’s like to have social anxiety and to not feel accepted, to be bullied, and left out to dry, and all I want is for her is to feel accepted everywhere and to feel like herself with ease."
Anxiety,Increased panic attacks,"I’ve been having panic attacks more and more often in the past few months. Before isolation (because of COVID) it happened less often but now it’s about every other day or twice a week. I am currently not taking any medication, I usually just try to occupy my mind with work or my dogs but it’s like I’m trapped inside my own head and I don’t seem to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have a very supportive fiancé but even then I feel like I constantly disappoint him by not being strong enough to control my emotions and I can’t even explain how it happens so often now. 

It’s hard to sleep, hard to wake up, hard to even get out of bed. Yesterday I had a really bad panic attack that lasted about 30-45min. I had this urge to make myself stop feeling and at the same time I was so scared I was going to pass out cause my whole body was shaking. I was so mad at myself that I did punch myself in the legs multiple times because (I know it’s fucked up) somehow I feel like I should be punished for feeling this way and not being able to get over it. My family and friends are not very supportive or just not around since they all live far away from me so I just want to know what has helped others. I’m considering maybe starting medication since I’m really not able to stop myself from having panic attacks so often even though I see a therapist and I’m just tired. I don’t want to push away the only person who cares for me because of how fucked up beyond repair I am. 

If anyone is experiencing or has experienced this please advice what has helped or what coping mechanisms are working better for you specially now that we can’t really gather together with others. I’d really appreciate it."
Anxiety,Short-term experiences with Effexor?,I’ve been going through a rough hurdle in life so my doctor prescribed me Effexor XR 37.5mg and told me I could just take it for two weeks and stop whenever I wanted. I just wanted to see if anyone else has tried Effexor for a short period of time and how effective it was. Based on what I’ve seen I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try taking it if I’m going to have to taper off or get withdrawal symptoms.
Anxiety,I did an interview and my anxiety has immediately shifted....,"So I was very anxious for this job interview I had today. I prepped for days and I even took sleeping meds last night to make sure I slept. I still didn’t sleep as long as I wish I would have. Nonetheless, I did it. The interview was fine. Not the greatest as I haven’t interviewed for several years, but I didn’t lose my words too much. My issue is about midway through the interview I noticed that my anxiety shifted. I started to be concerned about whether this job would work out or not. I think this coincided with him starting to talk about me as though I was already working there. 

Now I am uneasy about the whole thing. I haven’t been offered the job but he told me he thought I would be getting an offer. Why can’t I just be normal? Why does everything need to feel like life and death? Intellectually I know it’s not but emotionally I feel like a child. Please tell me I’m not alone! Anyone have a positive outcome to share about interviewing and starting a new job?"
Anxiety,"how do you all deal with nausea,heart palpitations, and the feeling of wanting to vomit? I’m really struggling",I had this really badly 3 or 4 years ago but it went away and it’s flared up again and I’m really struggling I can’t eat without feeling like I’m going to be sick and it goes away after an hour of sitting still however every time I try to leave the house to do anything I get really bad heart palpitations and my stomach feels really empty almost like the feeling of butterflies in the stomach and I find myself needing to constantly go to the toilet and feel extremely dizzy. I keep being sick outside aswell which really isn’t helping me get over my fear as I just think about the fact I might be sick and that makes me scared to go outside. does anyone else get like this cause I’m really struggling and need some support. and does anyone know any tips or anything on how to prevent nausea or get over This?

Anxiety,Not knowing if you genuinely dislike something or it's just anxiety,"Does anyone else sometimes doubt themselves when they find something not enjoyable, or even outright distressing? Everyone, anxious or not, faces situations that make them uncomfortable and they take actions to remove that discomfort. But occasionally I don't know whether something actually isn't for me, or if im just being irrational and anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I've recently returned to work since corona hit and my work has changed a bit, I really don't find it enjoyable anymore and I dread every shift. However, I'm not sure if quitting would be a sensible move to improve my quality of life, or if I should chalk this up to anxiety about returning to work and try to get over these feelings by staying, sort of like exposure therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

I also get it with relationships with other people - Is my anxiety ruining this or are they just a dick?"
Anxiety,Having terrible anxieties when interact with classmates who I’m not close to (even online),"As the title said, even my uni conducts classes online, my core courses still require mostly group projects. I feel terribly anxious just by talking to someone I’m not close to.
Today we had a group discussion, my other two group mates decided to invited 4 of their mutuals whom one of my group mate will have a group discussion with for their other projects after our talk is done. They wanted to video call and I just felt so anxious on the inside, though I was able to act normal. Some of them talk about their plans and I just really wanted to get out.
My heart raced even after the call ended. To think that I have to go through this again next trimester makes me feel hopeless.

Anxiety,It will get better,"I know that's what you hear all the time and you just wanna punch that person in the face when they say it but it's true. Depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain causing it to trigger anxiety and depression in situations that isn't appropriate.  You just gotta push through it and not stop fighting. Get help, I know a lot of people on this subreddit have either heard or had bad experiences with mental health professionals. If that person isn't doing the trick for you, then find a new therapist. Don't quit therapy and just say fuck it. If you have had a bad experience with medications then it's because it was the wrong prescription. They way all that works with getting the right meds, it's purely trial and error. It's not always the first try that the doctor gets it right. NO ONE CAN HELP YOU BUT YOU. I battled depression for only about a year but it was a pretty bad case. I became recluse and started failing classes, losing friends. I had to go through not one, not two, but 4 different med changes before they got it right, and Med changes suck cus sometimes for a couple weeks it worsens the symptoms. But you gotta push through. After attempting suicide I ended up in a mental hospital scared shitless, I didn't want to be there at all. But it made a huge positive impact on my mental health immediately. Depression and anxiety can be a real bitch. But what I heard the most often was the sooner you get help, the better, the reason why med changes and therapy sucks is because it's creating a war inside your head. And the earlier you get help the better. There's a whole life out there waiting for you. Don't give it up and don't let go of it, it will get better, and life after you concur it will be even better because you beat it. I love you guys, you have gotten me through a lot of hard times. You just gotta stick through it. I promise you that this hell hole your stuck in will one day get better and you won't realize it until your looking back and realize, you can't have happiness with out sadness. The low points are what shows you and makes you appreciate the highs. But only you can make a difference so take that first step and get some help. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

Anxiety,Did having an anxiety disorder ruin your dreams? Or career plans?,"I had some careers I planned out for my future, but thanks to developing an anxiety disorder at 18 I kissed those goodbye. My friend is living out my dream and while I try to be happy and supportive for her, it's killing me on the inside. I've worked very hard on my mental health and I've came a long way but not being able to follow my dreams have put a damper in me. I chose an alternative career path but it's still not something I truly want to do... so I accept that I'm just trying to make money to enjoy the time I don't work... but I still feel useless."
Anxiety,Flushed my meds down the toilet in the middle of a panic attack. Don’t know how to tell my doctor?,"Hi guys. I posted this on the Lexapro subreddit but thought I might get good results here as well. 


I was recently started on 10mg of Lexapro from a psychiatrist I just switched away from. My new psychiatrist agreed that I should be on Lexapro for generalized anxiety. 

I told her that the first day I had a really bad panic attack in the night and i was spooked. I’ve had doubts about being started at 10mg but she said to continue for the week. 

Well last night I had a HORRIBLE panic attack in the middle of the night. I couldn’t stop trembling, I was having cold sweats, and I thought my heart would stop beating it was going so fast. I was in an absolute state of frenzy and so scared, I dumped the Lexapro down the toilet. I was terrified of them or feeling that way again. 
I was prescribed hydroxyzine and I tried taking that in the beginning of the panic attack but 10 minutes in I threw up, which idk if it was a side effect or the extreme panic attack. 

Anyway now I have no medication left and I’m supposed to continue taking it for the week before seeing my psych on Tuesday to discuss it. I’m so embarrassed that i did that and I have no idea how to tell her what happened. I don’t want to sound absolutely insane. I’ve never in my life done anything like that and that was definitely the worst panic attack I experienced so far. I don’t necessarily think i was thinking straight and was definitely in fight or flight mode. How do i approach this topic with my psych?

Has anyone experienced bad panic attacks on Lexapro??"
Anxiety,Melanoma fear ruining wedding proposal — what can I do?,"My mother has been very sick and has been in and out of the hospital. My boyfriend has always been such an important support to me. I know he is planning on proposing soon. It is supposed to be the happiest time of my life, but anxiety has gotten in the way. I am convinced that I will lose him somehow. My latest worry is a mole he has on his back. He’s had it for years, and despite being slightly odd looking it has not changed at all. I try to reassure myself that he is okay, but I keep having horrible dreams of him dying from melanoma. He said he will get his skin checked for me when he starts his new job this fall. How can I enjoy his proposal (which I expect this summer) when all I can think about is losing him? What if it’s cancer? What if he dies? Thoughts like this keep racing through my mind. How can I possibly enjoy this time?"
Anxiety,Propranolol withdrawal,"I was taking Propranolol(40mg) for about 5 days and I was wondering if I made the right decision to give em up this early on?

Anxiety,Hey guys I made a breakthrough this morning,"This lockdown bullshit (thanks China) has ruined my mental health to levels never thought possible. I’ve realized after all these years , my “anxiety” is actually chronic insecurity that’s never been addressed. I’ve always been a worrier and very sensitive as a kid. I think my brain is naturally hypersensitive so I pick up on things others don’t. It’s pretty much fucked me in life and caused me chronic anxiety, stress, insomnia and depression that’s lasted well over 15 years. These conditions have lead to a loss of motivation and energy which means my physical health has suffered as well. 10 years of SSRIs , anti psychotics, 5-6 diagnoses , sleep meds, sleep study, and therapy hasn’t helped. Sometimes things are simpler than they appear. I hope everyone is using this time to care of themselves and if given the opportunity, to figure out your root issues. You will save yourself  lots of time and money. Never too late to live!"

Anxiety,Please Help im scared..,"Hi,, so on june 6th i first started to have anxiety but i didn't exactly know that at first until i went to the doctors, they said i was physically fine and there was nothing wrong with my lungs or heart. So from what my father told me i wasn't going to have a heart attack or anything. Let me add what im feeling though before i really get into the story so you all will understand. I have shortness of breath (which is what bothers me the most right now) dizziness, my vision is weird right now, ive had panic/ and or anxiety attacks, trouble sleeping, and stomach problems. I have a really high fear of dying and just death in general but but its worse since thats what im feeling and i really don't want to die... im only 14 years old btw going to be 15 in September.

Anxiety,I always put too much on my plate and then I get panick attacks,"I always take on too many obligations and tasks at once. Too many deadlines and too many things to do. I'm so anxious right now I feel like I'm going to explode. 

I have clients asking me to do this and that. I haven't worked out in a few days, I'm gaining weight due to quarantine, my room is a mess. My girlfriend wants to watch a movie with me. 

I don't have enough time and energy!

How do you guys handle a lot of tasks despite your anxiety?"
Anxiety,One of my ordinary days,"My phone is ringing in the morning. Oh no, it's an unknown number. Just let it ring until they hang up, it's probably someone calling a wrong number or a telemarketer. Why is the same number calling me again? It's obvious they are after me. Whatever I'll still ignore it. No more calling thank god.

Time to leave my apartment as I put on my sunglasses, even though it's overcast outside. I peek and listen through the door lock because god forbid I bump into anyone in the corridor. No one's there time to get out. Oh sh\*t, someone's unlocking their door. I run down the stairs and rush out of the building.

Walking on the street I spot a huge gang of teens in front of me. I won't risk potentially being annoyed by them so I take an alternative path.

Going to the supermarket to buy my food. I'm afraid of checking out since I only have a €50 note and paying for only €4.11 worth of stuff, the cashier will probably look at me weird. I hand her the note, she inserts it into the fake money detector. Oh my god, it's beeping!. She wrinkles the note and inserts it again, all good this time. Almost had a heart attack. She gives me the change and I'm panicking to pick up all the cents as there's an entire line waiting on me. Finally I'm out of there and head back home safely."

Anxiety,How can I (24f with anxiety) be a better partner for my boyfriend (26m) who does not have anxiety ?,"Hi everyone! Looking for advice on how I can help my partner better deal with my anxiety. He on,y recently confided in me that there are times that it gets to be too much emotional support for him. He’s been there for me and is a great partner and we’ve been together for 3 years. He’s happy I’m going to therapy, so some burden will be eased off him. I was not aware he was feeling this way,and has been by y side regardless. I want to be a better partner for him.

Anxiety,"Breakup because s/o had anxiety, please help","First, I apologize for the wall of text.  It just kept on coming out.

I had not dated in two years, due to just not being lucky in picking a good partner, for whatever reason.  Then, I met HER.  I met her online, as we shared a common interest.  We would casually chat, then one evening, she sent me her number and said, ""Call me, I'm over this chat thing.""  I thought it was a little fast and I asked if it was only as friends and she said ""yes""... yeah, right.  I was a bouncer for ten years and I'm about as extroverted as they come.

It progressed from chat, to talking on the phone, to Skype (and ""everything"" associated with it).  I usually date tiny, petite women.  She was a little, what she called ""thick"".  I didn't see it, but eh.  But, I thought maybe it would be good to get outside my usual dating choices.

I thought she was wonderful.  She was caring and giving, which were two things that I wasn't used to in a relationship. She had this teased, curly strawberry blonde hair and brown doe eyes.  At this point, there wasn't anything that I didn't like about her.  I'm big on trust.  If you don't have trust in a relationship, what's the point of being together?  After three months, she started slipping words into our conversation like ""boyfriend"" and ""you're the one for me"".  I let it go, even though she had expressed she wasn't ready for a relationship.  I thought she was coming around to the idea, so I let it go.  Then one day out of the blue, she says, ""I can't do this.""  Then, she just shuts everything down and says that we can be friends, but that's it.  I couldn't understand how she could just turn off her emotions and be like, ""Deal with it.""  I was hurt.  I tried to ask her if I did something wrong and she became combative.  We argued for a day and I gave up.  We didn't speak for ten days.

We started talking again, and a week later, we were right back into where we were, pre-flake out.  My gut feeling told me that something was ""amiss"", but when you really like someone, you don't listen to it.  She lived in the middle of the US and I, in the NE.  We had thrown around the idea of going down to see her (even though I swore to myself I would not do that).  She was always on the fence about it, then one day she brought it up, saying ""that she would love it if I came down to see her"".  I set a date that was a month out, ""just in case"".  I had to juggle the flights three times because something was always wrong on her end.  Now my gut feeling is getting stronger because she has already flaked out on me once.  I bring it up and she said, ""I PROMISE that I will not flake out on you this time.  Trust me, baby!""  

Fast forward 25 days... it seems like she's trying to put up little ""roadblocks"" to keep me from coming down.  I ask her if she's still okay with me coming down to see her and she says that she's excited to see me.  I was supposed to stay at her place, then two days before I'm supposed to be there, she decides that I should stay at a hotel (the nearest decent one was an hour and a half away, one way).  I told her if it meant that much to her, I'd sleep in the SUV in her driveway.  I asked her how I could have sex with her, but she won't trust me to sleep at her place.  She was the one that brought it up that I should stay at her place.  It would have cost me another $500 to get a hotel room for my stay AND it would have been a three-hour round trip to see her.  She says that all of her friends have been telling her that it was a bad idea.  That was another thing, she would let some of her friends influence how she acted towards me.  Where she was anxious about things, she always commented on how she loved how I could ground her and put her at ease.  I completely missed this because I know nothing about anxiety.

If I would have cancelled the rental car and flights to see her, 24 hours beforehand, I could have had a full refund of nearly $500.  I paced in front of the clock, thinking I should just cancel, because by now the little voice is screaming at me.  I wanted SOOO bad to be able to believe in her and trust her, so I let it go.  I call her to let her know that everything is all set and I'll see her tomorrow.  She tells me that she started her period, even though it ended ten days ago.  I'm thinking, ""and there it is, the trump card"".  I told her that it wouldn't stop us going out to dinner and doing things.  She starts trying to gaslight me, calling me a liar about something completely off the wall.  She said, ""that I forced her to like me for six months"" and ""that I forced her to let me go there and see her"".  I'm like, what the hell is going on here?  THEN, she tells me that she doesn't want to talk to me any more AND she's getting back with her ex, who is married with kids.  This guy, who she said was ""not good for her"" the whole time we were speaking.  She tells me, ""Don't come down here.  I'm getting back together with him and you coming here won't change a thing.""  I told her that she could have told me this six hours ago and I wouldn't have wasted $500.  She didn't care one bit.  This was all over text.  I practically begged her to call me and she said that she didn't have the time right now.

I'm devastated.  She crushed my heart, then blocked my cell number and on a chat we were on.  All I can think about now, is how she is with her married ex and here I am, hurt as hell when I should have just followed my gut feeling.  I want so bad to mail her a letter, asking for some kind of explanation.  I know that we'll never be getting back together.  It's probably a good move if I never contact her again, but it's so damn hard right now to suppress that.  It's been 12 days since all of that occurred and I'm still thinking of her and what went awry.  My brain won't stop thinking about it.

I'm hoping that someone here can please shine some light on this for me.  I've been reading articles on the internet about how anxiety can destroy a relationship, but hearing it from someone would be better.  I'd like to think that if someone really cares about someone, they could conquer their anxiety.  After all of the reading that I've done, it appears that I'm holding out on false hope.  I miss her so bad and being a man, I don't know where to put all of this.  It's not something that I've ever experienced.  Thank you so much to anyone that can give me any kind of positive feedback!

TL;DR My ex s/o has an anxiety issue.  She crushed my heart for what seems to me, for no reason.  As an added bonus, she intentionally said some things to hurt me further.  Words were exchanged over text and now, she has completely shut me out of her life."
Anxiety,extremely frustrated,"the first thing i’ve ever been prescribed for anxiety was lexapro. i didn’t like it and it didn’t really help me honestly. i expresses these concerns to my therapist, but after AT LEAST a month with no meds at all, when i went to get my medicine to day it was escitalopram. which is fucking lexapro. i don’t even know if i want to take it. smh. this is so annoying. i don’t think i need an ssri because it didn’t help the last time!"
Anxiety,Anxiety crept up on me gradually as I got older and now it's impacting every aspect of my life and feels completely and utterly unmanageable and I want to tell it to just do one.,"My anxiety started off as mild and temporary when I would get bullied at school and it would go away (e.g. on the weekends). Slowly and gradually my anxiety has moulded into this monstrous form, esp. when it comes to people: strangers, relatives, friends, going to the supermarket or in public by myself, work colleagues. All these kind of situations create this sick heavy feeling in my stomach. I want to quit my (fairly new) job just to get out of connecting with colleagues because I'm so incredibly awkward/lacking self confidence and the idea of going back to work after quarantine makes it seem even harder. 

Does anyone else feel like this and any idea how I even begin to remedy this? I've tried numerous therapy sessions, all of which haven't had longterm success. I'm also on mirtazapine and quetiapine.   


TL;DR - Social anxiety has become unmanageable. Have tried therapy and am on antidepressants/anxiety meds. What the mother of fuck do I do."
Anxiety,How do I (25F) overcome my fears about the future and enjoy my relationship?,"My parents had a terrible divorce, mainly caused by my mother's worsening mental state. I was forced to witness her deteriorating condition from the age of 15 and this experience has been affecting me ever since (25 now). In addition to that, I have an anxiety disorder.

I have history of trust issues in romantic relationships and ended a long-term relationship because of the crippling anxiety it was causing me (I was terribly anxious about him cheating). I actually had the opportunity to talk to my ex years later and ask him whether he ever did something inappropriate - he said no, and confessed to me that he was always curious about why I was so nervous all the time.

Now, these fears are consistent to this day. I have a boyfriend now and we've been dating for more than a year. I'm really happy with him and am thinking of having a family and moving in together after he graduates college. However, my fears are plaguing me once again - I'm terribly afraid he will cheat, I will spiral down into mental illness just like my mother - you name it, for some reason everything is going to explode into flames and my life will be ruined. Now, these fears come and go but when they come, they're especially bad. I have been in therapy for a month now, but I wanted to hear some (more experienced) opinions.

So my question is: how do you let go of the fears that something will go terribly wrong along the way (even though there's no evidence to think so)? How do you bravely start a family, being 100% confident that everybody will be happy and that you and your partner are a good match? How do you devote to someone, not being 100% sure he will not do something bad later on (because we never know, do we?)?"
Anxiety,My Anxiety is ruining my relationship,"CW: Anxiety, Panic Attacks

When I had my first panic attack about 3 or 4 years ago I became so agoraphobic that I was trapped in my house for weeks. I managed to slowly push my boundaries again until I could get a comfortable job close by and go to some local places with friends and visit family.

With the pandemic I’ve been laid off since March and my boyfriend has as well. Now that things are starting to reopen here I have awful panic.

My boyfriend has said he’s starting to resent the fact that I can’t do a lot of things with him- like go to the beach or to family bbqs. Somehow this makes it even harder to try and do these things because I feel like I have to perform well and if I don’t succeed my relationship is on the line. 

I try really hard to keep my anxiety from affecting his life- I stopped going to live music shows with him because I didn’t want him to have to focus on me at all, I don’t want to go to the beach with him because of I had to leave it would absolutely ruin his day.

I just don’t really know what to do- I know I can’t push myself if I don’t do these things but at the same time I really don’t want him to have to babysit me having panic attacks every time we get in the car."
Anxiety,"Over the last few years, I accidentally ""Pavloved"" myself out of panic attacks","I've dealt with depression and anxiety for the last 8 years. When I was in college and had a panic attack, I would throw on Friends to calm down and distract myself. Apparently, over the last 8 years, I've classically conditioned myself to the point where hearing the opening theme from Friends instantly calms me down. 

I didn't realize it until I started having a panic attack at work, and finally decided to put Friends on in the background while I tried to get my work done. Sn 1 Ep 1 starts with the theme instead of a cold open, and as the first guitar lick came through my headphones, I literally felt a wave of relief wash over me. It was instantaneous. I was embarrassed and ashamed at first (classic anxiety...) Before I realized how cool it was that I conditioned myself out of a panic attack. 

I just wanted to share. I thought it was neat. Does anyone else have any tricks like this they accidentally picked up?"

Anxiety,Hangxiety onto day 3,"Got a little to excited on the fourth and had several beers and a mixed drink. I've been in hell since then. Sunday just classic hangover symptoms nausea and bed ridden. But that night it seemed like I was coming out of it, WRONG. I lay down for bed and I'd feel tremors in chest and neck and arms. I was afraid to lay down because it seemed like the more I laid down the more intense the tremors would get. Fitbit pulse was much higher than normal jumping like 30 beats. Finally fell asleep only to wake up with the shaky foggy head and arm weakness and restlessness. My whole Monday was like that. Today I wake up and it's slightly better but still foggy head and restless arms.

At first I thought it was worse because I took way too much of a thiamine supplement. However Just found out that Hangxiety is a thing and needed to vent. I'm not sure what I can do to help it other than try to do my usual schedule and not panic about a seizure. Sometimes shaking my own legs purposely makes my symptoms go away. Hopefully it goes away completely by Thursday I feel like a prisoner in my own body"

At random times, I remember what may have caused my unhealthy obsession on getting things right to the point of anxiety and burnout.

In class, I was called out by my teacher because I had two mistakes in the exam. My response was just to smile through all her hurtful words about my (in)competence. I was 12 years old. Last thing I remember she said to me was ""And you are just smiling?""

I got the highest mark in the whole class. I had been singled out for that kind of scolding.

Normally my anxiety has me just sit through it until it's over, I don't like correcting people. But it began to hurt so much I winced and indicated my lip was hurting.

The dentist checked my lip, then his tool which he said overheated, so it burned me (and had been for some time).

He kept apologizing and my anxiety didn't want to make him feel bad, I said it didn't hurt anymore (which it didn't). I also mentioned how I had a ton of burn salves and creams at home (which is also true). So I just acted like it was no big deal and I wasn't worried.

When I got home and checked it, it was a lot worse than I had thought. The burn goes from my lip to my inner cheek, andis about 1 mm deep, 2 cm wide, and 1 inch long. It's bad. My husband is really upset about it. He says I should sue.

Thing is, my anxiety about it is preventing me from any sort of recourse. I played it off as nbd at the dentist, I hate the thought of making them pay when I was so cool about it before.

Now it's day 2 and like the worst canker EVER and is making eating/talking really difficult.

I'm just so upset my anxiety prevented me from reacting seriously, and doing anything about it now. I get it was an accident, but I got pretty hurt and all I can do is protect the dentist's feelings. And I got no compensation for it. Still paid full price for a tiny filling and a giant burn."
Anxiety,Work anxiety. Will I ever be able to get a job?,I have alot of anxiety surrounding not being good enough for a job and thinking I'll screw it up and it's made me realize that If I cant even do a simple job thats part time or something then how the hell am I going to get a full time job which has even more responsibilities. I have absolutely no confidence and I screw things up all the time. How am I supposed to get over it?
Anxiety,I’m extremely afraid of car accidents..,"I don’t drive because I’m underage, but I’m getting to the age where I’d be old enough to drive and I was super excited. Until I realized how many people lost someone to a car accident. So I searched up the statistics and it said more than 90 people die in car accidents everyday..."
Anxiety,Can’t breathe 24/7,"
I am 23 years old, I have suffered with anxiety and panic attacks since childhood but no physical health issues for some background information. For the last few months When trying to breathe in it feels like I'm only getting half the oxygen I should be getting. I cant quite describe the sensation I feel when I breathe just that its not normal and doesnt feel right and I'm not inhaling as well as I used to. Like I’m suffocating and it feels extremely constricted. It’s not it getting into my lungs I’m concerned about it’s the process of it entering my airways where it feels strained. This lasts all day every day till i go to sleep and I am now confined to my room as I'm too terrified to do anything in case I stop breathing and die. Here are the things I've tried: *Anxiety/Depression Medication (2 different kinds with no effect) *Lung function/Spirometry test (Normal results) *ENT visit with camera up nose and down throat checking the throat and vocal cords (Everything was normal) *Blood test (all normal) *Tried a generic allergy medication (no effect) *Oxygen levels are always 96-100 *ECG (normal results) I'm sure there is more but this is what I remember off the top of my head. I do have anxiety but the root of this issue is not that. I do have some anxiety attack type things happen but that's only when I'm really struggling to breathe and the panic sets in. My doctor insists its anxiety but I'm not convinced as it feels too real. I am very careful not to exert myself and walk extra slowly as not to get out of breath because i feel if I get out of breath then my breathing won't resume to 'normal' and whatever this problem is will worsen and I'll end up in hospital. Any advice, ideas, etc... would be greatly appreciated of if anyone's going through the same thing I’m just at my wits end with it all. I constantly have bad thoughts and suicidal tendencies due to this. I’m still convinced it’s something physical as how can this be psychological? It’s 24/7 I never get a break from it. It’s so strained and it’s not so much the air getting into my lungs it’s like the process of it entering my airways and travelling down to my lungs that feels like the problem if that makes sense? Like I’m constantly being suffocated. I don’t even know if that would show up on the tests I’ve had. All my symptoms seem to be so different from what I’ve seen other people go through. Also im scared to get out of breath if i do anything to exert myself.  I’m terrified of it. I feel like if that happens it will trigger whatever it is that isn’t being picked up on tests and it will take getting out of breath to reveal what the breathing problem is if that makes sense? I feel like I sound like I’m going insane saying it. Because if it already feels so strained I can’t imagine what it would be like getting out of breath and not regaining it. can someone answer me that"
Anxiety,Was dumped. Haven't been myself.,"If I'm not even posting in the right place, please direct me to where I can find some sort of fucking catharsis.

A three and a half year relationship with my boyfriend ended a few days ago. It wasn't exactly the most amicable of breakups.

We were supposed to go on our first vacation this weekend and I booked a super bougie airbnb. I can't cancel for a full refund and I've spoken to the host if I can find someone else. I'm still losing out on a lot of money. He didn't pay for his half of the trip yet. He was gonna give me his half within the next few weeks.

I don't wanna sleep in my bed, I've been on the couch all week. I've been waking up late-night with sweaty chills, but no fever. I feel really bloated and nauseous every morning, but nothing comes out. I've lost my appetite, but then I get hungry, and then I can't find myself being able to eat. This feeling lasts for hours in the morning/through the afternoon until I somehow magically kinda forget the whole thing ... Then I cry over literally anything and everything that even reminds me of him. I haven't told my friends or family about it yet. I'm home alone. My family is about a thousand miles away. I've just got two cats here to keep me kinda sane.

I feel like my very few friends aren't really gonna care. I pretty much have no one to talk to. Idk what to do. I've lost my drive to just fucking do anything. I've been a fucking couch potato just crying and sleeping and trying not to think of the nausea and everything. I feel like if I throw up it'll be better, but nothing wants to come out.

Kinda feeling like I'm just repeating myself now."
Anxiety,This is Why Anxiety Sucks,"So almost exactly a month ago I started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist to finally try and get my act together. The psychiatrist started me on 50mg Zoloft for anxiety/PTSD and it was not a good time. I ended up in the ER the same day I took it I was having such a bad panic attack; my first one in YEARS, and had tons of shivers and was twitching.

Since then (so like 3 weeks) every morning I’ve been waking up already in a panic attack. Usually once I start my day the anxiety starts creeping in and I haven’t had an actual panic attack in years...I used to get them from smoking or drinking. But now not anymore lol I just wake up and I’m already thinking I’m going to die and I can’t stop

I saw my psychiatrist again yesterday and told him the Zoloft still hadn’t settled in my system and he switched me to 10mg Prozac. But I’m terrified to take it...
Ever since the initial Zoloft dose my anxiety has spiraled to be completely unmanageable in the mornings when I used to just be stressed but at least semi functional all day :( I never went out or did things like drive thrus or anything outside my comfort zone, but I could go to work and get out of bed. Now I can’t even move from a balled up position in my bed for like an hour.
Part of me thinks I had such a bad reaction bc I don’t actually have anything wrong with me? Maybe I’m not actually anxious and it’s all in my head and I just need to try harder to think positive and breathe and use the other techniques my therapist is giving me??? My parents never believed in being anything but happy/neutral; sadness and anger and all those negative emotions are bad and just a ploy for attention. So maybe I actually am anxious and it’s just my parents in my head telling me that I’m exaggerating and that I’m ok and I SHOULD take the meds bc Obvs why would the doctor prescribe them??? Like it’s just the anxiety talking when I’m doubting my anxiety...right?

AGH my brain is an absolute mess and it’s hard to even take myself seriously!!! Sorry this was a rant but thanks for letting me get it off my chest."
Anxiety,Hi I am taking buspar in the doses of 5mg throughout the day. I take it multiple times whenever I feel anxious. Totaling up to 40-45 mg a day. Is this a bad way to use buspar or is it better to take 15mg three times a day? Can anyone help me answer this ?,
Anxiety,I’m so sick with anxiety,"I don’t know what happened. I was doing somewhat okay and then something happened and now I’m super anxious. I think it’s a combination of things like being worried for my future, climate change anxiery , political/news anxiety, when I will get my drivers license, taking summer classes, my parents in Florida, and etc. 

And I’m like so sick of people telling me “the reason why you’re so anxious is because you need to occupy your time and stay busy”. Bitch even when I’m busy I’m still anxious as fuck! my head honestly feels like it’s on fire- probably just a tension headache. 

And then I feel guilty for being this way because I want to put anxiety behind me. I’m sick of it I want to get rid of it. And yes I do see a therapist once a month who I like and I think is good. I’m like 21 ducking years old and I’m a fucking slob who sits home all day. It’s miserable living life this. But then I fear what life will be like if I actually start to tackle my anxiety and do things that challenges me. Idk it’s this circle of me wanting to challenge myself getting scared then picking on myself for not being able to do it. Blah"
Anxiety,I have mastered anxiety control i no longer have anxiety.,Just joking! I feel good now but you can bet ur ass ill think im gonna die tonight! Stay positive!

Anxiety,Freaking out and don't know if I should be...,"Hi! So I just started anti anxiety meds for the first time 5 days ago. My doctor prescribed 25mgs of Sertraline (Zoloft). The first few days were rough, but I was starting to feel better, until I woke up this morning and my pupils are huge. No other symptoms, I don't feel bad, no pain, swelling etc. Just huge pupils. My doctor said it probably wasn't even the med since eye dilation only occurred in less than 2% of people, but other than a new glasses prescription, this is the only thing that has changed. Am I dying? Has this happened to anyone else?"
Anxiety,I had a free short therapy session over the phone and I know that therapy is for me!,"It was literally 15 minutes long but the guy had the softest, most non judgemental and calm voice and he really gave me hope I can get through this.

Anxiety,Health-related anxiety has been hitting me like a truck recently (physically/mentally). Finally opened up to my doctor about my anxiety after a year + received diagnosis,"New to this sub. I started browsing posts and feel comfort in knowing I’m not alone. 


About 2 weeks ago I had a headache for like 3 days which I mean, I get headaches sometimes but it’s typically due to my lack of eating and my anemia. However I’ve never had it last that long. I was convinced I had COVID or SOMETHING. I took off work to quarantine while I waited for results. Once the headache went away, I had muscle aches, stiff neck/back, diarrhea, lose of appetite. None of the big respiratory issues though..I took TWO tests and received negative results on both. 

I started googling symptoms and Reddit subs, convinced I had a brain tumor or even leukemia. 

This sent me into a frenzy. I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t sleep. I was afraid I would die in my sleep. I kept most of these thoughts to myself because I didn’t wanna admit to my bf, friends, family of my ‘crazy’ fears. I’d wake up in the middle of the night after barely sleeping crying and panicking to the point I almost went to an urgent care. 

I ended up setting up an appointment with my doctor, which I saw last August. I explained my worries and concerns and he didn’t downplay them, but was pretty sure I didn’t have any of the illnesses I thought I had. However, he did say we could do blood work to rule out the leukemia. He also prescribed me trazodone to help me sleep and 10mg paroxetine. 

Received my lab results today and everything is fine. The iron levels in my blood even went up! He wants me to come back in 2 weeks to follow up on medication. 

I still have one worry. The brain tumor. Now that I know it isn’t corona, it HAS to be something? I’ve never had these weird sensations before... but I’ve also never experienced prolonged anxiety like this. I feel this butterfly feeling in my stomach.. weird muscle aches / cramps... stiffness in my upper back/neck... I just don’t know. I want to ask for a referral to get an MRI to check my brain. 


To people I sound so irrational but it’s just so fucking hard to stop. It’s hard to not google my symptoms. It’s hard to not worry and panic. I don’t want to be afraid anymore. I don’t want to overthink everything. I’m tired.. 

I need therapy :("

Anxiety,What to say when your parent says “I don’t know where I went wrong as a parent”,"understandably during this pandemic I’ve chosen to isolate myself. My mom and stepdad live together and they both have been infected  with Covid and have since recovered. However I’m still choosing to be distant, setting boundaries and only seeing them outdoors at a distance.

I have been going through depression through all of this, and she always finds a way to make it an attack on her."

Anxiety,Lorazepam randomly not working after 4 months.,"I've been on lorazepam for about 4.5 months now in order to help with some anxiety issues. The medication mostly did the job but now I'm trying to come off it. I was previously on 1mg but cut down to 0.5mg for the last month and a half which made me feel depressed and anxious every single day until randomly one day I woke up and felt a lot better about my anxiety issues rather than them being gone. For the last few weeks I've been great but then yesterday I wasn't able to take it in the morning as I'd been given the wrong medication and I felt a bit more down about everything than usual which prompted me to go to the pharmacist to get the right one and take it but I didn't start to feel any better afterwards and that's continued through to today.

I don't understand what happened? I just took it about 4 hours later than I usually would on one day and now I feel like absolute shit again. I'm meant to be leaving my parents' tomorrow and move to my new house, why the fuck did this have to happen now??? Does anyone know if this is normal?"
Anxiety,A physical description of my anxiety rn:,"A feeling like my body wants to scream and cry: a deep, inflamed emotional pain at the center of my lungs, and my arms and legs, that I wish I could scream out to release.

Like a white, hot, buzzing fluorescent light in my brain.

Like I need to yawn. 

Like my blood is liquid rage and pain. 

Like I’m endlessly running away from something, even as I’m in the fetal position on my couch.

Like I want to hide in a dark closet but am also scared Of the closet.

Like a feeling of being a toddler lost in a park and not knowing where your parents are.

Like being too hot and too cold at the same time.

Like utter exhaustion. 

It’s bad today."
Anxiety,"I talked with my downstairs neighbors, and I actually stayed and cried only a tiny bit.","My downstairs neighbors have been having a hard time with the way we walk around upstairs. Our floors are really thin, and having a toddler cooped up during quarantine doesn’t help. They have definitely thumped the ceiling with their broom several times in protest to our unintentional noise. 

I finally decided it was time to go and talk to them while my boyfriend was out on a walk with my son. This was really big for me because I always avoid confrontation. 

When they answered the door, I immediately started trembling like a chihuahua. It was very noticeable. I introduced myself as their neighbor and explained the effort we were putting into accomadating them. One neighbor responded that our thin floors didn’t excuse the noise. I tried to explain more about the changes we have made, such as tiptoeing instead of walking and preventing my son from running. We even stopped allowing certain friends from to come over to avoid the noise complaints. I think they were just angry, because it seemed to escalate a lot in the beginning of the conversation. The way they responded seemed to me that they thought I was saying they were wrong. It took me a while to get across that I understood how they felt and just wanted to notify them that we are trying our very best making adjustments tonour lifestyle for them. 

Things seemed to calm down once I accidentally started crying. The nerves and stress from the situation really got to me. I saw their faces immediately change as the tears disgraced me. Things seemed to deescalate really fast once my eyes betrayed me. 

They described how the previous tenant above them called the police on them a bit for seemingly no reason. I suspected it might have been because of racism because of the ridiculous reasons they were reported for. They must have expected me to be the same kind of person as the previous neighbor. 

We were able to come to a compromise that they would come knock on our door if the sound was getting too much. There wasn’t much more we could offer since we have already drastically changed the way we live for them. 

I also expressed my hope that we could all be friendly and neighborly to each other. I hated the animosity between us and the neighbors. Now, maybe things can hopefully be more civil."
Anxiety,"Random Question, New to subreddit.","Hi, I've had Anxiety for most of my life (since I was 13/14 and I'm 28) started getting depression in my mid-teen years (was verbally/emotionally abused by ""friends"") and I started making my own like rules for how I could behave around people for awhile. (Anyone who knows me would be surprised I was anxious or depressed because I'm good at acting like I'm not, while my brain is freaking the f. out)

Well, in the last couple years I've gotten a therapist and started talking some medication. (Helped a lot, I was sleeping 12+ hrs, which was a combo of depression and 3 different types of anemia) and I started feeling better. I still have sessions with my therapist every few weeks. 

Anyway, my random question. I've been starting to get really tired again. Not sleeping or sleeping and not feeling rested. It's making me really anxious because I don't want to go back to sleeping 12+ hours again. I don't have an appt. with my therapist until the end of the month and it's really hard to get an appt. with my doctor right now due to everything.

Has anyone just ""gotten use to"" you're medicine? Where it seems to not be helping anymore? I'll ask him later this month but I'm having massive anxiety spikes right now, and it's making me nauseous and sick to my stomach. And I don't know what to really do about it. -\_-"

Anxiety,DAE feel like something bad will inevitably happen to them?,"**Content warning: Discussion of harm to family members, abuse**

The most severe symptom of my anxiety is the fear that something bad is going to happen to me or my loved ones. It's so bad that I sort of believe something bad *will* happen to me. For example, I'm convinced that I will either end up in an abusive relationship, my significant other/close family member will die, or that I will end up suffering in some way or another. Basically I believe that anything bad that could happen will.

I'm really lucky to only have really positive examples of love in my family, so I don't really know why my idea of love is so black pilled. Probably growing up online and being exposed to pretty graphic stories of abuse from a young age. Anyways, I just wanted to see if I was alone in this. I know fearing that something bad will happen is a common anxiety symptom, but is being convinced something bad will happen common?"
Anxiety,Zoloft and Buspar,"I had a massive panic attack last month. It was my first one and I didn’t know what was happening. I thought I was dying and went into vagal shock and nearly lost consciousness several times. My blood pressure bottomed out. Luckily I work at a surgery center, so I had a medical team to help me, but I still left work in an ambulance. I got to the ER only to be told it was anxiety. Since then, I have had anxiety nearly every day at work, so afraid of having another attack or going into shock. 

I decided to make an appointment with a psychiatrist, who promptly prescribed me 10mg of Buspar twice a day and 25mg of Zoloft. I’ve been on both since last Wednesday. It’s been less than a week. All has been perfect and the Buspar was helping curb anxiety during the day. But then last night happened. I took my Zoloft before bed, as instructed, but I began to feel weird. All the rest of the night, and all day today, I feel like there is electricity in my veins. I feel weird, wired, and agitated. Last night I was sweating and so hot, had a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. I wasn’t able to sleep. I tried napping today but still haven’t had any luck getting to sleep with this electric feeling in me. So I haven’t slept since Sunday night. My doctor is on vacation so the office told me to go to the ER to get checked out. The ER shrugged and said it’s just side effects and they can’t do anything. 

I am now petrified of the medicine. Everyone says to just stay the course and it gets better, but I can’t keep having anxiety attacks and calling off work. I feel like I’m going to die if I take more of the medicine. I’m so scared and anxious. I saw a psych nurse at the ER and he said a few things. 1. These two meds aren’t typically taken at the same time. 2. If I have more anxiety related symptoms than depression, then an SSRI probably isn’t right for me. 3. Usually Zoloft is taken in the morning, not at night. 

So now I have lost confidence in my doctor because she said the opposite of what the psych nurse is saying. I feel terrible, I feel panicked. I am terrified. I don’t know what to do."
Anxiety,Anyone else suffer from severe financial anxiety aggravated by the pandemic?,"My family grew up really poor and I had to watch my mom feed myself at her own expense. Because of this I developed financial anxiety that was fairly severe. With a lot of help and saving I managed to get myself to a point where I was able to buy things without regretting it for ages. 
Now with the pandemic, losing my job contract because of it and pretty much depleting my savings to survive I feel like all the progress I’ve ever made went down the drain. I’m not even sure how to deal anymore."
Anxiety,Does anyone experience anxiety about falling asleep?,"Every night I struggle to let myself rest. I guess I fear not having control over what happens in my mind as I sleep as well as not being able to control events outside of my body. I try to explain this to my family and friends but I feel crazy trying to describe it. I don't even like the feeling of being drowsy or sedated, so medications to help me sleep stress me out further."
Anxiety,Heartburn makes me anxious,Lately I’ve been controlling my anxiety pretty well if I feel it coming on I start grounding myself etc. But the one thing that really catches me out is if I have heartburn i feel like I get super anxious!! Which probably in turns make the heartburn worse. I suffer from GERD but was wondering if anyone else gets like that?
Anxiety,My panic attacks started again and i cant calm myself down,"I used to be on medication for panic attacks but i stoppee because i felt in control but recently college just started. Ive found myself unable to eat thinking about assignments tonight i found myself unable to find motivation and was sweating like crazy. I stood in front of the fan and an ant climbed up my leg and it freaked me out causing me to feel bugs all over me and really not able to calm down. My mom came in tried to defuse and it helped but i realized the time (almost 3am) caused me to panic again afraid of not having enough time to finish tomorrow and she basically walked out on me saying ""youre not 12 any more"" and shit. I get shes tired and just wants to sleep but i guess i needed someone to comfort me, but everything she said that was positive just made a thought of ""no youre childish, no youre not pretty you have just sweat buckets and you hairs wet from it"" instead of just taking the damn compliment. She got super upset i couldnt let it go and spent a while just laying down outside alone in the backyard at 3am it helped, but i just wish i wasnt so childish. 

I just want calm, cool and collected but im everything but. Idk if this is the best place to ask this sort of stuff but, have any of you had to learn to calm yourself down alone and if you have any advice.

Also im not here to complain about my mom she did her best and i knew it would have helped if positive comments didnt irrate me when im upset. Have any of you felt that before? Can i just get a grip of myself no medicine has worked so far and i dont know if im bad at communicating symptoms but my counselor never fully understood what i was trying to say same with my doctor. I dont know."
Anxiety,Feel like such a failure,"So me and my husband bought a house and it’s being completely redone. It has taken us a year and it’s finally starting to come toward the end and in good time due to me also being pregnant with our first child. But what I thought would be a fun task, going and shopping for paint, lights, furniture ect isn’t. I can’t bring myself to go to the store without completely panicking. I will get to the store and not be able to get out of my car cause my chest will get tight, arms weak heart beating fast. I feel like such a freak and a failure. I’m 22 but can’t go into a store it’s pathetic. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore."
Anxiety,Reminder to please take care of yourselves and pay attention to your triggers and especially to your limits.,"Hi all, 

Please remember to take care of yourselves and be mindful of your limits. I had been feeling a bad meltdown coming on for a few weeks and I learned the hard way today that I should not have ignored my body asking for what it needed. I ended up at the hospital tonight where they very kindly gave me fluids and rescue medication until I could breathe well, but I should have never let it get that bad. 

I am feeling better now, and I am here to remind you that taking care of yourself is the most important thing you can do. There is no shame in needing medicine. Listen to your body. Breathe. Your health comes first."
Anxiety,Insomniac that has night terrors. DAE experience this? What can I do to stop them?,"I have a fair share of childhood trauma and at a young age began having night terrors that ended in me waking up screaming. I developed insomnia that I haven't been able to shake since because I was scared to fall asleep. If I take melatonin or a sleeping aid, it just interrupts my sleep and makes my dreams disturbing. 

Eventually, I got the night terrors under control somehow to the point where I no longer scream, but I often silently cry or hyperventilate. I don't experience them nearly as often as I did when I was a kid, but when I do, they're still pretty severe. Sometimes they spiral into panic attacks. 

I can get the night terrors mostly under control to where they become a rare occurrence, and I actually haven’t had them more then once quarterly for a while. But, the last couple of months have not been great in terms of my anxiety levels and they’re flaring up again. I want to get better and sleep normal, consistently. Not just when my body’s had enough. I know the long term effects of sleeping habits like these can’t be good. 

I'm not really sure what this is, but nonetheless, I'm tired. I love enjoying waking up early and enjoying sleep but neither are really possible all the time. Even when I don't have night terrors, I usually have nightmares if I dream. They are usually pretty disturbing and realistic and leave me shaken up for a while after. 

I meditate, I run long distance - sometimes twice a day - I read before bed and stay off my devices but once they start I genuinely get scared to fall asleep again. 

Does anyone else experience this?"
Anxiety,my life feels pointless,"i'm 19. i graduated HS a year ago. all of my friends went into post secondary soon after and they tease me about how i'm not in school. i know it's a joke but, it still hurts. so badly. i don't think i'm going into school until a year from now, maybe not even then, and i feel absolutely inferior. i'm scared i'm going nowhere.
my family doesn't notice how sad i am all the time. they pass off me not eating, not being happy, not having energy, not speaking, not cleaning as me just being a lazy teen. i barely leave my room. i sleep all day and stay awake at night. even then, i cry until i can sleep some more. sometimes the only way i can sleep at proper times is if i cry hard enough or drink hard enough. i don't talk/text anyone often anymore because it feels like i'm such a bother to them all. i just want to be absorbed by the earth and watch everyone from a distance. does that even make sense..? i don't know anymore. i don't know what i'm doing with myself. there's so many things i want in life but it's like there's chains around my throat and my arms and legs that keep me from achieving it. i'm so full of sadness. i'm always thinking: what if everyone leaves? what if i go nowhere? what if i can never be happy? what if i can never reach any goals? what if i can never be better? there's so many negative possibilities to my life and im so scared. it lingers in the back of my mind every day and i hate it so much. i hate it. i can't stop crying. 

i'm so sorry for this rant, if it seems repetitive or anything. i don't mean to be so negative. i just can't go anywhere else. i just feel so trapped. i feel so alone."

Anytime I try to disconnect from reading the news online, I feel like I'm missing something important, like a big news story just happened and I didn't know about it, not knowing stuff like that bothers me for some reason.

I don't known if I'm just trying to get myself to panic or if it's something else, but it's draining catching myself going to /r/worldnews or Twitter for the 3rd time in an hour.

If I see any article relating to climate change or anything that may have an affect in the future, my brain just spirals into this catastrophic, apocalyptic thought spiral that is really hard to get out of."
Anxiety,Scared he’ll notice,"I wanna make this dude unfollow me on Instagram but I’m scared he’ll find out later on, one time I made someone unfollow me and they found out and got mad. Idk man. This dude kinda toxic and I’m scared if he might spread rumors that something if I made him mad."
Anxiety,Getting anxious when not stressed,"Have you ever been so anxious when things are going well? Whenever I do tasks, I always applied this principle ""Suffer now than later"". I think that principle is the pillar of my anxiety right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like something is missing. I am getting anxious for my loved ones especially my family. Is this worry an overreaction? Please help. My mind is thinking beyond the limits of what would happen in the future. My city is in the phase of recovering to the new normal. We know this pandemic will not eradicate quickly and I also think our local government is hiding the actual cases. It's halfway 2020 and I'm still afraid of this year can give to us."
Anxiety,I keep waking up scared and anxious,"Third day in a row that I've been waking up with a heavy heart, beating fast, and immediately on edge. I can't exactly say I'm goin through an easy part in life but I honestly don't have anything to be worried about... So why am I?

Am I scared that I'm still alone? Day in, day out? An I scared that my only friend will stop wanting to talk to me? Am I scared that I can never be my true self? Never be able to use my voice, because I'm scared of the consequences and because I'll never have a platform? Am I scared that I'll always be pushing people away, because I care about relationships too much? Am I scared that the world is going to change? Or worse, that it's not going to change? 

An I scared I'll never find love? I think I'm scared I'll never find love..."
Anxiety,Quarantine and losing touch with friends,"Finally got to see two of my best friends that I've known for the past 6 years and have helped me get through this last few weeks of high school now. I was super excited about seeing them but they almost seemed like they didn't care. And very fast my mind went from excited about seeing them to ""holy shit I'm such a prick for inconveniencing them like this so I can see then when I'm not even sure they want to see me"". I have always felt like I was slowly slipping away from them but now it's been faster and more apparent. Honestly, I've always felt like a burden to them. Like I'm holding them back or something like that."
Anxiety,Social media toxicity,"Hi all. I hope you are safe and doing well. I would just like to vent. I am suffering from extreme anxiety. 8 years ago when I was diagnosed with depression and ptd. So from then, I am trying to help myself cope. I rarely open up my social media accounts because of what's currently going on in our country  (PH). Government is consistently making clown shows and their puppets are making fake accounts of legit person and will post something stupud and will send it to the authority so that person/people will be red tagged and be arrested. and so troll accounts to bully those who are opposing them. My mental health is currently suffering not to mention, I lost my job due to covid.

I feel like I keep on making bad decisions like a month ago, I decided to buy a nintendo switch so I could have something to do. Because I don't want to suffer from another episode as I have nothing with me anymore. anyway, Little did I know that you need to buy the game of switch. So I have a switch with no game. Used my savings to buy it.

Hope you guys are fine.

thank you for letting me to vent."
Anxiety,"How can I get my mom to understand my issues, without sounding like an asshole?","My mom doesn't really understand why I panic. She gets upset when I do. She doesn't mean to, but she does. 

Everytime I try to explain what's going on in my head she goes back to the same rhetoric of ""use your coping mechanisms, talk to your therapist, stop freaking out over every little thing"" and I appreciate it, I really do. But none of it is truly helpful. 

She's been trying to push me out of my comfort zone, and if it were baby steps I would enjoy it more, but these haven't been baby steps. 

We're going to a spa tomorrow, I've gotten zero sleep, and the idea of people touching me right now has made me go into a panic attack. If I tell my mom she's gonna get upset because ""I'm doomsdaying"" over getting sick. I'm not anymore, I just don't like being close to people. It took me forever to get used to my boyfriend touching me. I hate *doctors* touching me, what makes you think I want a total stranger touching any part of me?? 

Tl;Dr I word things awfully during my anxiety attacks and it's causing a shift in my mom and I's relationship, and idk how to word stuff better. Any help?"
Anxiety,Moved to London from New York 1 month before lockdown. Feeling totally alone and really far away from the people I love...,"I moved to London in February for an indefinite job relocation. It seemed like a great opportunity when I got the job promotion, so I picked up and moved by myself to the uk.

My family lives in California, and all of my friends are in nyc. I know people are in isolation in those places too and can’t really see each other, but they can still stop by each other’s apartments and say hello through the window - or go for a distanced walk at the park to at least have some sort of interaction. As things open up, I think this is going to being harder and harder and my homesickness will get stronger.

In London things have already started to relax, and it hurts to see everyone at the park with their friends when I have no one to call at all. Right now is also an impossible time to meet new people, because people’s social circles are restricted and they are prioritizing the most important people in their lives (aka no the new girl).

I also found out this week that our office has closed down indefinitely, so I won’t be able to make friends with the colleagues I was starting to build relationships with during my first month in the office.

I am making it through one day at a time, but each day it gets more difficult. This will likely be my reality for all of 2020 and maybe beyond, depending how things go... it feels impossible and I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through.

Any guidance or ideas about how to cope would be so helpful. I just feel so alone in this situation and I can’t really relate to anyone about this strange spot I’m in..."
Anxiety,Did I have a panic attack or a stroke?,"So yesterday I had a pretty bad depressive/anxiety episode, followed by a very manic episode where I felt almost good and normal and was laughing about.

Then I went to bed and I kinda got this sudden very brief spinning sensation in my head. As I tried falling asleep I got this feeling like I can't breathe suddenly. My heartrate skyrocketed, I began sweating and suddenly I felt very different? Odd? Detached? The room felt different and everything was scary. I was scared I will die. I felt nauseous and like I will vomit. My breathing was very labored and my chest felt so tight it almost hurt.

I got up and felt like my legs are cut off. My arms felt weak and clumsy but I didn't have any trouble opening my Xanax and taking one. It was weird like I could do everything but it all felt strange at the same time, like numb and almost like I wasn't doing it. I texted my friend to comfort me and in about an hour I was calmer and fell asleep. I woke up from sleep few times with a similar feeling and it now subsides slowly. It's just this weird feeling and if I think about last night I get overwhelming panic again.

Was this a panic attack? I know none of us are doctors but I wouldn't wanna go to the ER during COVID over nothing especially since few people from the staff got infected there the other day."
Anxiety,I want to stop over analysing. I’m 14 any tips?,"How Do I Stop Over-Analysing? I’m 14

I’m 14 and I have a problem with over analysing everything. Like if someone says something in a weird way I just think about it for ages, or if someone looks at me weird I’ll think about it for long but also just be cautious of them.there has been an instance where it’s saved me I guess. I got into a taxi that my mum called for me (I had to travel alone in it to school) and the driver didn’t say anything as I got in, just stared at me for 5 seconds through the mirror and started driving. I took this as a red flag and looked around the car. At the passenger seat (the front one next to the driver) there was a pole like thing and rope... I grabbed the pole then realised it was a crowbar. He had locked the doors so I opened it with the crowbar from the inside (it was one of them old fashioned locks that open from the inside) and I just jumped out. He stopped the car immediately and got out then chased me for a while. I lost him and ran to a store where I told them and they didn’t believe me... I told my mum and she told the police but they searched for the drivers name (mr johnston) and it wasn’t registered with the cab company. I was confused af and my mum didn’t seem to believe it either (even though I had a cut on my knee from landing on  concrete after jumping out of a moving car). But anyways that’s an experience where over analysing has ‘saved’ me I guess. Any way to stop over analysing btw?"
Anxiety,Does anyone elses panic/anxiety predominantly relate to other people being ill?,"So I've noticed I am constantly petrified about the people around me being ill. For example my mum feels a bit dizzy/headachey right now and I literally feel in full panic - I convince myself it's something awful and she's going to collapse or keel over. My boyfriend had a migraine and threw up a few months ago and I was crying and shaking and couldn't cope and thought he was going to die. My sister had period pains last week and I was terrified it was something more.

If anyone is ill or feels ill I just completely panic that they're going to die, and I just can't cope.

I've also convinced myself that it's likely that everyone around me will die young. It's probably worth mentioning that my dad has been diagnosed with incurable cancer and I think this has hugely amplified my fears. The coronavirus situation isn't helping either. 

I know I need to get some therapy, I just needed to get that off my chest and see if anyone else suffers with this."
Anxiety,You are worth it,"So, I am just here to share my experience that things can get better.
I was an agoraphobic for over 10 years due to anxiety. I avoided crowds, lines of any kind, public transport ect...basically over time I avoided everything. I thought there was no way out of this and no-one would understand (most didn't), It took a long time for me realise I was as good, if not better than than those I feared. I hope you can realise this one day too."
Anxiety,Self talk in times of anxiety.,"I've noticed my anxiety gets really bad in times of isolation and negative self talk.  These last weeks I've been somewhat isolated because of social distancing.  However, I've also noticed that I've been really been engaging in a lot of negative self talk.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that I feel like I'm getting old and I really don't know where I'm going in the future.  (I'm wanting to do a career change, but I don't know where I'm going to go in the future.) and I don't have many close friends. Then my self talk takes over saying that I'm weak for still having this anxiety and there's nothing I can do to change anything.  The problem is that the feelings feel really real because my anxiety is so physical.  How can I calm myself down in the midst of this and counter my self talk?"
Anxiety,Needs to be said.,"You know what I don’t understand. You see a therapist for a year because you need Help with how to handle yourself you ADHD, PTSD , your anxiety, how to minimise the amount of anxiety attacks you have, to grow forward as a person and to have someone who you trust to talk to about anything. Then the therapist you’ve been seeing leaves that job for her own reasons.

 so for 6 months you decide you don’t want to open up to someone knew because that seems scary. But then you get to a point where you feel so low and that you need help so you give the CAFS  office a call and tell them you need help. You want help. You reach out. And they check your  files and literally say “because you’re 18 and an adult now, living with your partner and working full time you don’t reach the standards to see a therapist” 
How the fuck is that allowed. They’re supposed to be there to help you when you reach out for it. 

Child adolescent family services.

Being 18 living with my partner with a full time job doesn’t exactly make it any easier to handle myself or my anxiety or adhd or ptsd.
What does that have to do with anything. Over 85 suicides in New Zealand this year alone. And this is part of the reason. The people who gather the strength to actually identify the fact they need help and spend 2 hours holding the phone with the number on speed dial until they pull them self to together to push call. To then open up about why they want help say everything that’s happens and is happening completely stepping out of your comfort zone to then get told they can’t help you? 

Complete bullshit.

Yes I’m going through shit and yes I feel my lowest but to anyone who feels the same, I’m fucking here for you man I don’t care who you are.

I can’t say I can help you or give good advice but I can tell you that I will listen and give my opinion or I will sit down and have a coffee while you rant about your problems and then we can go for a walk and change the subject. I am there for every single one of you who feel the way I do. 

The thought that there were over 85 people in the last 6 months who felt they had no one. The thought of my own friend up there in heaven because she felt alone. The thought of myself maybe reaching that point or anyone else I care about. It kills me.
  

I am here, even when you feel you have no one. If you’ve never even spoken to me. I am here to listen to your struggles to try help and guide you to the best of my ability and potentially grow from it myself. 

No one should be sitting in their bed crying them self to sleep because they feel they aren’t good enough.

NO ONE"
Anxiety,Worried about giving coronavirus to my parents,"I know I might get a bit of judgement on this, but I saw my parents for the first time yesterday since covid lockdowns started in March. I’m extremely close to my family, and before this my boyfriend and I used to see them every weekend so it’s taken a lot of restraint not to see them for this long and had taken a toll on my mental health.

We bought a house right before lockdowns started and are moving next week, and we needed to buy a car (moving from downtown to the suburbs), so my dad came to help us negotiate since we’re first-time car buyers. Afterwards, he invited us to social distance in their backyard with some drinks, but then it started pouring rain so we had to go inside. We tried to keep our distance as much as possible and I never hugged them or anything, but at some points we were sitting quite close to them.

My dad has an autoimmune disease and my mom is fairly healthy, but both are 60 years old so at an at-risk age. Right now the government in my province is allowing groups of 5 people from 2 different households to get together, so technically what we did wasn’t “wrong” but we didn’t social distance properly. I work from home but my boyfriend works with the public, so I’m constantly worried that he’s going to bring covid home (on top of worrying about my parents contracting it). Now I know that I’m going to be paranoid for the next 14 days, calling my parents up often to ask if everyone feels ok. I’m just feeling really awful and anxious this morning that I should have been more careful, but it’s been so incredibly hard to stay away from my parents until this point. I just can’t stop crying. This was also the first time I’d seen anyone in person since March; I haven’t seen any of my friends either, even from a distance.

TLDR; I saw my parents over the weekend and we didn’t social distance very well, and now I’m afraid my boyfriend or I may be asymptotic and given covid to my parents."
Anxiety,Really struggling with anxiety attacks,"I have always suffered from really bad anxiety and depression but the last few months it’s been soooooo much worse especially since what’s going on jt the world it peaks at night and I don’t know what I can do I just want to feel normal again, I have constant anxiety and panic attacks such as tight chest (I feel like I’m having a heart attack) it’s actually awful and I’m sick of feeling like this I have extreme shakes and trouble breathing it’s almost like I forget how to breathe, I have extremely bad insomnia I have tried a few over the counter anxiety remedies but nothing has worked I am a bit apprehensive about going on anxiety meds as I have been on them in the past and it’s made gain weight like crazy and because I am slightly overweight I want to lose weight not gain it! It’s extremely hard. Can anyone recommend anything that will

I’m hopefully seeing a pysch in 2 weeks and please don’t suggest breathing exercises etc I don’t have the patients, I really can’t bare feeling like this all the time it’s fucking up my life I’m always sad and depressed and I’m sick of panic attacks just coming on out of no where I just want to feel normal again. :("
Anxiety,Concentration Meditation app to help you relax/sleep,"I created a website (see link) to help people RELAX. The website allows users to practice concentration meditation by focusing on nothing but the dot/spot. Users can change the speed, size, colour of the dot/spot and the size of the area that the dot moves in. Choose whatever is best for your focus. Then just stare at the dot, try not to blink for as long as possible and any random thoughts you have just ignore/let them pass by and go back to concentrating on the dot. I recommend doing it for around 5-10 minutes at first and then if you want try to increase the duration. I find 15 minutes is good for me. I have found this a good meditation that allows me to relax, and if I do it before bedtime I find it makes it easier for me to fall asleep. Anyway, my website is,

Anxiety,"Should I just as if I’m annoying, or would that be even more annoying?","I know this is the typical anxiety question, but I actually need to know. My friend tells me I’m annoying a lot but like not in a mean way, but the  they told me that they actually mean it but still love me. My brain somehow managed to totally blend out the “I still love you” and just focuses on the “annoying” part since then. I don’t know what it is, but I really don’t wanna annoy them, so I’d change it, but then again wouldn’t that be annoying as well? Like I know it’s not good to change because someone else said so, and I wouldn’t want that from my friends either, but I just can’t stand this feeling. So should I ask or nah?"
Anxiety,I just got prescriped a benzo for the first time. Can anyone share their experiences?,"Im on SSRIs for day-to-day anxiety. Has worked pretty well, though there are very specific situations that destroy me.

Doc gave me 5 tablets for a bit of a trial run. Instructions are to take .25mg an hour or two before I know i'll be put in a anxiety-inducing situation.

I don't see the need to take one until late next week for an event, but i'm very curious to hear about what people's experiences were taking these things for the first time.

thank you"
Anxiety,Propranolol x Grapefruit,"I take 10 mg of propranolol everyday and have for the past \~4 months.I know you cant eat or drink grapefruit on it, but I ordered some moisturiser with a grapefruit fragrance and I just used it because I couldn't see any grapefruit in the actual ingredients, but now I'm freaking out because I didn't realise the interaction can actually kill you, and I'm paranoid im gonna die just because I used some moisturiser

Anxiety,Starting to realize certain friendships are making me feel worse.,"Title says it all. Before anyone says I’m being selfish bc we are all dealing with the current social / political climate differently - this has been a year plus in the making. 
Someone I’ve treated like family and genuinely care for as an extension of my family has started to act as though I am an annoyance or an inconvenience. No one is perfect but I have reflected with my husband and cannot find where I’ve done anything blatantly annoying or disrespectful. I am realizing that it’s all been Lip Service and a friendship that serves as an ego stroke. 
I am heart broken but I cannot let this drain on me anymore. This has instigated strong thoughts of self doubt and loneliness and inadequacy. Then I spiral bc I become embarrassed that I let anyone feel any kind of way. I have an amazing partner and child so I’m ashamed that I’ve let anyone make me feel this way but I cannot help it. 
I don’t even want to put the energy into officially cutting ties but I have decided to distance myself from this friend for a while. I understand that I am not “owed” anything but I’m tired of feeling like I pour myself into all of my relationships just for people like this friend to treat me like I’m disposable."
Anxiety,Is your anxiety of phone calls and FaceTime ruining long distance friendships?,"So I graduated from college two years ago and moved to a different state where not a single one of my college friends lives.  I have group chats with some of them where we text in it pretty regularly, but I have some friends who are not.

Although I have a couple of friends who fall into this category, I have one really good friend called E, that prompted me to post this.  We were like soulmate best friends, we unfortunately met the last year of college and we were soooooo close.  Originally when I moved, she would often call me or FaceTime me and I would almost always ignore it..... I have anxiety (not like debilitating, but I’m prescribed anti anxiety meds and Xanax) but I HATE phone calls/FaceTime.  I literally can only call my family, other than that I almost never use the phone.  Even calling customer support gives me panic.

So now E has stopped trying and although we text sometimes, I feel our friendship is disappearing which I really don’t want to happen.

Does anyone have advice on what to do?  I know I should just call but for some reason that makes me literally sick to my stomach.  And this is a widespread problem, it’s making it difficult to really keep any friends that I don’t live close to.  Plus I feel bad knowing I’m being a really bad friend :(

Tl;dr My anxiety over calls and FaceTimes is ruining friendships"
Anxiety,I’m In Love,"I’m in love and have been for the past 3.5 years. Anxiety has had ahold of me for the past 10+ years. I’ve had depression since I was 10 or 11, I’m a 32F.

I’m in love and it scares me to death constantly. I’ve been dating my partner I’m in love with on and off for the past 3.5 years. On and off because I constantly burn the relationship down to the ground.

Because of genetics and my childhood depression and anxiety is a daily struggle. I started talk therapy at 18 and was put on medication. In the past couple of years I’ve done DBT and EMDR therapy. Currently I’m not in therapy and I take St. John’s Wort to try and balance out my mood.

Weekly I have overwhelming fears that my partner will cheat on me. Sometimes it’s passing suspensions, other times it’s close to panic attack levels. I vocally accuse my partner of cheating and doubt his love for me to him. I become mean and ugly and tell him I want to break up. The fight or flight comes to me.

This hurts him terribly.

I start to dissociate. I become cold and his face becomes unfamiliar to me. I make him an enemy in my mind. I look at his face and know this is the person I loved just yesterday, but today he has caused me pain and he is nearly a stranger. But he didn’t cause me pain, I inflicted emotional pain on myself.

I was married before. I gave birth to our baby and 4 months later my ex-husband never came home one night. We argued that weekend and he decided he didn’t love me anymore and immediately moved in with another woman. Leaving me with our 4 month old girl, no job, and no money. He came back around 2 months later deciding it was a big mistake. We divorced a few years later because of this and because he physically beat me a couple times.

I’m in love with an emotionally strong and intelligent man that is sweet, caring, and tender. He challenges me to be a better person, to be stronger, to not retreat or make excuses for my behavior that comes from my depression and anxiety.

I want to marry this person.

I can’t marry this person, yet, because he wants me to overcome the ugliness from the battles I cause or at the very least work harder to understand them and apologize for what I’ve done.

I don’t know what to do when that thought arises that he’ll cheat, he’ll find someone else, he doesn’t really love me. The thought I should get out now because I can’t handle a relationship, that we’d be better off separated. The thought that I’d be better off alone. These thoughts take over my brain and body, they cause me to be uncomfortable in my own skin, feelings that I’m going to die if this isn’t taken cared of immediately.

Has anyone else had to battle themselves to stay in a relationship with a partner they love and want to spend the rest of their life with, but constantly find themselves tearing away?

This is painful. I’m fruitful in all other aspects of my life. I want to get married. I don’t want to burn my relationship down to the ground. Has anyone successfully overcome this or found a way to better manage feelings such as these?"
Anxiety,Valerian root,"So this week was my first time using the capsules. I really do like them and it helps take the edge off....but for some reason it seems to take at least two hours to kick in. I know everyone’s body is different, but is this normal? Is there anything i can do or take to make it work faster?"
Anxiety,Im having a mental breakdown and no one is taking me seriously!,"They all think Im joking, they tell me that Im mean and selfish. I want to kill myself. My father even joked about lebotomizing me!"
Anxiety,Poking and picking at my anxiety triggers like a scab,"I have some specific triggers that are both internal and external, and I can very easily slip down a spiral of having a mildly triggering thought and I'll feel strangely compelled to keep seeking out exposure to the trigger, scratching that wound and triggering myself more in the process until I've ruined my day and I'm miserable and in a terrible anxiety loop.

Being on SSRIs has made these spirals much shorter and milder, but once in a while a sneaky thought will send me down that path anyway. I know it's bad for me, but I feel an urge to keep staring into the triggering abyss and I don't understand why I do this to myself. I guess it might be a type of messed up misguided habituation or an attempt to resolve the anxiety by confronting it, but time and time again I return to it as if I'm going to glean something new from scratching that same exact scab. It's like I get a sudden ""What if it's gotten worse while I haven't been looking at it"", even though it's always the same.

I know I'm not alone in being stuck in this behavioural loop and have talked to a therapist about it. It's really hard to balance not being avoidant and not pointlessly triggering myself when there's nothing new for me to learn from it.

Have you folks dealt with this, and how? Do I need to instead habituate to not reacting to the triggering thought? When the thought emerges, not following the anxious breadcrumb trail feels intolerable, almost worse than the self-triggering."
Anxiety,Anxiety when driving,"I’m 23 and still have so much anxiety about driving. It’s such a problem that it causes me to shake anytime I think about having to get behind the wheel. The thing is I can go ahead and do the driving, not too good but ok, but I have not gone out on the road with other cars. The thought alone makes me want to vomit. I need to get my DL soon and I don’t know to get over this fear . Anyone else overcome this issue??"
Anxiety,When did you know it was time to ask for help?,"I’m a male, 28. I’ve always had mild anxiety but have always been able to manage it pretty well. Late last year, I started experiencing lightheadedness, chest pains, reflux, digestive issues and fatigue. Then I found myself constantly worried about what was wrong with me, which I think made me feel even worse. I was hyper focused on how I was feeling every second. I ended up going to the ER one morning when my symptoms were at their worst. They did 2 EKGs and a chest x ray and monitored me for about 3 hours. The doctor said everything looked 100% normal and that it was most likely due to stress. This made sense to me because it was the week after Christmas (we have a big family so we were constantly on the go, visiting relatives that whole week) and my wife was also 8 months pregnant at the time, so we were about a month away from a big change in lives with our first baby. So after the visit the ER, I started feeling a little better each day. I think having all the tests done put my mind at ease and allowed me relax a little. About 3 weeks later, I felt totally normal. Not sure if it’s because the baby came so I had a ton of other stuff on my mind and couldn’t focus on how I was feeling, or what?

I went about 4 months feeling totally fine. I didn’t experience any of the symptoms I was feeling back in January. Then all of sudden out of nowhere they all came back at the end of May. This time I’m thinking it’s because I’ve had a ton of changes happen at work due to the pandemic. In the past 2 months they’ve bounced me around and I’ve had literally 5 different job titles. There’s been constant change and I haven’t been able to get into a solid routine and I believe that’s stressed me out. I’m thinking this is my body telling me I need to take it easy. But I’m also wondering if big life changes are a trigger that gives me really bad anxiety? 

Focusing on other task seem to make me feel better. Like yard work or cooking or playing guitar. But when I’m just siting there watching TV or driving to work I hyper focus on how I feel and it makes me feel worse. Exercise seems to help a lot also... but they’re only temporary fixes. This isn’t affecting my quality of life yet. But I’m worried it could in the future if it gets any worse. 

Just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this and if they’ve gotten professional help or gotten through it on their own. Thanks I’m advance!"
Anxiety,how to control the physical effects of anxiety?,"Today I am happy, after a long time.  This afternoon I am going to see some people that I have not seen for a long time, so it is normal that I feel more anxious or nervous, but damn.  I mean, mentally I feel good, I want to see them and I don't know, I really want to live today (and it is strange for me to want to ""live""). But physically I have all the symptoms of anxiety and I can't take it anymore. You know what?  I had been bad, depressed, sad for a long time (I still am but the road begins to light up) and a few days ago I began to feel ""happiness"" but I have realized that, however happy I am, I still feel that ""physical"" anxiety  and I'm fed up.  What do you do when you are happy and still feel anxiety? Because today I'm happy but I still feel dizziness, nausea, cold sweats, heat from some parts of the body, chills, even a little desire to self-harm and shortness of breath. What can I do?"

Anxiety,Anyone else have this symptom ?,"Hi guys hope you’re all okay! My symptom is that when I’m somewhere like the bath and  chest is bent a bit (it’s very rare it happens) but I get a sharp stabbing pain in my ribs / heart and I have to straighten my posture then it usually goes. It full goes after a couple minutes. Is this a muscular thing ? has anyone else experience this ? Any advice would be great ! Thank you in advance 

I must add that last year this would give me the biggest panic attack ever u his year it hasn’t bothered me only a tiny tiny bit just because I don’t know what it is ! So that’s a win ! Thank you guys"
Anxiety,I am anxious about returning back to my pre lockdown routine.,"Things that make me anxious are thinking of going back to office, constant interaction with fellow employees, friends, and hanging out with them. I have become accustomed and leant to love this slow paced lifestyle I have adopted in this lockdown, primarily because it allows me to give time to myself (and I have learnt so many new things about myself coz of that). I fear going back to that fast paced lifestyle post lockdown and losing all these things which I loved doing. Also, I fear this lockdown is turning me back into that severely introverted kid I was while growing up, who hated talking to people, and had a lot of social anxiety."
Anxiety,"Anxiety, Sweat, and Smell?","Was wondering if anyone has a similar problem. When I get stressed/anxiety I start to feel like my skin is burning. It's like a pins and needles pain in a way along with my skin feeling warm/hot. It doesn't usually last but it sort of flashes, the feeling usually emanates from my chest and moves down my arms and legs. When this happens I usually start to sweat profusely. I can then usually feel heat being removed from my body, as what sweating is suppose to do I guess. I sweat so much my pants and shirt usually become drenched in sweat. I don't smell anything but by other people's reactions and comments it must smell pretty bad when this happens. I'm sure if the anxiety is causing some sort of distress reaction and I become a skunk in a way, or if it is because of the sweat even though I pack on deodorant.

I went to visit a family member recently, I was doing fine, then I saw someone scratch them nose and that was enough to trigger an anxiety attack. I had everything happen as explained above. As soon as it did they started using their hair as a mask for their nose. So yah. 

I don't look forward to going back to work. It is just constant daily harassment. That harassment just leads to me having more anxiety and making the problem worse which just leads to more harassment, and the cycle continues.

I have hyperhidrosis so I do sweat a lot when I don't have anxiety anyways. I have taken prescriptions that are suppose to reduce sweating. They make the pins, needle, and hot feeling I get with anxiety not as intense. And I don't sweat as much when it happens, but I still get the feeling, still sweat, and obviously still smell.

Society has made it ok to make fun of people that smell, I wish the solution was as simple as simply taking a shower. I take two a day cause I sweat so much even when I'm not active while asleep. But the situation is much more complicated than that. I hate it. I'm going to miss quarantine where I don't have to deal with daily harassment.

Thanks for reading."
Anxiety,How do I make an appointment with my doctor?,I know this sounds silly but I’ve been putting off making an appointment to talk to my doctor about my mental health for over a year because I don’t know what to say to the receptionist when I call and I don’t want to sound stupid. Can someone give me some kind of script of what I should say when I call the doctor’s office? Thank you.

Anxiety,Breathing Exercises and CBT Methods that Changed my Life,"Hey guys, 

I had extreme anxiety that was debilitating and I'm now leading a life that is absolutely manageable. I have been doing breathing exercises that I found on this guy [Luke Horton's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAc9_Ug_adJvcKJhAIUqhIQ/featured). He doesn't have many subscribers or views and I don't know why because it was an absolute game changer for me. I would say start with the guided breathing exercises but he also has great videos that explain CBT and make life with anxiety much easier to understand. You can explore the channel and find out what helps you. 

He also has breathing exercises here: [https://www.headfulness.com/breathing-exercise-library-1](https://www.headfulness.com/breathing-exercise-library-1). I was reluctant to buy them but they were only 7 dollars and I'm glad I did. I mostly just bought them to support Luke because his videos have helped me so much.  

I just wanted to pass a long this tool because it has helped me so much and I know there are many people still suffering. My life is not perfect but it has improved dramatically. 

Take what works and leave the rest. 

Have a good day!"
Anxiety,My anxiety is stopping me from getting out of my house to take a walk in a park near my house. I haven't stepped out of my house for 3 days. I don't know how to get myself out of my house.,
Anxiety,Constant war in my own head,"I go through all this anytime i try to speak to anybody. I can’t make friends easily because of it and i don’t talk to my family much because of it. Everytime i talk to someone, I feel like I’m saying the wrong things. Every time I talk it feels like I’m picking the wrong dialogue in a video game. To deal with it, I usually try to limit how much I’m talking and let the other person take over the conversation but I look them in the eye and nod and smile to let them know I am engaged. But if I’m getting really overwhelmed and I start to feel like I’m bombing it I will wrap the conversation up ASAP and find any reason to walk away and go to a bathroom, my car, anywhere I can be by myself and calm down. I HATE when multiple people are trying to talk to me or get my attention or when there’s too many different things going on at once, it literally makes me feel like I’m going fucking crazy. I can only interact with others to an extent before I have to separate myself. If i don’t separate myself I’ll completely shut down and just kinda sit off in a corner by myself lost in my head, thinking about how much I want to go home and be alone. I want to go a therapist but the thought of telling a stranger all of my problems is so scary. I was in therapy when i was very young (like 8 or 9) but one day I heard my therapist telling my mom EVERYTHING and i completely lost faith in therapy. It was such a betrayal. My mother and I never had a good relationship so there was a reason I was telling my therapist things I wouldn’t tell my mom. It was so embarrassing and heartbreaking to know that this therapist who i had really grown to like and trust was lying to me every day about keeping my secrets. So after that I started lying to my therapist and being very general and standoffish in everything I’d say so she wouldn’t really have anything to tell my mom, and that’s kind of the personality I have now. I don’t tell people personal things about myself, just a very general blanket of information just enough for them to THINK they know me but not enough for them to get close to me. But yea, ever since then I’ve had quite the aversion to therapy. Recently, I’m noticing it’s becoming more and more difficult to perform daily tasks just because the thought alone of having to interact with another person is like the worst thing in the world. I let my car get down to E before going to a gas station because there’s always soo many people at the gas station and i hate when people look at me. I hate going grocery shopping for the same reasons so I’ll either let my house get empty or InstaCart whatever I can. I’m starting to think all my avoidance is not helping, in fact i think it’s making it worse, I’m so used to being by myself that I’d rather jump off a bridge than attempt to interact with others. I’m always very uncomfortable in public no matter what. The only time I can relax and be myself is when I’m alone. When I go out in public there’s like a voice in my head constantly talking telling me everything I’m doing wrong. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses because I have never told anyone my problems. I would really like to get some help I can’t keep living like this I feel like a prisoner in my own brain it’s like sometimes I can’t control my thoughts or feelings because the little mean person in my head is constantly pointing out everything I do wrong. Even if i am talking to somebody and they seem to really like me, that little voice will say something like “they definitely don’t like you, they’re pretending.” When i say something dumb the voice will say “why would you say that, now who is gonna want to be around you you sound dumb”. If i smile at someone in passing on the street to be friendly, the voice in my head will say “why are you smiling at strangers that’s weird now they probably think you’re a crazy person”. If i walk past someone in public and DONT smile, the voice in my head will say “now they think you’re a bitch, you could’ve at least smiled”. I’m sorry this is so long but I’m starting to think I’m going crazy. It’s a CONSTANT war in my head me vs myself. It’s so tiring. The only time I can truly be happy and not lost in my thoughts is when I’m drunk and a few months ago I started developing a drinking and smoking (weed) problem but I’ve stopped drinking because i figured drinking would do a lot more damage than smoking. Smoking really helps me calm down ALOT I don’t feel crazy when I smoke, it’s easier for me to articulate and think and i don’t fixate on my problems when I’m high (sorry i don’t mean to promote drug use or anything, just explaining why this is my coping method). Anyway yall have a good day/night, thanks to anyone who took the time to read. Sorry if this is all over the place, I just thought it would help for me to get my feelings out so i apologize if this isn’t very well structured. IF YOU KNOW ANY GOOD ONLINE THERAPISTS PLEASE POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I REALLY WANT TO FIX MYSELF I AM SO SCARED IM GOING TO HAVE A PSYCHOTIC BREAK OR SOMETHING AND I WOULD RATHER FACE MY FEARS OF GOING TO THERAPY THAN TO HAVE A COMPLETE MENTAL BREAK."
Anxiety,DAE feel the same? Also can anyone please help with any possible advice they have?,"I get subtle trembles and racing heart when I have some worryful thought. The thing is when I get involved (yes, found no better word to use) in literally anything - the trembles/shakes/racing all stops to a halt UNTIL I notice that I had such a problem. Then somehow more thinking about it induces it on its own. I did a meditation session focussing on a prayer and I got involved so much that it disappeared and then I being the idiot I am started thinking more about this and now it has started.

Does anybody else have the same problem and how do you cope? Any anxiety success story battling this one?

Anxiety,Anyone feel anxious when they get a call?,"So I have the weirdest anxiety hitting me whenever my phone rings or I see an incoming call. I cannot get myself to pick it. My mind doesn't even try thinking that maybe it's just a friend calling to check in or share something happy?
I always think of the worst news that could possibly be delivered and I can't pick it. Simultaneously I also feel the urge to immediately call and ask if everything was okay but it's such a conflict in my head. Most times I text them much later saying I wasn't around my phone and ask them what's up. Idk how to deal with this. Phone calls are just overwhelming."

Anxiety,Really odd things i obsess over,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with anxiety over a year ago, and since then i started noticing the weird thoughts i have. Today something happened that made me realise how weird i am. 

Basically, i have a bestfriend, lets call her Angel, and Angel goes to a university in a different city. When I posted a picture with Angel on my Instagram story, a few people from my university followed her as they know we are bestfriends, and for some reason this bothered me. And not in the way you may assume, but for a very odd reason. I started thinking ""what if people at my university goes on Angel's instagram profile and see that she is followed by other people at our university and they assume she goes to my university, so they think wow her bestfriend is someone she met in university she has no friends outside uni and she has no life

I know its so dumb and weird but seriously i can't stop overthinking it and all i want is to just stop caring about things :( does anyone know how to get rid of these annoying thoughts? These are the kinds of things i suffer with everyday"

Anxiety,How do I stop being anxious?,"My first relationship was very one sided. I always showed the proper about of affection and she hardly ever showed any. She would get mad if I ever shared my feeling and she would start an argument everytime I would do so. Then she said she was crying one night and when I asked about it she said she wasn’t crying and I didn’t press the issue so she said she thought she could hide her feelings and not bother me. She then confided in all of my friends and made herself look like the victim and me the bad guy. After she broke up with me she led me on for a month making me think she wanted to get back together. Even going as far as to kiss me and say she wanted me back. My very first relationship left me with no friends and I get really anxious whenever I see her on social media and stuff or I think about her with another person. It has calmed down but I recently saw a picture of her with a friend who played a big role in rumors, and stuff being spread around, and our breakup in general. I got really anxious because I knew they were going out with my other “ex-friends” and I don’t know what to do to not be anxious. I’ve tried meditation and going on walk. Everytime I try to distract myself with something else I get more anxious and I stop doing whatever it was. It’s really hurting my ability to interact with other people. After the rumors getting around everyone thinks Im a dick. And I find myself getting angrier at little things. I’ve even got a girl who wants to be with me but I don’t think it’s fair to be with her and still get anxious over my ex. I need help

tl;dr I need help to stop being anxious over my ex."

Anxiety,I don't know if I have anxiety,"I'm scared to do anything. I can't even leave my room without feeling uncomfortable. I love it when my mum's home, however rare, but I never say anything at the table or look at anyone because I'm scared they'll judge me.

The only place I feel remotely comfortable is in my room with the door closed and the lights off, but now it's becoming a prison. 

I wish I could go outside like everyone else without being scared of being judged.

I don't know if this is anxiety, but I don't what else it could be. If it's not I'm sorry, I'm just find myself slowly giving up on more and more things as the days go by..."
Anxiety,Awkward encounters when bumping into people you know unexpectedly,"I’m sure this is a common occurrence for people who suffer from social anxiety but whenever I bump into people, even people that I have known for years and should have plenty to talk about with, I find myself being very awkward, not knowing what to say and struggling to keep the conversation going. Then later I’ll always cringe when I look back on what happened earlier."
Anxiety,Can anxiety and panic attacks have extreme physical symptoms?,"Hello there. I am 18f and have been diagnosed with episodes of panic attacks for 8 months now. My parents do no believe in ""mental health problems"" or them needing to be treated so I can't go to a therapist as of now. 

The problem with me is that the symptoms I feel are too physical for me to sideline them as panic attacks. The first time I went to ER was because i had severe trouble breathing, my chest was thumping as if i was scared as shit as if i was having a heart attack. It had happened before also but i tried ignoring it. I didn't imagine having mental health problems since i have a fairly normal life. The hospital discharged me after running couple of tests on my heart saying I am physically fine so it has to be panic attacks. So they recommended seeing a therapist which my father obviously ignored completely. 

My physical symptoms haven't gone away even after the meds I was given. I can't ask my parents to take me to doctor again as I feel like a burden when i go.

My physical symptoms appear way too randomly even when am feeling peaceful and am not stressed like I have trouble breathing for some time then suddenly my heart starts beating like anything then suddenly everything goes away then it all comes back together and i feel like I'm going to die. I really don't know if its panic attacks or something is wrong with my heart or lungs.

Has anyone else experienced such physical symtoms? Please help."
Anxiety,Debilitating “imposter syndrome” and intense anxiety over my job/career...need help changing my mindset please.,"I apologize in advance if this is long! I have been dealing with this for over 9 months and it’s sending me into a depression and just overall ruining my day to day life. Any advice or resources to help would be fantastic (with covid, I’m not in a position to be able to see a therapist right now although I should have months ago...)!

I’m relatively new in my career (2 years) and I feel an overwhelming amount of daily pressure in my job to where it’s ruining my relationships—my job has become the only thing I tie my worth to, I’m constantly working in order to prove my worth to my managers/team and I think about work constantly on the weekend. Not just “oh I need to do this on Monday” but literally dread-filled anxious thoughts of “this is a mess, I messed this up, I’m going to get fired if I screw this up.” I hardly spend time with my husband and I’m always in a bad mood and snap at him all the time because I’m stressed and anxious nearly 24/7 and constantly thinking about work or working.

The messed up part is that I’ve never received negative feedback from my managers—in fact, it’s always the opposite: I’m doing an amazing job, etc etc. but this makes me feel WORSE and full of even more pressure, like I have to keep it up and stick to these high expectations and I can’t let anyone down. I’m afraid with any slip up or mistake, they’ll “find me out” and fire me. I know this is 100% pressure I’m putting on myself, but I don’t know how to stop. In theory, I actually do enjoy what I do, but I dread every single Monday. After the work day is over, I’m constantly checking my emails and responding to people until late when I go to bed—I feel like I can’t leave anyone waiting or they’ll complain that I’m unresponsive/not working hard enough. I only get paid hourly with no OT, so I’m doing all of this unpaid. But I feel like the unspoken expectation is that I have to do this in order to keep everyone happy (my boss has literally said before that I’ll succeed in this field if I just keep everyone happy).

I think there’s a lot about my work environment that is toxic, but because I’m new to the field, I feel like this is the best I’ll get and I’m worried if I find another job, I either won’t get paid as much (I already feel I’m overpaid) or the environment is even worse. I truly feel so stuck. I simultaneously am terrified of being fired/laid off, but also hope that it does happen so that I can breathe again.

How can I change my mindset to stop being obsessed with work and tying my self-worth to my career/money? I can’t live like this."
Anxiety,Guys I have a question.Is it possible to have anxiety and suffer physical symptoms without even realising you have it?,
Anxiety,Severe Caffeine Sensitivity - Anxiety attack yesterday,"As I get older I have noticed my sensitivity to caffeine has increased. It's very frustrating as everyone around me downs their coffee and goes back for a second round, or drinks their energy drink with no problem. Yet I go into full panic mode if I go beyond my (very small) threshold. 

I've been managing it well for several months drinking matcha and limiting caffeine. However, I decided to drink some coffee yesterday AM, just because - it was great and I wanted it! In the afternoon I was working an event and a friend brought some organic Yerba Matte energy drinks for everyone (160mg caffeine). Worst mistake... 

Within an hour I felt that familiar uneasiness (it's the worst, and I know you guys know!). Heart racing, anxiety, dread and worry something terrible is going to happen. Moreover, I started to get pain between my shoulder blades and freaking out because I started googling that and seeing awful things like cancer, heart attack, etc... which kicked my anxiety into high gear. I walked away and felt light-headed and low energy. Just bad. 

Came back and friend gave me food, I realized I had barely anything to eat and I was in the sun all day.  I started to feel better after eating and the anxiety attack and symptoms dissolved within that following hour. 

HOW do I stop this from happening? Obviously I may be sensitive to caffeine and it is a trigger but... it's just not fair! I don't want to feel like something terrible is going to happen to me if I decide to have an energy drink."
Anxiety,Panic attacks in the early morning. Every morning.,"I'm diagnosed with GAD. Have had it for probably seven years, but being treated for it with medication for the last three. It's been pretty under control until recently it's come back with a vengeance after my wife and I purchased our first house.

 Every morning I have a panic attack and anxiety all day for various nonsensical reasons. It's made the whole house ownership experience extremely depressing and stressful. My wife wishes we never bought it because now I'm a mess again and dont feel like doing anything but laying down.  It sucks and I just needed to vent."
Anxiety,Do you feel more anxiety when you’re put “on the spot”?,Example is when someone asks you a question that you weren’t prepared for and then you feel like your head is scattering looking for answers and you also feel you’re being rushed to come up with an answer which heightens you’re anxiety.
Anxiety,Health anxiety,"Trigger warning: talks on disordered eating habits and fertility issues.

Hi guys. To get straight to the point, I’m having health anxiety pertaining to possible fertility issues.

I’ve had irregular periods since menarche which I think are caused by disordered eating habits. It all started when I was a teenager, probably around 13, when I developed an unhealthy relationship with food. I would restrict my calories. Whenever I ate, I’d make sure to purge. If not, I’ll exercise the heck out of myself. This made my period very wonky.

I’m 22 now, with irregular periods and I’m afraid I can’t have babies. Yeah this may seem too far-fetched of a problem to think of but I’m genuinely scared. The only reason I have to live is that I want to build a family of my own and make my parents happy. Sad to say that if I’m unable to do these things I’m better off dead. I’m chronically depressed so really, there’s nothing much to lose.

My appointment with the gynae is on the 11th. As the day comes closer I get even more anxious. I’m afraid they’re gonna tell me I did this to myself. In fact, I’m pretty sure I did. I’m afraid I’m gonna have another breakdown because of this. I’m afraid I can’t forgive myself. I failed my own body."

Anxiety,Other exercise than running to relieve anxiety?,"Running significantly relieves my anxiety. I have recently picked it back up after a couple of years, and the change in my mood after a 30 minute run is remarkable.

However, as I am still a beginner, running everyday is not recommended because of the strain on my joints and muscles. I can really tell the difference between a non running day and a running day. For those of you who run, or do other workouts, and notice a similar difference in their mental wellbeing; which other type of exercise really helps you?

Please let me know if I’ve used the right flair, I’m new to this sub. Was doubting between this one and Health, but I could of course also be wrong altogether."
Anxiety,Trigger : I have very weird phobia,"So 2 years ago I became severely depressed ( my aunt was diagnosed with  terminal illness) since then I deal with terrible  phobia : tapephobia\_ a fear of being buried alive

I have  read many urban legends about people  burying alive .I know in most cases they are made up by journalists but still ...

how can  I convince my mind that I am not  logical ?  any advice would be appreciated"
Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"Hi guys. I haven’t been diagnosed with a proper anxiety disorder but pretty sure I’ve had one for a few years now. 

Over the past couple of months since lockdown I’ve been doing like surprisingly okay with my anxiety. Then yesterday, I didn’t have any lunch, and I started feeling really tired, out of it, dizzy etc. I had dinner and felt a bit better afterwards, but still like my brain was slowed down, my speech was slow, all that stuff. Then today, I woke up feeling fine, then as the day went on got a bit tired, and a few hours ago the same weird tiredness/dizzy feeling came over me (even though I ate lunch today). Could this be anxiety? Naturally, I’m panicking that it’s coronavirus! Someone please quell my fears ☹️"
Anxiety,I hate this,Haven’t had any anxiety attacks in a week and a half or so and now I’ve had about 15 since I woke up this morning loud noises and sounds are triggering me into full blown attacks rapid heart beats and chest pains and I hate it so much I just wanna relax 😩
Anxiety,My day so far,"I woke up suddenly this morning to the sound of my relaxing playlist I left on to sleep to last night. I don’t really know why it scared me, but needless to say I didn’t go back to sleep. 

I haven’t been amazing the past few days as my anxiety has been at an all time high. I get anxiety doing the simplest tasks: showering, eating, sleeping. I really didn’t have the motivation to shower and change my bedsheets today. After a few hours, I eventually changed my bedsheets and hopped in the shower. 

Normally when I shower these days, I put on my shampoo and conditioner before getting into the shower. When I feel really anxious, I wash my body before the shower too. This is because I get really nervous that I may pass out in the shower so it limits the time I’m in there. Today, however, I turned the bathroom lights off, had one candle lit and played R&amp;B songs whilst I showered properly. It sounds cheesy but it was really nice. 

Quite a while after getting out I started to have my usual nerves. I’m going to have an early night tonight and call my doctor tomorrow to ask if it’s possible to be put on anxiety medication again."
Anxiety,"I get so anxious when it comes to social interactions and activities, how do I over come this?","I'm 19 and a dude.

Anyways, I always get really anxious or scared when it comes to doing things social, atleast before I start. Like if my friends ask if I want to hang, I dont know why but I'll get really anxious about it even if I know I'll have fun and when I do manage to go out with them I still feel a tiny bit of anxiety but it isnt really noticeable if at all. 

Also, just doing things like going to the store to get something for my mom is nerve racking for me and I will refuse to go sometimes. I dont think my mom understands my problem as well as I would like, tbf I mostly keep all my problems to me self anyways, so she gets really mad/upset when I refuse.

Its especially worse when I'm trying to talk to people I dont know or maybe trying to ask someone hang. Like whever there is a girl that strikes my interest I'll start panicking and my heart will race and I will run away and avoid her... like with my high school crush I was going crazy over her yet everytime I tried to interact with her I for the life of me couldnt and when I managed too, like 2 or 3 times total out of the 4 years, I was soooo akward and I could tell she was getting uneasy. Now, I managed to talk to this other girl and she literally said that we should hang out soon I got anxious and blew it by saying I dont know when we could cuz I work these days, and now everytime i try to text her back asking if she wants to hang my heart will literally start pounding so hard i can feel it throughout my entire body and I get dizzy and just sort of freak out even though I know she wants to...

So, how do I stop doing this. I mean I know I will have fun if I go out and I know it wont be that bad but before it actually happens and the sheer thought of it makes me anxious about it..."

I also believe when I go outside I sometimes feel this way but if I am sitting down I'm ok.. I don't know to be honest I'm also having appetite problems like I am eating normal meals each day but I'm not hungry at all it's like I'm forcing this on myself..

Anxiety,I have a question for y’all about hangover anxiety,"So I drank a lot yesterday and I, unsurprisingly, have had hangover anxiety hit me like a ton of bricks this afternoon. I was wondering if any of you also experienced this (I’m sure you have) and what you do to help pass the time and keep yourself calm in the interim? So far I’ve eaten pretty healthy, gotten myself ready and am now laying in bed trying to keep my heart rate low. I’m also drinking a ton of water to try to help flush it out (I don’t know if this helps at all). Thanks in advance everyone."
Anxiety,DAE feel scared in a car (as a passenger)?,"hi, so this is kind of new to me, its been happening recently. before the lockdown (in my country), i was fine being in a car, maybe because i rode in it everyday going to school. but now after \~3 months of not leaving my  house (my parent go out, im a teen), i suddenly feel very anxious being in a car, mainly because i feel like im going to get in a car crash.  (i started going out starting last week.)"
Anxiety,Tinder and the like a complete hell for anyone else?,"Sign up (for the 500th time), get a few matches, get excited about a couple of them, get reminded that you're actually going to have to go on a date with them, back off, delete the app, feel massive relief and retreat back into comfort.

It's have to be in person for me, I think!"
Anxiety,Why does my mind do this?,"Everytime I look at something I know that happened my mind won't accept it and make these irrational conclusions, it would come up with answers that don't even make sense, I know deep down that it was ME who did it, it wasn't some random guy, it's myself, but my mind won't fucking accept that and it's ruining my entire summer. 

I hate overthinking like this, I always have to look for something that's bad and could ruin my day and it DOES, I can't get my mind off of it.

I know deep deep down that all of the scenarios my mind make up are not true, but it still keeps being a bitch and dives in head first into thesw ""what-if"" scenarios making my situation even worse than it has to be, and I know that I'll never escape.

Why am I like this? How do I make it stop?"
Anxiety,Is there a daily thread?,Yeah no joke imma newbie here but can someone post a link so i can just do that
Anxiety,Palo santo causes panic attack?,"Hey guys, im getting straight to the point and hope this is ok. So a few days ago I purchased some palo santo (for those who dont know and too lazy to google, i think it means ""holy wood"" and is used as kind of incense sticks. Its very aromatic smell shall help lower stress level and also avoid anciety, often used as support for meditation and stuff. Additional to my medical therapy, i thought this might help a little, at least I would benefit from the placebo effect.
So in a good mood evening, which was far away from big anxiety, I was very relaxed and tried to get some work done on my computer. Right a few minutes before I opened a window a bit and lit a stick just for about 10 seconds, so the ember would release just enough smoke to get sensed. All was fine, I liked that sweet smell, but about 15 minutes later, panic grew bigger so that I had a very strong panic attack, followed by nausea. I went out to get a breath of fresh air and as this didnt help I had to take my emergency drops. An hour later, I was almost okay once again. I took me almost two days to get rid of the anxiety the panic attack left behind in my chest. So almost a week later, another day that was pretty ok, no signs of any negativity. I wanted to listen to some music and thought it would be a good Idea to light up some palo santo in my living room. It was just a few seconds of smoke and the sweet smell filled my apartment. Not even 10 minutes later, boom, the nice music turned to aching noise and had a heavy panic attack once again, not being able to breathe, everything going round like in a horror caroussel. And then it hit me. Could it be the palo santo that causes it? A day later I started researching and honestly, everything I found in the internet was telling about positive effects on anxiety. I havent had such heavy panic attacks for months and now I got two just in a week. I am very certain that it was caused by that wood, bit couldnt find any report, that seems to confirm my assumption. 
Sorry for the long text in non native english, but now my question. Does anyone have experience with this ""holy"" sticks? I would be happy to get some feedback!"

Anxiety,How to deal with performance anxiety?,"I have two upcoming TTRPG campaigns. One is a VtM Chronicle I'm running, another is a D&amp;D game I've been dreaming of running for 2 years. Despite this I'm not excited. I feel like I'm going to mess up, or I'll make mistakes, or I won't be able to come up with content for my players. Often times thoughts like these become a self fulfilling prophecy for me, and thinking I'll fail makes me mess up somewhere, ruining things I try to do.

Any advice for dealing with these thoughts? Not like ""You just gotta believe"" or something. How do I beat these thoughts so I can do what I enjoy?"
Anxiety,How to deal with severe anxiety over Ex?,"So long story short me and my gf were together for about 3 years. We started fighting every day to the point where we decided to go our separate ways. Moving on has been particularly difficult because I am forced to see my ex partying on friends snapchat stories every weekend. 

I was in a wreck a few months ago so I don’t have a vehicle so I feel so isolated on the weekends stuck at home while all i see is parties and friends having the time of their lives. It’s literally torture just laying in bed thinking what my ex is doing if she’s meeting someone new, if she’s dancing on someone, If she’s gonna hook up with someone, etc. 

I know she’s free to do whatever she likes but how do I deal with the horrible anxiety I get from these thoughts? I get tremors, I lose my appetite, I start shaking, It consumes my thoughts. I literally despise the weekends due to this reason :/

Someone help"
Anxiety,how the fuck do you get a job when you have social anxiety and never worked before?,"
yeah how? i have nothing to go on. i have had anxiety for so long and depression. but the depression has gotten so much better, now im just depressed cuz i dont have a job. Im 29 years old, never had a longtime job, and I have social anxiety. im getting better but im scared of failure or be laughed at"
Anxiety,Im scared of GIRLS.,"Sorry for my english first of all.
Literally im scared of girls, the more atracted im to a girl the more scared im. If my crush approaches me and ask me something like how are u doing im completely shitting myself and responding in a really boring and arogant way. And thats why most of my crushes hate me, cuz i seem to be really fucking arogant but im fucking scared cuz im a pussy.
Even if its a girl that i dont care about, i will still be scared for some reason. Idk if its from a past trauma, when i was in 3rd grade i was pretty good at talking to girls, but now as a 18 yrs old that never had a gf im a fcking pussy. Idk what to do man."
Anxiety,Does anyone else throw up when they struggle to breathe?,"I don’t know if this is just some weird thing that happens to me, but when I get anxious, my chest tightens up and I can’t breathe and that causes me to start dry heaving. I eventually throw up and feel better but I’d rather not deal with this. Am I alone or does this happen to anyone else?"
Anxiety,Panic attacks at night,"For the past week or so I have been waking up around 3 or 4 in the morning and experiencing what I think is a panic attack. I have a huge pressure in my chest and my stomach feels as thought there are bricks in it and my arms and legs are almost numb. My whole body is extremely tense and rigid and it lasts for an hour sometimes. My thoughts will not stop and the only way it really goes away is that I eventually exhaust myself and fall back asleep. Usually I use my phone and social media as a distraction but that hasn’t been working anymore. 

I have anxiety throughout my daily life but these spikes of it only seem to happen at night. I have been trying to venture out a little more from a strict quarantine to hang out with friends family since my state is extremely low on cases (Oklahoma) and I feel that is has been so damaging to me to have been isolated for so long. I have a weird situation at home though where I live with my father and grandmother and the intense feelings of guilt and regret that are apart of these attacks tend to revolve around the fact that I am putting them at risk. I also will be graduation nursing school in December and the anxiety I feel about that also is present during these attacks. There are a lot of other factors in my life that come into the attacks also. 

I don’t really know how to stop these from happening or how to control it. I can usually shift my thoughts and use distractions to try to curb the feelings but they are so intense now that I can’t even move have the time when it’s happening. Is there any advice anyone can give me to try to get control over this?"
Anxiety,Unfulfillment,Does anyone else ever get extremely anxious when thinking about all the things they want to do with their life and worrying they'll never feel fulfilled?
Anxiety,What are your *clinical* Xanax (Alprozolam) experiences?,"I (19F) have had panic/anxiety disorder since I was very young. I was on Lexapro (escitalopram) at 15, but didn’t like it much and stopped. I can control my attacks pretty well, so I don’t feel like being on a daily medication is necessary. However, it’s been getting slightly harder to control panic attacks sometimes and I’ve been looking into the possibility of a Xanax script. But I want the opinions and experiences of people who have used it for the clinical purpose and how it makes you feel/how it helps. Thanks!!"
Anxiety,Relationship,"So during this qurantine time I have been talking to this one girl,which I find very attractive. We have been talking almost everyday at late hours. We were at the same party few weeks back and we kissed,I know that she wants me to call her out on datw(she actually said that to few of my friends) but the problem is that I am scared of relationship. Why? Because I find myself really boring,dull person and not good at socialzing. I am scared that she will find me very boring if we get into relationship,I am scared of meeting her family and friends because everyone will think why are you with this weirdo. Do you guys have any tips?"

Anxiety,Experiences with Silexan?,"Has anyone had experience with Silexan/CalmAid? (clinically standardized lavender oil) I have decided on this anxiolytic to help me with my anxiety disorder (agoraphobia), I could have asked my psychiatrist for benzodiazepines but I have had a history of drug abuse. I have read good comments and I have faith in this. Could someone who has used it tell me about their experience in relieving anxiety and the subjective effects it will have when taking it?"
Anxiety,I can't deal with the fact that I have to go back to my daily routine tomorrow.,After one week off I need to start to work and study tomorrow and I'm so overwhelmed by the thought of it. My mental health has really gone downhill the last few weeks and I can't seem to get out of it. The fear of never achieving my goals is really putting me down.
Anxiety,Looking for advice.,"Whenever I make a plan to get something done and it gets interrupted or altered by someone else, it sends my anxiety through the roof. Today, I planned on taking my so to the park for a little father-son time in the woods. When I was about 5 minutes away from leaving, my wife gave me 2 hours worth the house chores to do before I left. Immediately my anxiety shot up. But it was my turn to do the chores so I sucked it up and got it done. When I was again about 5 minutes away, she told me she needed help with some things before I left. Another hour later, I am ready to go out the door and she tells me to wait, her mother is coming over and they are both going to come with us. My wife wouldn't take a step into the woods if her life deepened on it, neither will her mother. We are going to the park to sit on a bench for an hour and go home. In order for my anxiety to go down, I need to walk, and spend time in nature. It's the only guaranteed way for me to calm down. It's been another hour and her mother hadn't even left her house yet. 

I hate feeling like this and I just want to be able to deal with a change in plans and have a good day with family. 

Any advice to get out of my head and just have a good time?"

Anxiety,Prozac withdrawal,"With the pandemic putting a lot of pressure on healthcare workers, I haven't been able to get some of my medications in time. Today marks the second week I've been without Prozac/Fluoxitine, and I've been feeling a weird ""fading away"" feeling. Like, if I don't pay attention to what I'm doing and my surroundings, I feel like I'm fading out of reality. There's even a sort of soft ringing in my head when it happens. I can't find anything on the internet that says anything about this, but could this be a symptom of withdrawal? Sorry if this is a bit disorganized. Typing is getting difficult.

Before you all panic, please know that I'll be able to get my medication tomorrow if not the day after."

Anxiety,Intimidated,I just got a new job and i has to go in to drop off some paperwork today and the people that I’m gonna be working with intimidate me. I’m against racism but when I’m there they all stare at me. I get it partially because I’m the new one but I also feel like it’s because I’m white. The managers there are white but i don’t have any coworkers who I feel like I can start a friendship with because they all are in their group already. Everyone I saw in there today were in their 20’s and were all men. I’m 18 and a girl and white and I’m super scared. I took melatonin to sleep cuz I have to go in at 6am today for my first shift but I woke up at 2 and can’t sleep cuz of my anxiety. No one else is awake right now and I’m trying to calm down but man it’s just hard.
Anxiety,Stuck in a loop,"I've never been diagnosed with anxiety, and I don't know if I even have it, I just don't know where else to put this. 

I start thinking about something normal, like today I was thinking about when I'd start work up again (I teach kids to swim), but I starting thinking about every little thing that could go wrong, even though it is something I do everyday. I don't know why it happens, but it gets to the point of all I can think about it how terrified I am of it. Today I couldn't stop thinking what happens if I get coughed on? Will I get sick? When If a kid slips and breaks a bone? What if one of the parents starts screaming at me? What if a kid drowns? What will I do? What if I just freeze up?

It got to the point that I started thinking of suicide. It can't be healthy, but I have no idea how to deal with it. I am near tears for hours at a time.

Please help."
Anxiety,Anxiety over returning to work,"Hi everyone. I hope you’re all staying healthy and calm! I was laid off at the end of March from my hotel job and have been in quarantine with my fiancé since. It took about a Month to adjust to a routine but I’ve actually started doing great! I got my eating on track, I’ve taken up yoga and roller skating and we’ve finally gotten some movies off our “must see” list. But today it finally happened, I got the phone call that I can return to work. At first I asked if I could return towards the end of June which my boss was fully supportive of (my fiancé is immunocompromised so I was worried of endangering him). Until my boss informed me that if I turn down the work right now I’ll have to report it to unemployment and potentially lose my benefits. Can’t have that, gotta pay bills. SO I agreed to go back. Since that call I’ve been so anxious. I just feel dread and panic sitting on my shoulders. I JUST got adjusted to this routine and now I have to go right back into work and try to navigate. I know many are doing it right now and so any tips from those of you working with the public right now would be really encouraging. I just feel anxious that nothing will ever be the same and I’ll never have time like this ever again. Its been nice to actually have time to focus on my hobbies and interests and spend time with my loved one. I dont know. I know I should be grateful, most people DONT have the luxury of returning to work. I’m trying to stick with the gratitude and let the rest melt away. Stay sane loves!"
Anxiety,Feel like my anxiety is not as good as other people's anxiety,"Like many, I've been especially anxious since the lockdown started in my city. I started following a couple of anxiety related pages on Instagram. Every post that I see makes me feel like there are people out there who have real/ actual/ significant anxiety. I haven't had a panic attack in months and my anxiety is so lame or superficial when compared to what some people are going through.

Not even my anxiety is tier 1, you know?

Anybody else feel this way?"
Anxiety,Goodnight Punpun and sad media," 

I am a 32M,who suffers from severe anxiety,OCD and mild depression and as a result lead a very dysfunctional,sheltered life.I used to believe that sad,painful works of fiction could work therapeutically for people with mental health problems but after reading this manga series I don't know anymore...That sense of resignation,the reminder of how chaotic and messed up life can be was something I currently didn't need in my life and I almost regret reading it.I know it's just fiction but I feel burdened with the weight of witnessing everything that unfolded in the lives of these characters,which is of course the point and aim of this story but was in worth it?I'm in more pain right now than I already was before reading it and in the verge of crying just by writing this.

I'm sorry if there is no real point in my post,I just needed to vent a little,maybe even talk about how sad media affect us.I really hope everyone who posts or lurks here can find happiness and hold on to it as long as possible."

Anxiety,I Posted this in R/HealthAnxiety but couldn't get anyone to give some advice. I'm losing sleep over this and don't know what my next step should be.,"I hope it isn't against the rules to post this here. 


I'm not really sure how to start this other then that I could really use some advice or some help. About 3 months ago I woke up in the middle of night shaking. The kind of shaking you get when your stomach hurts, or you're About to throw up. But my stomach wasn't hurting, nor was a I cold. It scared me and I was convinced I had some type of illness and this was just the start of it. Over time I just forgot about it really and moved on convinced that I was okay and have been fine ever since. Then 3 days ago I woke up in the middle of the night with my palms drenched in sweat, and them being a bit cool and clammy. I've been known to hyperventilate in my sleep it's a reoccurring habit when I panic even while I'm awake and thought to myself that this is just a side effect but I've been doing this for years and have never had this happen. I also noticed my veins were receding and the color under my nails went pale white as they do when something is severely wrong with your liver and or heart with that came this weird feeling like I knew in my head that something's not right with my body and I'm unsure of what it is. But because of this I've been getting little sleep as I'm a bit afraid to fall asleep. When I do, I usually wake up every 2-3 hours panicking. The one main thing I noticed from this is that when I yawn, or take a deep and even laugh the lower part of my abdomen feels tight or full and I'm unsure of what that is or if it's just a side effect of anxiety. Any help is very much appreciated as im unsure of whether to go to the ER if it worsens or is persistent.


Edit: I have been working a ton of 3rd shifts but I usually end up sleeping 8-9 hours after working those 3rd shifts"

Anxiety,How do I talk to my family about my need for counseling?,"Hi! New to the sub. Hope this isnt like a over asked question, but I'm really at a loss.

I've always had a lot of anxiety and self esteem issues, and its sucked, but for the most part life has been busy enough to keep me distracted from impending doom and self destruction. I mainly have social anxiety, and believe that everyone secretly hates me, and that I'm not worth the effort. 

Quarantine has destroyed all my efforts at bettering myself. Because of school, I've been forced out there around people and friends, forced to face my constant fears and anxieties. But now in quarantine, all my progress towards being a better me has disappeared. It's been like 50 days at this point, and it's really destroying me mentally. 

I feel like I need to see someone. I have no idea how any of this works, as I've been hiding how bad it is, and have never had a counselor or therapy before. How do I introduce my family to the idea? It's scary to think about talking about just how bad it is on me right now, I dont want to seem so weak and vulnerable... yet I fear how bad I'll be at the end of this. 

Tldr: Anxiety, self hate. How do I talk to my family about a need for counseling?

Thanks for reading!"
Anxiety,I feel like vomiting every time I feel excitement,"I’m a 15 yr old guy and I’ve suffered from really bad anxiety for the last couple of years. Every time I want to meet up with a friend, I get excited of course, and then that leads to a stomach ache. As time passes my stomach ache gets worse to the point where I feel dizzy and ready to vomit, which has actually happened once before while going to a friends house. Luckily her and her mom were completely understanding of my anxiety and didn’t have a problem with me coming over again sometime. Today I’m going to be meeting up with the same friend to go on a little walk, and as you may have guessed, I’m starting to have this anxious feeling again. The thing I fear most is vomiting, that’s it, and I really do want to see my friend and hang out with her more, but it’s kinda hard when every single time you do something that gets you excited, you start feeling sick to your stomach. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated."

Anxiety,Guilt Over a Mistake,"Just looking for some support to maybe lessen the guilt and anxiety after making a mistake at work. I worked with corporate to have a member of upper management fired for stealing - this is not what makes me feel guilty, she was stealing a tom of money and trying to make me an accomplice. The official statement was that she chose to not return to work and stay home with her family (she just had a baby). The rumor was already gloating around since last year, and word got around about what happened. One of my coworkers got a little gossipy and gave away more information than he should have. My guilt and anxiety comes in here. When approached by people I didn't deny the rumors and even agreed with some of the statements. Later, corporate told me our location is the source of the rumor and if they find out who it was they'll be fired. I know realistically they likely won't fire anyone, people had already suspected it and there were some things I couldn't avoid, like another manager seeing me pack of the offending manager's office before she was let go. But I can't stop feeling incredibly guilty and sick over the part I played in the gossip and absolutely terrified about losing my job. I'm the sole provider for my family. I know I shouldn't have even engaged in the conversation and I'm dying inside. I've always had anxiety but at this point I spend all day on the verge of tears and am physically sick. I asked my now immediate supervisor for guidance and she never responded to me which is making me even more anxious that they're planning on letting me go.

Sorry this is so long, I just need some help/advice."
Anxiety,Meditation,"I was a very anxious person. I couldn't even go into public transport. After many years struggling with anxiety I started meditating. Since day 1 I feel different and after 3 months the anxiety has completely vanished.

No drugs needed only meditating for 30 minutes a day that's all you need."
Anxiety,Did an online coding challenge but after submitting I realised it could have gone better,"As per the title I was really pleased initially with what I submitted to this online test.

It's for a job that I really want at a decent company.

I was under a lot of time pressure and completed the tasks with about 15 minutes to remain.

There is no way to go back and review and revise my answers now.

It's really winding me up as I know I could have given a low efficient answer now.

Is it worth me contacting the recruiter and outlining what I could have done better?

Should I just hope I get through to the next round and then discuss my improvements with the company?

I strongly believe I've done enough but it's just not optimal. I think I'm judging myself unfairly and it will be enough to know what could have been done better and take that knowledge into three next round.

What do you think I should do?"

Anxiety,My anxiety is becoming harder to manage. How do you deal with it?,"How do you deal with your anxiety when you know for a fact your fine but cant except evidence? I've always had a bit of anxiety but it was manageable I would show myself evidence that there was nothing to worry about and my anxiety would go away until it found something else to be worried about and I would keep repeating that cycle. However recently this has stopped working, I get worried about something I show myself hard core proof that there's nothing to worry about and almost instantly my anxiety pops up and I have to check again and no matter how many times I check and no matter how strong the evidence is I just cant seem to accept it."

Anxiety,I know exactly what I need but my anxiety is holding me back,"I started teaching myself guitar just over a year ago and I’m obsessed with it. My whole life I’ve wanted to do something a bit more creative for a living and once I actually got into music I realised that it was the thing for me. I love the idea of playing for people and writing music. I love creating! The only thing is that I get extreme anxiety attacks during and after showing someone a riff I came up with.
Yesterday my music teacher wanted an example of a rock riff to show the class so I volunteered. My hands were shaking and my mind went completely blank. I had an attack that lasted for an hour and the rest of the day I was exhausted and I felt like an idiot. I’m finished school next year and this is the only thing that sticks out as something I would really love to do but my own body is working against me. 

Are there any weirder techniques you use that have helped with staying calm in the moment anxiety hits? I feel as though I’ve tried everything and nothing’s worked so far. 

Thank you so much for reading! I hope you all have a great day :)"

Anxiety,How to get over driving anxiety,"Hey, guys! I’m a 22 year old autistic male who struggles with anxiety and depression. I also don’t have my license yet, but I do have my permit. My problem is that when the roads get busy, I get anxious and I feel like it’s too much to handle. I can drive to work early in the morning when it’s less busy with no issue, but I get scared driving back because of how busy it is. Is there a way to remedy this feeling? Thanks in advance!"
Anxiety,"I think I may have anxiety now, Help?","Hi Redditors

So it began by procrastinating a lot on assignments and papers, which worked for me. I managed to get things done on time and with a level of quality that was acceptable for my college self, but over the past 2 years it has evolved into something much worse and incapacitating.

Now I'm 5 days away from graduating with approximately 10 large assignments I have left to finish and every time I try to sit down and work on them I start to think about how monumentally fucked I am and my heart begins to race, my breathing gets hard and loud and my hands start to shake until I stop and start doing something else like watch TV, play video games, or browse reddit. The shakiness and heart rate comes whenever I'm not thinking about anything specifically distracting me from my situation.

Any advice on how to mitigate this so that I can actually sit down and get at least some of my work done so that I can graduate would be greatly appreciated!"
Anxiety,Can't decide to take my driving license because of panick attack,"Hey everyone,
I have been delaying starting the driving license courses because for some reason it makes me very anxious. It's not something I want, but I know i have to take them so im not a burden to others. 
But I already get a few panick attacks once in a while (nothing serious, its still manageable), and i am afraid it will get worse. Just the thought of me driving is terrifying, I cant even picture it. 
Does anyone have had the same problem? How did you manage it? Do you fell like you are a burden for your partner etc to get you around with the car?"
Anxiety,I said hello to a stranger,"To other people this is normal, but to me, I felt so excited and empowered when I said hello to a person, I have been so scared to even reply to people, and have never started a conversation or just said hello for the sake of saying hello ever in my life and I feel like I just have to share it because of how much of an accomplishment it is to me."
Anxiety,Hitting myself on anxiety attacks,"This post will be deleted in a couple of days (maybe weeks) because i don´t want it to appear on my profile history. I´m actually writing this because it is my only way of asking for advice/help.

Sometimes, all of a sudden, i get a feeling of uncontrollable anxiety attacks, i start hyperventilating for no reason and the last times i channeled it in the form of rage. I feel an enormous preassure and angerness building inside, mostly because of stupid and meaningless things, till the point it seems that the only way to make it stop is to explode on the outside, screaming and sometimes, even hitting myself. This past years the number of attacks decreased signifficantly than before, it had gotten worse

To make it clear, i´d never, ever hit a wall, a glass or a person/ animal. I mostly hit cushions or stuff that i know it won´t break. The thing is, sometimes i hit myself, yesterday i got so mad i ended up having pretty bad bruises on my fingers that still hurt .I don´t have enough words to describe how ashamed i am of myself for doing that. I´m afraid of doing something unforgivable.

Does anyone else has a similar experience?

Anxiety,"Quarantine makes me want to try to stop using SSRI (Paxil/Seroxate/Paroxetine), tips appreciated since after 21 years I have never actually quit successfully and the withdrawal seems worse than my anxiety.","tl;dr: How did you successfully taper off the use of Paxil/Seroxate/Paroxetine? (I'm on 20mg btw)

&amp;#x200B;

Yep, like the title says I want to quit I'm doing fine in life but generalised anxiety makes me dry heave and is a low key ""energy leak"" that makes me exhausted, but I want to try being off them to see how it is. After all, it's been a long time on them despite I feel relatively like a mild case of a person with anxiety. I'm happy for that despite this being like having an invisible ball and chain around my leg. 

I've realized that the pandemic actually could give me the 3 months of calm work life, a window I feel I would need to discontinue the damn thing. My meds do not make me indifferent or anything, I think I'm actually very much ""me"" compared to the typical posts of people wanting their personality back. 

So why do I want to quit? I want to test ""me"" without the meds. I want to find out if I could be more energetic and get more shit done as I feel sluggish. 

  
Paxil  are known to be hard to get off as the half-life is just 24h, this I really just learned these last few weeks. Prozac on the other hand has a halflife of days, which should make it easier to quit. But I don't want to go through a process of switching drugs if a different drug actually would make me that classic indifferent person as SSRI is often known to do. 

I also have, when lately reading up, suddenly understood that the  weird phenomenon I have of feeling feverish every evening for days on end is most probably the quick half life of my SSRI and not me brewing on something. Just that feeling alone leads to lots of wasted evenings as I stay inactive in front of the TV rather than going for a jog or cleaning the livingroom etc. Stuff like this is what I at least want to try off SSRI no matter if I manage to quit or have to get back on the regular dose. 

I was at the doc today and told him I had already started going down slowly a few weeks from 20mg to 15 to now maybe week 4 I'm on 10mg. And the problem is instantly that I notice the weird mental effects of being on a low dosage or a dosage that is wearing out too fast. I'll get most of the usual dizziness, feverish feeling and basically it makes me want to do as little as possible. At times it feels like the ground is moving like I'm on a boat too. 

Tomorrow I'll be at a small social gathering, I really don't have social anxiety, but knowing I'm on a low dosage actually makes me wonder if I'll suddenly feel queasy due to being on low dosage or any random feeling tapering off this shit can be. I still haven't had those horrible jolts yet. So to morrow can be the classic being anxious about possibly getting anxious. I already feel and fear I will loose track of conversations or somehow my friends will go ""huh, he's weird tonight"". 

And my doc today suggested doing the tapering with 10mg every other day... he clearly hasn't been on SSRI because that was exactly what I feared he'd suggest. There even seems to be drops of SSRI you can do to micro dosage, or I misunderstood.

 My current tactic is doing 10mg today, but 5mg every 12h to avoid getting dizzy due to the low long tail, but I also feel I actually feel dizzy due to doing 10mg that actually could fall off faster than 5mg every 12h. Because I might feel the negative sides strongly 5-6h after I popped a pill, not necessarily 12h after. So it's like a higher concentration leads to a steeper fall in blood concentration (or whatever it is)  and thus a steeper fall and more a sense of ""something is messing with my head"". 

The 10mg every other day-thing seems bad as it will be pretty easy to feel when I am on a higher concentration than if it's near 48h since the last pill. So my tactic is more of splitting the pills smaller and smaller, but as I get into these lower doses I feel I am already getting withdrawal symptoms quite clearly. 

My problem now is also that just as I am getting withdrawal symptoms pretty clearly the world seems to be opening up again, and I don't want to be at work feeling all weird, tired etc. 

I dunno, any tips? Right now it feels like I have 20% of unrest lurking in the back of my mind and in my body, if that gets worse it's like drip torture. It's not super horrible right here and now, but over time it's amazingly tiresome, which is exactly what I guess we all want to get rid of."
Anxiety,Severe stress because of classes,"Hello guys, this is a throwaway account as i feel like my problems are laughable at. I am 22F and going to one of the best Universities in my country (second year). I was a straight A student ever since 1st grade. Literally I have never failed a class. Now, even though my parents say otherwise, I feel like expectstions for me is really high. The bar is set so high, every grade related thing makes me want to puke or feels like my heart stops beating. I am afraid of making a mistake, this leads me to make more and it feels unacceptable. I do not have many friends, I only have my family. Please give me some advice. I do not want to live like this anymore."
Anxiety,My anxiety makes it hurt even more when people are mean to me. Should this even be bugging me?,"So, my husband’s family has always been a major source of anxiety to me. It wasn’t like this at the very beginning, but over time it developed. 

He has two brothers. One of which is older and one is younger. The younger has always been nice to us, until recently. The older has always tried to compete - compare his house to ours, his relationship with his wife to us, his CATS to ours (he literally said “not as cute as our cats” the day we adopted our cats and sent him and his wife photos). They’ve made jabs and then gaslit us every time we tried to explain that what they are doing is hurtful. 

I used to try to talk to them regularly via text, but every time I would say something, no one would respond to me. Then, minutes later one of them would send a text totally unrelated to mine and start talking to each other. So I decided I would give up trying to engage now. Well, we found out they had dinners (the 4 of them - 2 brothers and wives) and other hangouts and never even invited us. That hurt both me and my husband. 

This bothers me everyday. I hate competition. I don’t want to be any part in it. My sister and I are always cheering each other on and happy for everything good that happens to the other without ever feeling resentment, so I don’t understand this behavior. I also hate being ignored and feeling like what is supposed to be my family, hates me. It hurts. It gives me tons of anxiety. It doesn’t help that my MIL is so close to them and never sees any of this because they are good at hiding their snide remarks and jabs from her. So we always end up looking like the bad guys when we decide we don’t want to be around them.

I’m not sure what I want from this post, I’m just really anxious and hurt. Plus, we are trying for a baby and I know they will be angry if we do get pregnant before them, which hurts more because I feel like we aren’t “allowed” to have one now, even though it’s all we think and talk about. It’s like we cater our lives to them and walk on eggshells to not upset them, but they still treat us like dirt. 

TLDR: “family” treats husband and I like we are competition and never includes us. Feeling hurt. 

Anyone experience something like this? How do you handle it?

Anxiety,Physical effects of anxiety even when not “actively” anxious?,"Anxiety had always given me physical effects (nausea, cold sweats, shaking, etc.) but recently I’ve been getting the effects even when I’m not actively anxious about something. Like after I eat I’ve been feeling nauseous. It only lasts for a few minutes but it makes me feel anxious all over again (I have really bad health anxiety). Does this happen to anyone else?"
Anxiety,How do I eat again after a burst of Anxiety?,"This is my (21F) first post in this subreddit but I didn’t know where else to go with this question and I feel it’s going to make my friends/family or doctor get the wrong idea (aka that I have an eating disorder, and I don’t). Basically my most intense anxiety symptom is nausea. Whenever I get an Anxiety attack it always ends in me throwing up and then the upset stomach will linger and linger and it’s awful. Usually the extreme anxiety feeling will last 2-3 days and during this time I won’t eat, then after it clears up the upset stomach feeling is still there (probably because my bodies upset I didn’t eat for 3 days. 

How do I manage the nausea when anxious? How do I make sure I’m still eating properly when I go through these times? Please help. Thanks."
Anxiety,What should I do if I get anxiety about my parents thinking that I’m doing bad things even though I’m not.,"This sort of triggered when I got hit by a car, and now whenever I see my parents after being away from them I get extreme anxiety about them thinking that I’m doing bad things, like drug or alcohol abuse and stuff like that. My heart starts pounding and my hands get sweaty and start shaking. And my mom in particular will notice it and ask me what I’m doing that she wouldn’t approve of. And in the past I’ve considered making up things to get her to stop asking me because saying “nothing” gives me more anxiety because then she thinks that I’m hiding something from even when I’m not. What should I do."
Anxiety,Anyone else getting anxious when eating infront of other people?,"I always feel like I'm the only one who has this, I have many more things that are suppose to be normal but my anxiety took over alot as years past by. I'm just so tired, I feel like I can't function normally and it leaves me emotional and frustrated."
Anxiety,Chest Pain?,"This may need further explanation in the comments, but I’m wondering if anyone else feels intense chest pain when they are particularly anxious or upset about something? This pain (for me) feels like a tight fist squeezing just above my right breast and tingles all the way down my left arm to my fingertips. It usually happens when I’m particularly anxious (I.e. about a fight with an SO, breakup, argument with family,etc). I’ve always wondered if this is a fairly normal sensation for others when they’re upset or if it’s some kind of muscle spasm induced by a panic attack."
Anxiety,Help! I(18f)am having excessive unsatisfying yawns and I can’t breathe all the way in,"I am not diagnosed with anxiety and have never gone to a doctor for it and even if I did have symptoms of anxiety my mom would not take it seriously as in my culture mental health is not taken seriously. I posted this on r/askdocs and my friend told me I should post it on here too. 

I am really panicking since I can’t breathe all the way in and the breaths I inhale are very unsatisfying. When I breathe deep it feels like my lungs are not completely full and it’s making me really anxious and uncomfortable . My chest feels tight. 
this would happen occasionally when I get really upset or really mad or anxious but it wouldn’t continue for days. The recent one started three days before when I was feeling really low and anxious and overwhelmed. I was guessing it’s the anxiety that’s causing me to have unsatisfying yawns and short breaths but now I’m worried bcz it’s been three days and I’m still struggling to take full breaths. I I DON’t have any other symptoms at all but yesterday my finger nails were a pale bluish which I found out was lack of oxygen in the body. I’m really worried, I can’t go to a hospital bcz of the lock down and the hospitals are quite far. 
If it is anxiety, is it normal to have difficulty in breathing for days if it was anxiety?"
Anxiety,Anyone else have those moments?,"Does anybody else have those moments at school where you just have to cry, so you do and then all of a sudden there is 50 people cornering you asking if you are OK for the next 10 minutes but you can't speak so they just keep asking you because there logic is ""well if she hasn't spoken for 20 minutes and she isn't my friend then she will answer me"" so then you keep crying and then someone gets the teacher but you don't know why you are crying so you don't respond and now everyone in the school is asking you why you are crying? Great times."
Anxiety,Should I ask this guy I’m talking to if everything’s okay or just let things go?,I met this guy off tinder and we’ve been talking about a month hungout about a handful of times and we haven’t seen each other in like a week now. We usually will text in between and send cute/funny bitmojis to each other. But lately he’s not responding as often and he hasn’t sent me any cute bitmojis like the ones that say ur cute or are of him blowing a kiss or something like he usually would send me. So I’m kind confused if something is going on. I did ask him like 3 days ago if something was up and he said he was just busy helping his dad because he broke his back but I feel like that still doesn’t mean he can’t send me cute bitmojis anymore when I send him them still and that he doesn’t reply back to messages any sooner than like 2-3 hours now or an hour at the least when he used to reply every 30 minutes at the longest even when he still was helping at his dads when his dad wasn’t injured. So I’m super confused if I should ask him about it again or just let things go? I mean it’s giving me mixed feelings because he still replies to texts it just takes him a lot longer now and he doesn’t send anything saying I’m cute or I miss you or anything.
Anxiety,I'm anxious to talk in messages,I'm too anxious about talking in messages because I think I look fake. It's probably cause I think too much before saying something and I want to talk like others like not really caring and be relaxed but I think I look fake so I just say simple sentences when someone sends me a message and they probably think I don't like talking to them. Example on how fake I sound: person: lol why you answered so late? me: oh i didn't see your message sorry 😂 person: hmm. I think they said hmm because I sounded too fake. What do you think? Any advices?

Anxiety,Bizarre Anxiety Symptom?,"So, as I’m sure most of are, I’m having a seriously hard time coping with my anxiety while being at home 24/7. I was asked to stay home because I had a sinus infection and since a lot of my anxiety is health related, that’s when I started feeling stressed through the day. I was them given a temporary lay off and things have gotten quite a bit worse. I’m fact, I’ve never felt so out of control mentally. My eyes don’t focus, my mind races all the time, my shoulders and neck feel limp periodically, and I seem to constantly be either stressed or panicked.

Last night I fell asleep on the couch facing my TV and I started to have a dream that I was on my phone in the exact position I fell asleep in. It was blurry and very quick because it spooked me and I woke up. It happened again this morning. I woke up with an adrenaline rush around 7:40 and my body felt panicked but my mind didn’t seem to care and I tried falling back asleep and had these types of dreams again. It’s like I’m half asleep and half awake at the same time. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

P.s I took 2mg of Ativan almost 30 hours before the first time it happened."

Anxiety,Always need a deep breathe!,"For the past 5 days, I have constantly felt the urge to take a deep breathe. If I don’t yawn or take that deep breathe, I get an uncomfortable feeling and tightness in my chest and my heart starts to race. I take a deep breathe/yawn every minute I’d say. This cycle constantly repeats unless im asleep (I don’t sleep often anymore). My doctor told me it was anxiety and put me on zoloft but I still feel it’s more than that. I don’t have asthma or any underlying lung conditions that I know of. This has been driving me absolutely crazy. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Anxiety,My job is destroying me and I have no idea what I'm doing,"I'll try to make this short because I don't care to type out something long.

* I probably have some combination of GAD/depression/Aspergers/ADHD.

* I don't have any friends and I'm all alone.

* I started a complicated engineering job a few months ago and I still have no idea what I'm doing. I have to talk to people all the time, I still don't understand half of the program I'm in (this is *not* imposter syndrome, I legitimately suck), I can't focus and I'm barely getting anything done and everyone is realizing how fucking pathetic I am, and I feel like shit and I'm on the verge of tears half the time.

* My job has a security clearance and I may lose it ans my job if I try to get help.

* My parents paid for my college and I can't just quit and do something else and betray them.

I don't know what to do. I thought finally getting through college and getting a job would make me happier, but I'm worse than ever."

Anxiety,I (F24) can't stop having panic attacks whenever my boyfriend mentions other girls. Anyone else get this? How do you make it stop?,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. Last year, my mom revealed to me the reason she and my father got divorced was because he was having this affair and the whole thing played out very nasty.

Ever since she told me, I've been getting panic attacks whenever my boyfriend mentions another girl. We've been together for 6 years and he's never done anything to make me not trust him, we have a fantastic relationship, and I love him to pieces.

But, for example, he mentioned he talked to a girl at work (something that would normally never bother me) and I got lightheaded and felt like I was spinning, I was sick to my stomach, and it felt like my mouth was glued shut. It lasts for easily 20 minutes and happens every time, over the slightest mention.

Although he knows about my parents affair and my diagnosis, I don't want him to think I don't trust him because I do. And I don't want to ask him to not talk about other girls because they are obviously going to be a part of his life and I don't want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells in our conversations. I've tried using the grounding techniques I was taught by my doctor, but they don't work. 

Does anyone else have this problem? And if so, how do you and your partner make it work? How can I make it stop?"
Anxiety,Wondering about if there's any data on xanax a d coronavirus,"I'm severely worried that if i end up getting coronavirus my anxiety will make the disease a lot worse for me.

And elevated blood pressure (which goes along with my anxiety) is a big factor in fatal cases. Has there been any research about taking xanax while infected? Anyone know if this would be safe or if taking xanax would do more harm than good?"

Anxiety,Is it sage to split Citalopram?,"My doc gave me 10mg pills, told me to start with cutting the pill in half or even quarters. He mentioned “its ok even if the pill are uneven sizes”.

Well the first day I split the pill I felt really tired, when I ate the other half the next day I felt this sudden nervous energy, third day I split a new pill and I felt tired, when I ate the other half the next day I felt this nervous energy again.

It seems as if when I take a fresh pill and take a half it makes me tired. When I take the next half the following day it gives me nervous energy and jitters. What could this be? Does having a pill cut in half and leaving it stored affect its potency? My appointment isnt until next week so I can’t tell my doc yet."

Anxiety,Anyone else afraid of needles but not because they’re needles?,"I need to get a shot. I used to be fascinated by needles, blood taken out, gore, etc. but, I’ve always had a huge fair of loss of control AKA fainting. I never have fainted. Getting a shot, I never felt scared or light headed. In one of my classes 2 years ago we learned about how seeing injury/blood/getting a shot commonly makes people faint. Well. Good thing I was up to date on vaccines because I’ve been avoiding them since. I’m better with blood now and but still try to avoid other people’s injuries at times.

I am terrified of passing out or getting close to it while getting this vaccine. Also, my panic attacks around fainting are the WORST and I already know I’ll look like an idiot fidgeting, panicking, pacing, etc. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? If I or family members have never fainted from getting a shot, would I not too? Thanks."

Anxiety,Dealing with physical symptoms of anxiety: A (very long) story time.,"Hi all,

I'm writing this for future people who may stumble across this thread in a search result. Threads like this helped me in some way, so this is my way of giving back. A lot of this will seem discombobulated, but I'm not proofreading this.

Around 4 years ago, I woke up one day with a very strange symptom. I don't know how to describe it other than a ""waviness vertigo"". Essentially, it feels like the earth is moving up and down slowly. This feeling was 24/7. Sometimes, it will feel like its dropping very quickly. At this point, I was an undergrad. When I noticed it wasn't going away, it consumed my whole life. I couldn't focus in classes. The thought of having this forever caused some dark thoughts to rush to my head. I started googling symptoms. Was 100% convinced I had a brain tumor.

I've always had anxiety issues. Before this, I had symptoms which had a similar progression. For example, in high school, I took ibuprofen when I got headaches. It always worked. When one day, it didn't go away with ibuprofen, the headache persisted for months. All of my doctors told me it was physical symptoms produced by anxiety. Eventually, my doctor caved, and ordered a brain scan. It came back normal. A few weeks later, the headache subsided. I thought to myself, man, maybe it was anxiety after all.

Sorry for the tangent. Back to this ""episode"" in undergrad. My point is, when you have an anxiety disorder, the next time a similar thing happens, all logic goes out the window. I went to every doctor imaginable. Everything came back normal. This consumed my life. I thought, once again, I had a brain tumor. For a long time, my therapist encouraged me to try medication, but I refused for the longest time. When I hit rock bottom, I thought to myself, what do I have to lose? I was terrified, but I finally took that first dose of 25 mg of Zoloft. Of course, with that small of a dose, nothing changed. I had to drop the semester and go home because I could not function in school. There's so many more stories I could tell, but they are quite personal and involve family. All I can say is, I'm grateful I had such a supportive family throughout this ordeal.

When I got home, a few weeks went by and things still were not better. I broke down one day and demanded another brain scan. We went to the ER, and they obliged. Once again, shocker, no brain tumor. I was temporarily relieved from the stress. But the symptom was still there and the feeling of dread came right back. As this was all happening, I was slowly increasing my medication. Eventually I got to 100 mg of Zoloft, which is a pretty standard dose. Because I was so bored at home, I started getting out of bed and playing League of Legends. The turnaround here was when I noticed I didn't feel anything when I started playing, because I was so focused on the game. I think the medication helped me think in a more rational mindset. I thought to myself, it suddenly goes away when I play a video game? I didn't know League was a cure for the other things I thought I had like MS. Of course it isn't, but this change in my thought patterns was helping tremendously. Within weeks, I was 100% back to normal. I couldn't wait to go back to school! I eventually finished undergrad, and the symptom subsided for 4 years. Keep in mind, I was still taking 100 mg of Zoloft every day.

Fast forward to September 2019. A few months prior, I moved across the country to pursue grad school. I was trying to go to sleep one night, when all of a sudden, that feeling of ""waviness"" came back. I couldn't believe it. It was almost 4 years to the exact date when the other episode started. I tried convincing myself that it was because I was taking a different manufacturers generic Zoloft. When I switched back to the original manufacturer, it still persisted. I was devastated. When I wasn't forced to do work with classmates, or go to class, I stayed in bed almost all the time. My appetite became non-existent. I could not believe this was happening again. I was terrified to go out, because I was scared of falling or something? I don't know. My psychiatrist recommended I up my medication. I obliged, first going to 150 mg. This is now getting into the higher doses of Zoloft. First thing I noticed was a massive increase in appetite, which wasn't a bad side-effect in my case. Unlike the last time this happened, I never missed a single class. My grades didn't slip. I powered through it, unlike in undergrad 4 years ago. But mentally, it was taking its toll. Dark thoughts started to invade my brain again. I wouldn't say I was suicidal, it was more like, if a car ran me over right now, I wouldn't care, you know? After forcing myself to go to class, go out with friends, go to events, etc, I started to become more confident. Yeah the symptoms were still there, but I could at least function. However, I really wanted to destroy this waviness. My doctor upped my Zoloft to 200 mg, which is the max recommended dose for anxiety (I think you can go higher for treatment of OCD.)

The symptoms still persisted 7 months later. I would periodically google symptoms. Started to convince myself I had Menieres Disease (even though I had no hearing loss, lol.) Got sad again, because it's incurable. I finished classes, and quarantine started. I had all the time in the world, which for someone like me, is both a blessing and a curse. However, every time something like this happens to me, I learn a little bit from the last experience. I knew I couldn't just stay in bed all the time. When there's nothing else on your mind, your brain will invent something for you. And for someone with an anxiety disorder, it's usually destructive. So I started getting back into hiking. I only drank socially, very little prior to this. But I figured I would get into craft beer, so I started bringing beer up with me up the hikes. When I got to the top, I would treat myself with a beer. Before I say the next part, I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not recommending treating anxiety with alcohol. I don't drink more than a pint at one time, unless drinking out with friends, which is rare. I also try to drink not more than once every two days. Anyways, when I would finish my pint and get buzzed, I was so fucking happy. I felt like the person I should be. Just enjoying life. That feeling of waviness/dizziness? Yeah, totally gone. Didn't even come into my mind. You know what alcohol does? It has anti-anxiety properties. Once again, I am not advocating treating anxiety disorders with alcohol. That would be very stupid. However, it helped me put two and two together. Alcohol led to a complete elimination of the waviness, at least until it wore off. Like how League of Legends did the same for me 4 years ago, drinking helped my thinking become more rational. The symptoms became less and less apparent after this experience. They are still there, but much less intense, and not 24/7 as before. I feel like I got my life back. I never saw a single doctor throughout this ordeal (except my psychiatrist), so I guess I pat myself on the back for that.

When I began to realize this was certainly caused by severe anxiety, I started to notice other patterns in my behavior that were caused by anxiety, but always thought were normal. For example, when walking down the street, I always have to look back because I think the person I just walked by has a knife, and will turn around and try to kill me because he/she is crazy. Of course, this is not rational thinking. Another thing is, always thinking that people are looking at me in a large setting, like a supermarket. Once again, common in anxiety, but not rational. But this is how my brain is wired. And you know what? That's OK. I definitely need to work on these thoughts. The one regret I have is not seeing a therapist throughout this, but that is my next step in my journey.

In closing, here's a few key tips I have:

1. Don't be scared of medication. I was that person who was absolutely terrified of side-effects. However, I had zero negative side-effects from Zoloft, even at a high dose of 200 mg. As long as you start small and titrate slowly, side-effects should be minimal. But everyone is different!
2. DO NOT GOOGLE SYMPTOMS. This is 100% the worst thing you can do. Every doctor will tell you this. They know you and the diseases you think you have a lot more than you. Listen to them instead of WebMD.
3. Try to force yourself outside your comfort zone, and do some activity that doesn't involve sitting in bed. It will be incredibly tough at first. You won't want to do it anymore. But you must persist. Doing nothing will only cause you to be trapped in your own feelings. And feelings lie.

Sorry if this is difficult to read because of the stream-of-consciousness-like writing, but I had to get this off my chest."

Anxiety,Anxiety only in the evening,"From googling I can see this is fairly common, but I'm wondering whether anyone can suggest anything that might help.

During the day I'm absolutely fine, and usually by the time I go to bed I'm kind of ok too, but evenings are absolutely terrible for anxiety for me. I worry about real and imagined problems, and it makes me feel awful and act irritable towards my husband. I can't really concentrate on watching tv because I'm busy catastrophising, or furiously googling potential solutions to problems that might never arise.

I'm pretty busy at work and I could really do with winding down in the evening, but it's just impossible. Any tips for dealing with this would be greatly appreciated! I don't take any medication, I feel like going to the doctor for this is a bit of a pisstake since it's just a 2-3 hours a day (and not even every day).

Thanks!"
Anxiety,How not to get shaky and emotional when you affirm yourself?,"I found out I became a people pleaser just so I don’t get bugged. Also I kinda grew up fearing of disappointing people, so whenever I do something I dont master or someone bugs me too much and I gotta put him straight I do raise my voice and affirm myself but my voice gets weird I get shaky my throat gets sore as if a child was gonna get in trouble. 

I hate it!"
Anxiety,Social Anxiety and self-esteem,"How is your self-esteem?

Do you know your true Self or you feel stuck in the experience of thoughts that are blocking the perception of the real you?

Though to social conditioning we end up developing a perception of ourselves that is very distorted, we pick up on many different beliefs that though to our great power than become reality.

So we suddenly start to believe that we are an anti-social person, we believe to not be interesting, we think that we’re shy till to the point where we attach to our identity the label “social anxiety”.

But what if all of these were just labels?

What if your real nature is always free, then this would mean that you never had a problem in the first place, isn’t it cool and scary at the same time?

My experience in this journey was one of healing and self-acceptance and this brought a complete transformation in my life.

The first thing that I would like to tell you is to be aware of yourself without judgment, the more aware we become the more we realize our real power and with this, we can create a powerful change.

You can be free, anxiety is your friend:)"
Anxiety,Too scared to leave my room to fill up my water and go to the toilet.,"Someone set my house on fire, as in, they put a jerry can outside my window, stuffed a rag down it, and lit it up.

Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life.,"I’m posting here because I am in need of serious advice and words of reassurance. This may be long but please bear with me. 

I suffer from significant anxiety. I am almost 24 years old and my life is pathetic. I finished up my masters degree recently and passed my professional board exam and now I’m just...existing. Finding a job is enough to send me into a full blown panic attack. The thought of going to work literally makes me start sobbing. I have no idea how to do anything or how to function in the world. I am currently living with my parents who don’t understand my condition. I am constantly compared to my brother, who in their eyes is “very successful” and my peers. 

I had big dreams and ambitions. Now I’m a pathetic loser who can’t even apply for jobs because I’m so anxious. I’m still on my parents insurance so I can’t seek professional help at the moment. I want to change and get my life on track but I don’t know how. 

So, people of reddit, the million dollar question is: how can I get unstuck and actually find meaning in my life? How do I overcome my anxieties and make something of myself?"

Anxiety,Im a little nervous if I have brain cancer (it sounds dumb I know),"Back in march I gave myself a little electric shock. It wasnt too bad at all I didnt pass out or anything but it gave me chest pains for a little while. I was so worried about the chest pains that I ended up giving myself bad anxiety and I wasnt abled to sleep very well at night. Slowly over time the anxiety got worse and I started worrying about stuff that I wouldnt normally worry about. The chest pains are gone now because I have determined that the chest pains were in the long run just due to the anxiety but a few days ago the stress of all the anxiety had bottled up so much I started getting headaches that I had never experienced before. I looked up the headache sypmtoms and discovered that its called a muscle contracting headache usually caused by stress and anxiety. Those headaches have calmed down too but still sometimes I get head pain. A couple days ago I started worrying that I have brain cancer because I looked up the symptoms and I have a few brain cancer symtoms like headaches,tingling feeling in head (that only happens at night when I start worrying about stuff) fatigue and maybe tiny memory problems.  BUT I also recently learend that the symptoms I have can also be related too anxiety,stress, and sleeping problems. On Sunday I only slept about 3-4 hours when I usually need 8 or 9. And on tuesday I only slept around 3 hours. The last 2 months ever since the electric shock ive only been sleeping 6-8 hours very rarely 10 hours and its been late too. I would usually fall asleep around 4am. This week has been bad because of the short sleep I got on Sunday and tuesday. Theres also a faint dark circles that have formed under my eye lids. So what is it guys? do you think its because of lack of sleep? anxiety and stress? or do I really have brain cancer....... It should also be mentioned NONE of this was occouring before that small electric shock incident. Im growing kind of nervous about this but im trying my hardest to keep it cool."

Anxiety,Advice for SSRI,"I'm a 23 yr male in college, generally healthy I work out at least five days a week and eat fairly healthy. For some time since high school I remember having some mild anxiety, nothing crazy would normally manifest during stressful situations. Recently (last two three years) developed very infrequent panic attacks, normally triggered by a stressful event (meeting someone for the first time, presentation, big test...etc.) however would normally go away very quickly and would not return. Since the start of school being cancelled and the virus manifesting, last few weeks, I've been having really grappling panic attacks, like to the point where I think I'm going to pass out, and they come on for no apparent reason or trigger. I am scared to get in a car or go out in public for the fear that I might have one. I know that covid-19 is a big stressor for a lot of people, however I am not afraid of getting it myself or going into places where I might get it, so I know this isn't the trigger causing this new onset of potential panic attacks. 

I really want to talk to my PCP about the possibility of getting treatment and consider my options (ssri's). However, I'm nervous in the sense that I've never talked to him about my anxiety and that he'll recommend breathing exercises and meditation to help manage it (which I've already tried and doesn't help me much). So, I just wanted to ask how others brought this up and what you'd recommend for what I should be expecting/hoping for. While I would really rather not have to take anything for this, I fear that if I don't this will continue, and things will just get worse. I read that SSRI's are very effective in terms of treating anxiety / panic attacks, and the side effects are less than that of other medications such as Xanax, so I can continue to live life as a normal 23 yr old. Any suggestions would be appreciated thanks!"
Anxiety,Interaction with somebody off of dating app making me uncomfortable and anxious,"Hey there,
For context, suffer from GAD &amp; depression &amp; possibly ADHD (currently in the process of getting evaluated). This includes a bit of social anxiety.

In general, I’m not somebody really interested in a relationship. I’ve been single most of my life and pretty ok with it since I feel like I’m pretty selective who I feel comfortable around and take a pretty long time deciding that, except as I’m getting older there’s a bit of pressure to find somebody and I’ve turned to dating apps. Mostly, they haven’t worked. I hardly get matches and when I do, they’re junk matches where the guy wouldn’t even talk but occasionally I’ll get somebody who is being serious. 

Not long ago, I matched with somebody who I feel like shares some interests with me but not entirely. In only 2 weeks of talking I felt like they were thinking we’re super compatible but I wasn’t quite feeling the same way. Though we share similar ideas in terms of academics &amp; politics, beyond that I’m interested in sports and music and have a really weird sense of humor as a result of my anxiety &amp; depression that only few people seem to get. As time went on, there were other things rubbing me off a little wrong: when I asked if they have any friends in the city theyre currently living in, they said no and they’re not interested in trying to make new friends, they’re just looking for “the one” and would only make friends if it happened to come through the relationship. As somebody who deals with social anxiety and doesn’t have very many friends of my own, I still make it a point to have acquaintances and friendships. I was starting to get clingy vibes and it was feeling like we weren’t going to be compatible. I decided it would be unfair to keep faking enthusiasm, so I wrote a long explanation how I’m really not interested in a relationship, was just trying out apps due to pressure and realize I have a lot of things going on in my life including anxiety and want to work on myself. They were pretty nice about it and said they thought I was a nice person and would like to keep in touch through social media. I said sure, why not.

I hardly use social media but get notified of messages. They messaged me a few months later trying to strike up conversation and ask if I’m interested again, they thought we’re so natural when we talk (which I didn’t feel but ok). I said um no, I’m still not interested based off the things I said earlier. 

Then they’d message me on occasion, for my birthday, which was fine. Later as the social distancing was happening, they messaged me again asking me to “stay safe!!” lol. Later, I noticed they’ve been liking many of my posts recently, including some I don’t know if they totally even know what I’m talking about. At some point they used the post as a springboard to message me again and spark a conversation updating me about their life. 

I’m starting to get slightly annoyed, especially because I thought I made it clear I’m not interested in moving forward with a relationship. On one hand, I’d like to give the benefit of doubt and hope they’re just being friendly, on the other hand considering we met on a dating app, I’m kind of feeling that by liking my posts and dropping occasional “check-in” messages, they stay on my radar and I either find the effort really flattering or come around eventually. I know that as women, we’re kind of expected to eventually fall for this niceness, and I do feel a pang of guilt for not showing interest, but I feel like if I only started showing interest out of guilt, I’d be so dishonest. The idea of being in a relationship and having to think about somebody else while I’m working on myself is too much for me, personally. Plus, I don’t really feel me &amp; this dude really share much in common. He may be nice at least from the 2 weeks I’ve talked to him, but he seems clingy and I can already feel if I’d move further, he’d be depending on me for all his social needs, which exhaust me thinking about it.

Some friends have suggested blocking, but I have simply ignored the messages for now. I do feel quite bad because I’m assuming this person is lonely as they’re from abroad with few family and perhaps friends in the area, but I thought I was so clear about not wanting to be in a relationship &amp; they’re still being persistent in a way that’s starting to increase my anxiety. Am I wrong to feel this way?"
Anxiety,How do I trust my gut when anxiety hits? What are the correct ways to cope with it?,
Anxiety,"I want to socialize, but only when I see others do it","\[17M\] When I was a kid, I was an extrovert (some people misunderstand the meaning of extrovert and introvert). I always wanted to play with others, be around my friends. When there was a day off, and I couldn't meet with them, I was bored as hell. 

In elementary school and the beginning of high school I was social as well. I had a specific set of people whom I called friends. I liked to hang out with them. I was not inhibited. I could think freely, without any doubt. I could enjoy being around others.

Now, before quarantine, it was different. Something change inside me, and became a person who was on his own instead of who likes being around others. My grades and my future was improving (unlike my ""social future""). I could concentrate on my studies. But soon I realized that studying is not the meaning of life. After this realization, that was a very hard part of my life, with full of panic attacks (2-3 weekly), anxiety (since it started, when I was 12) and depression. Naturally I attended therapy sessions. They didn't help that much, but I could better understand myself, only after the sessions were over.  

During quarantine I feel better, strangely. I've noticed it before, that I only want to socialize when I see or hear that people are doing it as well. When people were talking in the school, on the corridor, I would just go up to someone and talk. But during classes I was quiet, and I liked that we weren't allowed to talk. On classes others were not socializing, just like me. That's why I feel amazingly better during these times, because I don't see others who meet regularly or just hang out together. Is it weird? I just want a life where I can easily socialize, just like my childhood self could. Will that identity come back after my teenage? Will I be that open minded, social and uninhibited person once again after I become an adult?"

Anxiety,Advice needed please - The unknown of friends or more is causing me great anxiety.,"I (20/F) have been talking to this guy (22/M) for about a month now and we became mates. We met in a shared class at Uni after we were partnered up together for a project. Since then we have texted each other pretty regularly and video chatted a few times. I am unsure where I stand with him though as I seem to get mixed signals. At times, he and I will have an easy-flowing text conversation back and forth. He compliments me a lot, uses a lot of emojis, and sometimes says cheeky remarks. I am unsure if he is flirting with me or if I am reading too far into our interactions? Can anyone explain how they know for sure that someone is flirting with them through text? But then there are also times where he does not respond to my text message for a few days and just seems distant. He did confess to me that he is going through a hard time right now, so that could be a part of the reasoning behind his actions. I am a bit concerned for him, but since we recently became friends I don’t wish to overstep my boundaries or come off as a hindrance. I don’t want to be a bother towards him, but this whole situation is making me anxious and I cannot stop thinking about it.

Due to his mixed signals, I just don’t know how to act towards him. How do I know if he thinks of me as a friend or more? Is there a sure fire way to know either way (without asking him because I do not feel comfortable doing that right now). It’s hard to judge behavior when the only interaction we have towards each other is online (because of the virus). 

Thank you for your input."
Anxiety,Do I have Trichotillomania?,"Sorry this may not be the right sub for this but I don't know which would fit

Over the past few months I've constantly been battling an uncontrollable urge to touch my eyebrows. I've done abit of googling and came across articles talking about people with similar things to me: Where they can't stop pulling their eyebrows. Now I myself don't actually pull them out but I do touch them very frequently (≈Every 2-5 mins). I started because I always felt something was 'wrong' with them and they needed to be fixed. But now I do it subcontiously and have done it numerous times whilst writing this. I understand Trichotillomania is a symptom of anxiety but I don't think I have anxiety myself, as I've never displayed any symptoms. 

I used to do a similar thing when I was younger when I couldn't stop touching my teeth. (which I still do now but less frequently). The problem is, my eyebrows are getting really thick from them constantly being moved around. I'm always trying to restrain myself from it but I always accidently find myself doing it. Can anyone help?"
Anxiety,[advice] How to deal with my aunt’s depression and anxiety?,"Hi guys. I need advice. So my aunt lives with us. She’s in her 40s and is a nurse (this is important). She’s seemed to struggle with anxiety for the past 10 years as she gets anxiety from going to work because she’s dealt with the typical messy coworkers talking behind everyone’s back. It seems she doesn’t take criticism well either and thinks anything is a personal attack. She overthinks small things and lets any small incident at work or at home ruin her day. She changes jobs a lot because she is never happy or satisfied and I told her maybe she should try speaking to a therapist because there is an underlying issue. 

Well since Covid-19 her anxiety has gotten worse and I think she’s going to worry herself to actual death. She won’t go out to get essentials because she’s scared of getting infected. That means we go get stuff from the store she thinks we are exposed. We go through Lysol spray and wipes within 2 days and it’s extremely hard to find them in store. When we get groceries we literally have to make dishwater with Clorox and dip whatever is packaged well in the water to disinfect it before it goes in the fridge. She takes her temp every 30 minutes and I’m not exaggerating she also checks her oxygen more than that. She has a sunken look and she’s lost so much weight. She looks so tired and I know she’s not getting rest. She was prescribed anxiety medicine from her doctor and it seems like it’s not helping but then again she doesn’t take them when she needs to because she says she doesn’t like medicine. 

I’ve suggested Covid-tests to ease her mind. I’ve suggested a psychiatrist because I think her mental health is a reason for this. She’s a school nurse and even says she may not go back to work because she doesn’t think she’ll be safe in August. She said she would rather stay home. We (me and my mom) wake up in the middle of the night and stay up for hours with her because she wakes us up because she says she is getting woken up from her sleep with anxiety and her heart rate goes up and she never goes back to sleep. She’s barely able to sustain herself. I don’t know what to do. We have tried suggesting everything under the sun and we don’t know what to do. I hate to admit to you guys that it’s starting to make me a little depressed but I feel like I’m walking on egg shells all the time and all day is talk about her health. I will never tell her that but it’s starting to take a toll on me because i try to always be there for her and be encouraging as my mom takes the tough love approach. It’s draining a little so what more could I do to help her during this tough time?"
