depression,Does therapy help,Just wondering if therapy even does anything been on antidepressants for around a year now even had my dose made higher three times but they still don’t work I just want a way to feel something again
depression,How do I stop the cycle?,I have been super depressed for about 4 years and only mildly depressed before that. But the decisions I make I can see why I am depressed. I can’t tell if I make myself depressed or I make bad decisions because I am depressed. Where do you get the willpower from to change after its been so long and your life is so bad that even the smallest things seem so big to change? I can’t get out of the cycle.
depression,Confused and lost,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel more and more restless everyday, waiting for something to happen, but you don’t even know what that something is. And as days go by, you become more and more disillusioned and lost and you don’t even know what you’re doing anymore or why you’re doing anything at all. And all this just makes you so exhausted that you wonder what even is the point of anything and you just have energy left to go on."
depression,I'm giving up. last therapy appointment today,"Its 330 am. Its been 2 years of ""therapy"". 3 years of not working. I do nothing. I am nothing. But a burden. Its not a idea. Its a fact. I can't make myself change. I dont even want to. I just want it to stop. Idk why im posting this. Its getting to the point where I'm just either numb or angry. Very angry. I'm done."

depression,Exhaustion,"I’ve never been happy my entire life. I had a horrible childhood with abusive parents to the point that I can’t function. I hear a loud noise and I lock up for a bit because I’m afraid it’s my dad ready to hit me again, I wasn’t allowed to leave my house and socialize so I have no social skills to go out and make friends. My only relationship after 21 years of living turned out horrible and scarred me multiple ways

I finally found someone who I truly cared for, loved deeply beyond belief and would do anything for, literally everything I’ve ever wanted out of someone in a relationship, but of course they are on the other side of the world. Like how cruel is that. It’s like I finally get handed a bone in life, but it’s got all of these different catches for me to actually earn that bone (even though my entire life up to this point might as well have been the catches to earn the bone). Then when I finally decide to make the most of the situation and rise to the challenge, that bone is taken away.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t find enjoyment in anything anymore, I have no drive to do anything better with myself, I just don’t know what to do. I did everything I could to make her as happy as I could and it wasn’t enough. I just never feel I’m enough and life keeps proving that feeling correct

I don’t even have the energy to finish this post. I just want to be ignored by everyone, I want to rot away and do nothing with my life. 

I don’t even know what I want from making this post. Maybe I just want someone to hear my problems and pretend they care, maybe I just want to vent my problems to the wind and then forget about them like I’ve always done, maybe I want someone to reach out. I don’t even know. I guess maybe some guidance on what to do with myself would be nice"
depression,I CARE!,"I will read your post and try my best to respond because I care about you, anyone who’s dealing with sadness, anxiousness, loneliness, depression, etc. I care!! You don’t have to go through it alone! If I could/can help and and save someone, I freaking will!"
depression,I think I might explode.,"Hey. I have controlling parents, I cut off a really close toxic friend a month ago (he has depression, anxiety and ADHD) and this is the longest I have spent not talking to him, my boyfriend doesn't have time for me, I lost my position in my college society because I failed to come to the interview, my friends are in different states, I have harm OCD and basically I feel lonely. I am not lonely mind it...but I feel lonely.

Sometimes I think....if I off myself...that'd be the most peaceful I'd feel in a long time...I cannot believe I am saying this; I swear if you saw me at my prime I was so happy, joyous, laughing girl. I made everyone's day. People called me because they knew talking to me would make them happy. I have some really genuine friends....and my boyfriend loves me. My parents do too...but I just wanna rest man. I felt so happy looking through some tombstones epitaphs. Somehow.

I feel drained now. I don't really have much expectations from anyone. I have been let down too much. Fuck I have let myself down too. 

I talk politely. I have never raised my voice on anyone. I dont have angry outbursts. I dont even remember the last time I felt angry. I find no will. I am surrounded by people who love me. They really do. And would be broken if I leave. But....

I think I have lit the match. I will soon burn the bridge. Not anytime soon but I know I would go down with it.

Things will get better tomorrow, I will laugh and go on a double date with my boyfriend, meet my friends, go to college, study literature...do the things I love but now it has become lifeless. I don't...feel it.

Sorry if this seems like a damsel in distress lmao. Just letting out stuff buried in me."
depression,i wish someone could understand my pain,"Everyone is mad at me , disappointed and that shit, feeling like no one cam understand me except people from this sub, why i have to be like this, i wish i was normal i am tired of being judged"
depression,I'm alive because other people want me to be.,"Just wanted to put that out into the void of the internet, I just wanna stop existing but my friends and family forcefully keep me alive."
depression,Wondering if I’m getting depression?,"I’m 21F in college. Found out I was pregnant and got left by him after. I loved him too.

 I’m trying to be logical about everything: that we wouldn’t have ever worked, that it was a matter of time, that I really wouldn’t want to be with a person that abandoned me, that I dodged a bullet. 

Now I’m done with dating until I can figure out how to be happy by myself. But that’s turning out to be more difficult than I thought. I’ve lost interest in everything. I don’t feel happy or even feel like myself when hanging out with my friends (I was an extrovert). I don’t crave anything (food/cooking used to be my hobby). Getting out of bed is hard bc I think about how he wronged me the second I wake up. My mind just feels lost. 

I’ve been through breakups before. I worked out, cooked, wrote, joined a sorority, went out, made great girl friends, had a blast with them. This time feels so different. Therapy is good in general, but I don’t have the finances to comfortably support it. Any advice? Should I just really turn for medical help?"

depression,I hate time so fucking much,I hate being alive and in pain I just wanna die young so that the pain of having to live is over quickly. I'm petrified of losing my dad and I can't take the thought I wasn't even supposed to be born I wish I wasn't born so that I wouldn't have had to go through the pain of life and struggling to stay happy. How the fuck are people happy living until 50 with a family??????? How?????
depression,Teenage alcoholic and I'm ready to just give up,"I've spent my whole life in the background, I've never had friends and my parents never loved me and now I'm just ready to quit, I dropped out of high school at 16 and I'm 18 now and still haven't accomplished anything, I don't feel anything anymore and it's so fucking scary, I have nothing left, no family, friends, girlfriend or anywhere to go, I always told myself it would get better but now all I have left is drugs and alcohol, things they start to get better and I start to see hope and then something just fucking clicks and I'm drinking or taking pills until I fall asleep every morning I wake up covered in my own fucking spit and a headache and I never learn, I always told my self it would get better but I'm starting to let go and I'm scared, telling myself this is scaring me now and I have all these thoughts and it's so bad and I don't know what to do, I've tried therapy I've tried exercising I've tried detoxing everything and nothing works and I'm just readt to give up, I just need someone to check on me, someone to care and I eamn it, I can't fill my heart and sometimes it's just easier to fill my fucking cup and I'm embarrassed of myself. I look in the mirror and don't even fucking recognize myself, and the loneliness is so fucking bad, so so bad and I can't fucking take it, I haven't genuinely talked to someone in 2 fucking years and I'm fucking losing it, I don't go to school and I don't work so I can't meet anyone and I think I'm just fucking ready to end it"
depression,Help for an empathetic psychopath?,"I'm gonna make this short and simple. Due to childhood and family trauma, I have different personalities where I organize different feelings. My main me is an anxious and depressed empath who wants harmony and peace in society. My doppelganger is psychopathic serial abuser, drugger, manipulator, prospective killer, and suicidal maniac. He has more than a dozen sexual harassment and assault victims. I have been firmly in control for the past couple years, and he's done some regrettable things but nothing prison worthy in that time. I've only recently become aware of his existence and most of his memories I had no recollection of. Every day I remember more and become more and more terrified of the monster inside of me. He can do anything and has no limits. He has every psychopathic tendency at once. 

I know I need help. A lot of help. The only therapists I've ever been to were religious gay conversion therapists that my parents sent me to as a kid, so I don't have the best reaction to therapy, but I need to push through it. I'm completely broke rn and going through a lot so I can't afford therapy if I wanted to. I can't ask my family for help because they'd inevitably send me to a religious counselor and I'd just gaslight my way out of it as usual. I can't ask my gf's family to pay for it because that's not fair and they have their own struggles to worry about. 

I really need help and I don't know where to look so here I am."
depression,Having a day scheduled to die,"Thoughts of having a day scheduled to die maybe in 5-10 years and during that time you would do your best with whatever *you're* interested, *you're* enjoying even if they're not considered as things worth doing or important by *experts* in the society.

Please don't be offended, I really want to know what you think of this idea ..... by experts I meant those who pretend to have a certain, solid reason for what we are doing on this random floating rock orbiting a star in a cold, dark space.

depression,car accident &amp; burnout,"Been through a lot of stress that culminated in a mental breakdown where I almost got into a car accident. After that I cried for an entire day while going to school and still having academic obligations. I have finally caught a break from school now, and at first I knew I was being lazy but now I feel this heavy exhaustion and anger. I have done nothing for 4 days, and I have pending deadlines that NEED to be met. I don’t feel the numb depressed feeling, I just feel angry and lazy. I have managed to make myself shower and still eat and function but I have things I want to get done but can’t perform properly. I just can’t get the energy to continue at any task I start and have been causing fights with family. I am so exhausted."
depression,Sometimes I Look Back and Hate Myself For What I've Done,"A few years ago my mother (who emotionally abuses me) took me out for a night on the town. We grabbed drinks and then she took me to see a concert.

I was so ungrateful that I had a shitty attitude all night long. I remember when the band was playing a song (I can't quite remember the name, but it was light and uplifting) I had a massive frown on my face the entire time.

Maybe this was her way of apologizing? Was she trying to make things right?

I'll never forgive myself for being so negative and sour. She wanted to do something fun with me, her only son, and I let my bad attitude spoil it.

I'm such a dickhead. I deserve the bad things that happen to me."
depression,I feel like a ghost,"Been a while since I went off of all social media and I feel a little like I don't exist irl just because I don't have an online presence. I don't feel seen by anyone, anywhere. Its so hard to connect with anyone. I feel like a background character everywhere. I honestly like it that way and don't want attention but it makes me feel unimportant. I have no close friends. I feel so starved for emotional support but there's no one."
depression,Never sharing how I truly feel ever again,I expressed how I feel unloved and unneeded by everyone to my best friend and she just said my cat loves me… which has left me feeling even more sad than I was originally
depression,She's out with another guy,"I'm not good enough for her, or even anyone.

Seeing everyone else and even her be better off without me is killing me inside

Everyday just feels empty, being all by myself as if the hours we spent talking to each other was nothing."
depression,I booked a flight (other side of the world),More than 10y of depression and I STILL dont know how to manage it. I'm on my dark period right now I stopped working for months and on the paper I'm studying from home (UNI) but I didn't open a single pdf since the start of the year. I took my saving Less than 3k and booked a flight with the hope of feeling a bit better i'm leaving soon for a country that I like but i'm not that excited I used to travel a lot but this time i'm feeling NOTHING i'll just get on the plane and i'll see. I'll took my computer to see of i'll want to start studying(It will be a miracle). My mental health is a complete mess yesterday I took a shower cause the smell was just too much after 1month. I'LL come back with nothing but I HOPE to regain a bit of energy to take care of myself. I'm a female (29) a complete failure I didn't graduate from my studies yet cause I was never able to EITHER finish the year or start one. Worked part job never full time cause i just can't follow the rythm. SO that's it I just wanted to vant. Thanks
depression,I am sad. PLEASE help me.,"I'm sad. Please help me.

Backstory: my mom had me as a teenager. My biological dad and his parents all died (not sure whether this was before I was born or not). Mom married another dude and this man hates me.hes always hated me.i know it. My mom's whole family knows. Nothing could ever be done cos people had to protect my mother marriage.

Moved out at 23. We live on diff continents now. Still no relationship but they reached out to reconnect and hopefully help since I live in a country alone w no support system. Their families are in my city but they hate me for not getting pregnant young cos that's all they know and who do I think I am to escape that. So no relationship w them.

Turns out my mom didn't send her husband to reach out cos they wanted to help. They wanted to keep tabs on me to see how much I was failing since the pandemic has destroyed the 2 industries where I make a living. They wanted to gloat at how much I am a failure because I should've listened to them and rejected my dreams and opted to do life their way. Be in corporate and get a husband. Turns out my getting a husband was their only future plan for me.

Anyways: while working to make ends meet, my landlord had an affair and was kicked out of his house and I was evicted cos he needed to stay in my apartment. I packed my belongings into storage cos I've had a really tough year. I've had accident after another w broken bones, nursing myself back to health so I haven't worked this year as I was bed ridden. When I healed, I had to move. Flew across the world to visit my parents as my baby bro invited me for his graduation. I knew this was a bad idea but I'll do anything for my bro. The idea got worse cos now I'm no longer just a kid my mom's husband can abuse, now I can stand up for myself. My mom can't ever defend me, she has nothing. Standing up for me will leave her homeless cos she gave up her career to build his and today she's just broke w nothing to show for it. 

I have had the greatest career in the past decade. I kick ass. I am amazing. And talented w awards to boot for all my incredible work. I worked hard to build myself a home. Security. Something my mother failed to give me all my life. A safe space. I have failed multiple times in my life but I have always gotten up to fight. But not this time. I don't know how to get back up. I'm broken. All I do is cry. I don't have any money. A friend put me up in their vacant apartment. I have lost my purpose. I feel like I've lost everything. I'm broken. I don't know how to get up. I can't look for work cos I can't sit up for 5min without tears. All I've done in the 5 weeks in this apartment is allowed myself to be sad, feel it and allow myself to work through it but I need money to feed myself. 

The positives: I've been absolutely stress free for the first time in my life. It's such a big deal all the inflammation in my body is gone. I no longer need nasal surgery, my endometriosis has subsided, no anxiety or panic attacks. 

I need to work but I'm not finding the reason to motivate myself. It's getting very dark and suicidal and I don't want it to get there. 

I feel like I gave my everything to build my life. Dropped the ball once by having an accident and now I've lost my home. If I can't build a home and give myself some security, what am I working for? What is the point.

Someone help me!"
depression,anti depression medication costly side effect on marriage,why is all the anti depression medication i had kill my libido. all with the advise of a doctor. it is choice of feeling much better at the expense of hurting my marriage i feel really bad for my wife she pretend its ok but i know better
depression,The more I look back the more I feel Like the person I am is empty inside,"Ever since I was a child, I bleed from social anxiety, emotions, introversion, stress, and other things I can't put into words. My parents always fought because of my father ( womanizer, drunkard, abusive ). I always left home and was at some place where I could be alone. I remember sitting at the top of a boulder believing that I'm the only person in this world, and all around me are mere illusions. It felt like everything faded, and my mind was leaving my body. Recently I graduated with a degree that  I don't even like. I became unemployed for months. I felt very useless. I don't have skills, no talents, I don't have the qualities, and I don't have the personalities employers want.. My depression intensifies, and it intensifies even more when problems trigger again. It is much worse than before. I cried lots, so much that my heart was about to explode. I want to live, but I don't know how to live anymore."

depression,Lost interest in everything,"Lately I've been feeling a lot of emotions. Got enrolled into university and I hate it. I go to classes and don't understand much, I wanna change it but I feel like it's a shame to do that. I feel like it's a shame I took a wrong decision. Going here makes me feel unmotivated, drained. I come home and cry for hours, this situation is also affecting my relationship. I try to hold my tears all day long. I feel weak, I feel like a failure. I've had this depression for such a long time and this university triggered it even more. I'm seriously thinking about taking a bunch of pills and end this. I'm a disappointment to everyone. I make people sad."
depression,God Won’t Help Me,"I have prayed and prayed for so long and people have prayed for me but god hasn’t helped me. I have cried out to him and nothing! Why doesn’t he help me? Why doesn’t he help people who are suffering; I don’t understand. If I was god and had all that power I wouldn’t let people suffer or be miserable or let all the evil in the world exist. No one in the world asked to be here, I know I didn’t ask to be here and don’t want to be! No one should suffer through life when no one asked for life in the first place. My mom could’ve had an abortion and that would’ve been fine."

depression,I just fucking hate everyone,"I want to hurt everybody that i see, myself included"
depression,I would trade places with someone who is going to die but doesn’t want to,When people who enjoy life die I feel bad because they actually wanted to be here unlike me. I hate life and I’m still living. I would trade places with someone who wants to live but is going to die in a heartbeat.
depression,I want to give up,[removed]
depression,The apathy is terrifying,"I feel like a robot. Everything is falling apart but I can't care about it. It's as though depression is leaving no room for any emotion other than ""meh"". 

I've suffered depression since childhood but I have never before felt this level of apathy. What's different this time? What the hell is my brain gearing up for?"
depression,doubters,what do you tell people who say that depression isnt real?
depression,I finally accepted that I am completely alone,"I live alone, I work alone, I have no friends, but it never really clicked until last night that I really am alone. I'm introverted and I talk to myself and I spend a lot of time daydreaming so it's easy to ignore the loneliness for months at a time. I haven't even left my room in three days.

My family always wanted a normal son and never thought I could achieve anything in my life, but I am not normal and I will never live the life they want me to live and I refuse to give up on my dreams. So I moved as far away as possible as soon as possible and I only see them several times a year. I haven't achieved the life I want yet, but at least nobody's telling me what I can't do anymore.

There is nobody coming to help me, but there are plenty of people who will take advantage of me. I can't say how many times I've been screwed over in business and by friends. You can literally shake someone's hand and make a deal and the second they have to live up to their end, they betray you.

There will only ever be one person who will always be with me and that is myself so I may as well get used to my own company and try to help myself, because I can't be sure that anyone else will. There may be other people in my life, but I must always remember that I can't rely 100% on anyone. Friendships end, business people betray, lovers cheat.

It's a shame there isn't a way to know who you can trust, so I guess I just have to play the odds. I will always need people around me to work for, and eventually I will have to date and make friends in order to live the life I want. If I replace everyone I can't trust, eventually I'll have a network of people who are likely to be there for me, but I always need to remember that I'm the only one who will 100% be with me.

So I want to know how to be my own best friend first and do for myself what I would do for others. I can be a great friend to others, but I have difficulty helping myself because truthfully I don't like myself. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the rant."
depression,A nurse made me promise I wouldn’t kill myself today,"I recently went to the ER for self harm and had to call my primary doctor to set up an appointment for a medication change + talking about the whole ordeal at the hospital.

I contacted through a nurse first to explain what happened and see if I could get a earlier appointment than the one scheduled for two weeks from now. 

I have never met a nurse so personally worried for my well being. She talked to me on the phone and multiple times asked me not to kill or hurt myself before my appointment tomorrow morning. I kept reassuring her I wouldn’t.

I’m not uncomfortable with this at all, it was weirdly comforting. So, thank you to that nurse."

depression,Having a cold/flu and being depressed and anxious? Advice needed,"Hi all,

Recently I've been suffering with some mild COVID19 symptoms after testing positive last Thursday. I'm out of isolation tomorrow but over the last 3-4 days I would say that my mental health has taken a hit. I'm taking Escitalopram 10mg but was finding that was working well before my positive test for COVID. Over the last few days, I've been feeling down, anxious, restless, irritable, grumpy, you name it.  I also have little interest in doing things. It's almost like being ill has made my antidepressants stop working and I'm undergoing some kind of withdrawal. 

Does this feeling go away when I recover from this illness? I just feel so low at the moment, whereas I would say I felt pretty good before my test last Thursday."
depression,I just want to sleep,"Your life doesn’t matter when you’re asleep. The relaxation is a consistent euphoric oblivion. When i find myself waking in the morning, or often in the middle of the day/ early afternoon, all I want is fall back into my own little black world of peace. 

My dream is to live a life long dream, to sleep forever."

depression,Harsh truth,"Everyone wants to advice on things they never went through but never want to become part of solution.

depression,I'm stuck,"Everything sucks. It's a constant cycle of ""feel like shit"", ""start feeling better"", ""feel really great"", ""minor inconvenience (college)"", and start again. But it gets worse every time. I hate it here. And I don't know what to do. Or how to tell anyone this. Anyone real, that is. I love my friends. And I know that my one friend in particular has depression and has considered ending his life. And he's spoken to me about his feelings because he trusts me. But all I can say is, ""it gets better"" and ""I understand how you feel"" because that's all anyone ever tells me. But I feel like most of them don't understand how desperate and lost I am. Like fuck I know it gets better but then it gets worse. I don't know what to do anymore."
depression,Lost and Alone,"I am a newly 17 Aussie (WA). This year my life has gone to shit. School and then work dumped me because of mental health issues that don’t have a label and won’t ever be diagnosed because I can’t get to therapy.

I’ve applied for countless jobs, looked into TAFE courses, but with jobs I’m not qualified for anything and I can’t find a TAFE course I could actually finish.

I was supposed to finish a Cert III Animal Studies, but they kicked me out for a term and then dumped me in the dust when I was then falling behind. It’s still up in the air whether I will finish at all, not like I can get a job with it anyways.

My parents are done with me. They wasted so much money on me for me to turn out like a failure. They want me gone. My home life grows more unstable by the day.

They no longer want to support me and I have no money (because nobody will hire me, not even Maccas)

I don’t know what to do anymore. I can barely get myself out of bed most days.
My Type One Diabetes is out of control and I’m fat and in pain.

I don’t have anyone in my life, no friends, no family, nothing.

Is it even worth trying anymore?
Is there even anything to salvage?"
depression,I’m surly destined to be alone so I’m going to commit suicide tonight fully.,"Drinking a shit ton of alcohol does the trick Im going to commit suicide by hanging it’s over Im 19 I promised myself to see how it will get better within the future but it’s just gotten worse I don’t know anymore this is it I’m going to kill myself tomorrow by hanging or a cliff I know wrote and told my family and so on about this I’m just really done. I’m so alone just existing for the sake of it the loneliness is eating me up I can’t seem to look at myself and feel useful. I feel like this world has nothing for me. It’s like nothing is waiting for me in the future. I don’t want to survive this time I really don’t I rather best be dead and observe everyone live there life and be happy. I hate myself and never want to be alive again. Idk who will find this but thanks for being in my life. I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.
Goodbye.

Have to say thanks to the people who constantly reached out to me and on posts these couple of weeks it did seem like I was not taking it in but I sure did that’s why I was and am still here not anymore now."
depression,I dont know who I am,"I dont know what i like or what i dislike. nothing i do brings me joy like i say i enjoy reading but i dont actually feel anything when i read. Its just another thing I do that helps me forget about reality for a bit. I chose the subjects i study because i'm good at them, not because i enjoy them. My walls are pink not because its my favourite colour but because when the light hits them there's a warm hue in my room which makes me feel safe.

I dont know what I look like. Every time I look in the mirror I see someone else. Often I dont recognise the person in the mirror. I know my hair is washed out ginger and I have hazel eyes and my nose is pointy but those features dont feel like me. 
I know I'm taller than average but I feel small around some people. Some people make me look slim and others make me look fat. Who am I when I'm not comparing myself to others?

I always adopted traits from the people I surrounded myself with and that kind of gave me a sense of identity but now that i'm all alone i have nothing. who am i when i'm not being perceived by others?"
depression,At my wits end," I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a 26F, struggling with depression, anxiety and depersonalisation. I don't feel like there's any point of me carrying on anymore. Everything is so mundane and hard. I don't have a job because the thought of it cripples me. I rarely leave my house, other than walking my dog once a day, I haven't seen my family in over 2 months. I stay in bed until midday and some days can't even get out of bed at all. Nothing excites me or interests me, I just have no reason to keep going with this I can't believe I have another 60 odd years of this I already feel like I'm done. I've been on Trintellix 5mg for 2 weeks and all it's done is increase my anxiety. I don't even know what I'm looking for posting this, maybe it's just my way of ranting or hopefully someone can relate. I just needed to write it out as I don't really have anyone to tell this to"

depression,I have failed my theoric driving exam for the 6th time. I should give up shouldn’t I?,"So, I don’t know where to start. All my life I have passed my exams, heck I even speak 3 languages but, this time I think I may have to give up. I have tried to do my driving exam (theory one not practical) and fail every time, 3 times failed with 4 mistakes. I can’t continue to do this. I have even questioned whether I’m actually dumb or what’s the case, it’s my 6th time!!! I can’t pass it I have tried everything study by myself study in classes studied online read books. I think I’m gonna give up, what’s the point?? Any advice? What would you do? Has this happened to you or is it not normal?? Because All people I know have passed the exam the first time. is something wrong with me?"
depression,How to feel better if you don't?,"Sometimes I feel trapped because I don't know how to make myself feel better. Somehow it seems if you want to feel good then you already must feel that way a little bit. I don't know if that makes sense. Instead you get stuck in this cycle of not wanting to do anything you think would help you and feeling worse for it.

I keep thinking and thinking. Wondering how I can solve these problems of mine.

It hurts to think of all the people going by in their sadness and their pain. And it's something so hard to put into words. Even if there are people that don't understand, maybe there are just some people that do."
depression,I feel like I’m falling into a depression and idk how to handle it,"I think i might be falling into a depression and I have no idea what to do. I feel like I don’t want to do shit, I feel like I’m sad or worried all the time, getting insecure and everything, even though objectively I have a good life. I’m only 20, have a wonderful gf, we moved in together earlier this year etc. so basically everything is fine. But idk, something doesn’t feel right. It’s probably my own fault but yeah… everyone got their package ones gotta carry, right?"
depression,I have failed almost in everything.,"Today I (22 F) got bad news again, I failed my theory driving test for the 6th time which is not normal considering I have heard all people saying “I passed the first time! So easy”. I have failed the year in Uni, meaning I either have to repeat another year or completely give up Uni which is what I think is the best option considering I fail at almost everything. I don’t know when this bad luck started but I have done so many mistakes the past years I feel like a failure. I don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I wish I could just live by myself and disappear from my parents and from the world but I can’t because I have social anxiety. I feel horrible. I can’t get a job because I have social anxiety, and I have gone to the therapist but nothing works, and I just feel like a burden. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I think I never will."
depression,Am I depressed?,"I sleep a lot on my days off. There are many things happening in my life. I’m confused. 

Everyday I convince myself that I’m lucky I have a good job and I make decent money to afford my house and other expenses. 

I live alone. My parents are gone. My family (brother, sister, nieces, and nephews) contacts me from overseas to ask for money. I send some when I can. They sometimes make me feel guilty if I don’t send any. 

I grew up poor. My family never helped me. I moved to another country to better myself. 

I have family here but I don’t talk to them. 

I feel alone but I tell myself that I have managed to live alone for many years already. I gamble at the casino when I feel lonely. I max out my credit cards and then feel depressed after that and then I go back to work overtime to pay my credit cards and then gamble again. 

When I’m home with mo cash to gamble, I sleep a lot. I just eat and sleep and then wake up to go work. 

I’m a good worker and I do my job really well. Matter of fact, I’m the most reliable employee. I don’t bring my personal feelings at work. I’m lively and productive at work. 

I don’t make friends with my coworkers though. I just work and clock out and go on with my own personal life after work. 

At home, that’s when depression hits. I don’t wanna go see a professional coz I know they’ll give me some meds and I don’t wanna do that. I can handle this myself. 

I tried distracting myself by enrolling into a grad program. Halfway through the program, I quit. I think it made my anxiety worst. I can finish school pretty good but the pressure of turning in assignments and projects was a little too much for me. 

I don’t really need to do that kind of schooling. I can just go online and learn things at my own pace. I feel like grad school is just another money making scheme.

depression,how do I stay afloat financially?,I am 20 and have been going through depression for about a year now. My current apartment lease ends mid January and I need a new apartment to live in after. Problem is I'm running low on funds because I can barely find the energy to go make money. I could probably live with my dad for a month if I had to but after that it would be the streets.  I currently am self employed and resell college textbooks as well as collectibles and occasionally fix up a motorcycle and sell it.  I dont know I'm just looking for some advice I guess on how to support myself while dealing with depression.  I just want to get to a point where I can provide for myself well enough so that I can focus on beating my depression I dont need to thrive. Right now I just want to make enough to live.

I only know it happens on people with anxiety but I’m not (or at least I think so). It’s really annoying because it’s like being depressed isn’t enough and now I have to constantly control myself to not puke randomly too. Ugh.

I’m in my early twenties and have a toddler. I always wanted to be a mom. But now I’m so bitter and depressed all the time. My anxiety is through the roof most days. I have hyperthyroidism which can cause anxiety so my dr told me they wouldn’t prescribe any anxiety meds until my thyroid levels were okay. Months later and they’re the same I still have no medication to help my mental health. I feel hopeless like no one understands me or takes me seriously. I feel like I’m failing  all around.

One of the biggest reasons I do not want to get on meds is because of this, which might sound crazy or shallow but I genuinely would rather be sad and still have that intimate part of my life. Have you found medications that don’t do this? Or if you are dealing with this, how are you dealing with it?"
depression,Is it my medication?,"I've been on Sertraline (Zoloft) for over a year and recently was put up to 100mg. The entire time on Sertraline I've had points where I've felt awful. I'm a student and currently it takes everything not to fall asleep in lectures, I cant take notes because I can't concentrate and it leads to a buildup and having to go back after, which is a pain but not a big deal.
I think it's only been a recent thing, I remember struggling but not that bad. I've also had horrible anxiety for a few weeks. I woke up this morning with panic, and that depression thing of not being able to get out of bed. I also feel sick before going to certain places. I came home this morning from classes because I felt so rough and just collapsed and felt so down and went back to staring at the wall like I did when I woke up.
It feels like something my medication should be making better? Somehow I still have this intense anxiety and just total ambivalence. I have no interest in listening to lectures, and get really restless and start staring out the window.

When I started taking antidepressants I no longer have those negative feelings as well. If my whole family died now, I wouldn't feel anything. I think it's the antidepressants' fault - emotional blunting. People with PSSD have this.

depression,Don’t see myself in the future.,"So I’m my first year in college and I don’t enjoy college at all. I think it’s because I commute and go to a branch of the school where it honestly is dead inside and feels like a office place. I just don’t know what I want in life and I’m so unmotivated to do anything because o don’t know what I want. I honestly feel like I have already accomplished everything in life and I don’t need anything else and I can just die now. My parents tell me that you have a future ahead of you but I honestly don’t see a future without them. I think it doesn’t help that college doesn’t help with me going to each of their houses. Because I used to be a routine to go to each other’s house and I liked that routine but now I don’t like it because college ruined it. I really don’t like how college is. Maybe i should have been more prepared for college when I was in high school. Maybe I was so blind all this time when being in high school and not caring about my future and letting come to me. But I’m just so unmotivated to do anything because I don’t see a happy future because everyone makes living sound so miserable,and soon my only close people will be moving on like my sister and parents will be getting older.

They have never helped me and they probably never will. 

I didn't quit it because I feel better, I quit it because I don't. It has never helped me and I don't know why but I'm tired of taking it. I have tried literally everything.

depression,Do I sleep more because my antidepressants started working?,"I (22F) have been dealing with depression on and off for about 5 years. But the last 6 months have been an absolute hell, so I was prescribed antidepressants.

The first type I got didn't make things better or even worse. So 3 weeks ago I started on another type. I was sceptical and started to think after 2 weeks that it just didn't work for me. 

The overthinking and breakdowns made the nights a very unsafe environment for me. And even if I could get to sleep I was tarnished with extreme nightmares. Often I laid awake feeling absolutely horrible about my existence.

But now after 3 weeks on the meds I am tired af. I could sleep an entire 14 hours a night, wake up and go back for a nap a few hours later. Not because I am trying to escape my thoughts or existence, but just because I am tired and sleepy. 

Would is that? Is it because of the meds? Is my brain recovering from months of battle with itself? Will it stay like this or go away? I don't understand... 

Does anyone have any experience with this? I'd like to hear about it! 

Thank you for reading, lots of love!"
depression,i don't dream or want anything anymore,"Title says it all. 
I once used to be a very ambitious person, even accomplishing things at a young age, before any of my peers. For example, i hitchhiked around the world alone by myself at 18. I was super super proud of that too!
And i really wanted to go on like this, but my depressions really took a toll over the years. 
I am now 25 but i have wasted about all that time once i accomplished that traveling thing at 18. 

After that very happy 18th year, things started to go down for me. I continued hitchhiking, but got absolutely tired of people always asking the same questions, such as, ""are you not scared of hitchhiking? "" ""Is it safe?""etc. I started to get really angry about getting the same conversation for the millionth time that it was becoming hard for me to enjoy the hitchhikes and the travels. 

Travels are the same. Everyone always asks ""where are you from?"" and when i tell them where i am from, it is the same ""ooh i have been to this place in your country"" or ""ooh i like X food from your country"" and it makes me so angry to hear the same shit over and over and having to be nice and cortious to these people, who are giving me a ride. But really can humanity be this stupid? Why is everyone always saying the same thing as if they agreed on it in a secret pact all together without me knowing? People giving the same response over and over makes me want to stop their car immediately and get the fuck out without thinking about what has to follow afterwards or beat them up and tell them to shut up. 

Perhaps i have anger issues. I do work on it, but i dont like the concept of punching pillows, i actually do mean to punch people. But i know it is morally wrong, and hence my depression. Make it make sense, i can't. I just chose to be stuck to bed all alone because i would rather keep myself inside my room all day without getting triggered by people and not be able to express my true emotion, which is anger.

I absolutely hate people in general now. They are loud and simple minded and selfish. What i described in the previous paragraphs about hitchhiking boring conversations was only one example. I don't find the energy to always talk with them and even finish conversations, and they take my silence of exhaustion as a ""win for themselves"". That they were right. Most of the time, unless you tell them straight, they don't even notice they are being annoying or too much to deal with. And when you tell them, they can't deal with it. I tried telling people i wanted to stop talking with them because i was bored or i didn't have time for their stuff, they made me regret saying that out loud, with more of their stupidity. Like ""how can you say such things?"" and ""you are rude"" etc. Dude, i literally wanted you to shut up, that's why i said it, but now you are talking even more... I hate that people are always only invested in their perspective, their emotions without trying to prioritize you too. 

Everything that requires human conversation, everything that requires some kind of human interaction, i hate it. I only do it sometimes because i have to. But men it is so hard to fake those relationships, for even years at an end. Imagine i want to work in a job, or have a relationship and that requires years and years of human contact. I cant even endure 1 hour of social time at times. Just yesterday, i had to attend a 5 min conversation on the phone, and it made me so sick that i had to take like 24 hours alone in my room. I am getting shocked by facts as i am writing them. 

I even hate nice reasonable people too now, because when they are so nice to me, i wanna be nice back, but lack the energy + feel bad about myself for that. So they remind me that i hate myself and i hate them for it. 

Please no hate on me just because i said i hate people and cant stand them. I wouldn't choose this if i had to. I am merely expressing how i feel. 

Everything i have to do requires some kind of human interaction. I considered going to live in the wild and not seeing anyone, but i dont wanna do that either because that's not what i meant for myself. I want to live among humans, but like a god. Untouchable, able to fly, able to be visible etc. Yes, these superpowers would be quite cool. 

And please dont tell me to not care about what other peoples opinions too. I used to a child and was super judgmental towards many people, and when i was judging them, i just wanted them to answer to me with their own explanation. So i believe in giving everyone an explanation, no matter if they are rude or kind, but not everyone is also approving you for the story you have and are just mean for the sake of being mean, and i absolutely hate that. I hate that when you spare the time and the energy to explain something to someone and they just flat out are rude. It makes me wanna kill them to be honest, and i cant deal with the anger, and really feel like an imposter for punching pillows as anger management. 

I hate asking people for help too. It took me a long time to consider writing this post. Even as i did, i am not sure if it made sense because it is chaotic. I hate that when i ask people for help, they just come with generic responses like 

Like, like. I actually want a parent. This is not me being ridiculous, i know i am ridiculous, hence i wanna kill myself, bit like. I really cant carry myself anymore and really would do with a parent. I cant do with advice, i cant do with a go to therapy shit. I hate therapy. My own therapist despised me and he can go to hell. My own parents were terrible and remind me in every conversation my past traumas. I really want someone to hold my hand and rise me up and not expect anything in return. For everyone thats supporting me, i feel absolutely terrible when i dont say ""thanks 🥺 that advice made me feel amazing"" because again, that's lying and only makes me feel worse about myself. 

At this point i only didn't just kill myself because of my sister but honestly she is completely ignoring me and my situation. She is depressed herself. To be honest my depression came to be stronger because i was doing this whole ""support your depressed family"" thing to her and told her I'd support her. She has been ignoring my advice to get therapy for 2 years and that's ruining me. I fell to the same pit."

depression,Hard to stay positive,"Hello, I’m 33 years old and have been suffering from depression in varying degrees of intensity since I was a teenager. Ten years ago, just about, I took a bunch of pills and tried to end things. I’m glad I told someone and things didn’t end there but I’m still feeling a lot of the same feelings, just maybe not with the same intensity. 

I don’t want to end my life anymore, but I want it to improve. I want every day not to feel like a struggle. I suffer from pretty extreme social anxiety and despite my best efforts it has sabotaged my life in more ways than I’d like to admit. No one understands it either, I can explain away and people will just call me lazy and unmotivated and unwilling to change. No one can see the steps I’ve made to overcome it, because to most people those steps are just everyday things. 

Anyway, why I’m depressed…I’ve been working the same dead end low wage job for a decade, again my social anxiety has stopped me from pursuing something more substantial, I still live with my parents as well and the pressure of that weighs me down daily. I have no friends, I’ve isolated myself to the point where any friends I had made have all gone away, despite my best efforts. I am married and that is a plus, but I feel like I’m ruining my husbands life and bringing him down with me. 

Every day is a struggle, I work full time and my job leaves me exhausted and barely able to muster up to the mental or physical energy to do anything, let alone enjoy any of my hobbies or activities I do to keep my mind occupied. It just feels like a constant cycle of work, sleep, weekend, barely recover, rinse and repeat.

I’m writing this on a short break so I hope it’s coherent. I hope i didn’t break any rules. Just wanted to vent some things out as I’m feeling particularly down today."
depression,I feel uncomfortable all the time,"I have never felt like this. I constantly feel like I'm about take off from where I am. I feel like this isn't my place, like there isn't enough room for my own body inside my own skin. I can't settle anywhere, I can't find my home. It's overwhelming me, I hear white noise in my head instead of coherent thoughts."
depression,"October, 25, 2022","
Just feel so alone. I want to be held i want to be loved. Everything just feels so hopeless. I felt more anxiety trying to sleep last night than J have ever felt before. I wish people would reach it and just talk to me. not to fix anything just talk. I just miss Hope, She never asked me anything about myself like she never cared. Then told me I didn't care and I was boring and other things. I drive her everywhere i offer to bring her food at work I was doing what i knew to do. I'm not experienced in relationships. But if she felt like she was not wanted she should have told me. I loved her i would have done anything. She just expected everything to fall in line. She never tried to understand me she never ask any questions or tried to talk to me to understand. I would ask her how her day was and she would say busy. Then i would ask aren't you going to ask me how my day was? She would say i assume you would just tell me. She never asked do it seemed like she never cared. and i told her how it makes me feel but she would always write off my worries. ""Oh I assume you would tell me."" ""Its not a big deal"" It was to me. She didn't care how it felt to me. She even told me one night when drunk she didt care about me. I waited 23 years for a relationship and i just feel devistated. Love is unconditional, love is asking how someone's day was even if it was boring. I just want someone to care enough to understand me. Or at least try to understand. I would tell her my day and she would say nothing in response every single time. I told her everything and it still didn't matter. I loved her flaws and all. And there were a shit ton of flaws.

Preferiría haber muerto antes que estar así.,"Ya no se si mis sentimientos son reales o no. Me borraron varias cuentas donde pude exponer mis sentimientos reales asi que.....a la mierda esto.

Solo ya me siento vivo cuando sangro, estoy enfermo o directamente odio a alguien.

Siento que he perdido por completo la felicidad y mi empatia se agota cada dia mas.

No tengo ni ganas de escribir esta mierda, pero la escribo para que me deje en paz toda esta maldita basura. 

No se ya ni como hablar, ni que decir. Solo quiero ser feliz y volver a como era antes.

depression,Drank alone and cried laying down on the floor,"Last night, I drank a lot of rum and cried heavily. I decided to stop crying a couple of weeks back but as soon as I took the second sip, I started bawling. I rolled around on the floor of my living room and had a full blown panic attack. I'm not in the right mind but I can't rely on others. I need to help myself. There's no one for me. I wake up, work, clean, cook, shop, and sleep all alone. I hate everyone now. I fucking hate everybody.

On the outside, I might look like someone who has figured everything out in life but I am one sip away from complete breakdown. I'm not strong enough to hide my feelings anymore. I used to be able to do this easily during my teenage years. I need a break. I haven't taken a break in years. I eat whatever I cook but I have lost weight fast this year without effort. I don't hate my lifestyle but doing this long term was bound to come with challenges. I've been depressed for more than a decade easily but being alone makes me less angry."
depression,A problem for years...,"It's been a while since I resumed my treatment for depression, but I no longer know how clear my diagnosis is and that overwhelms me a lot.  I'm only with my psychiatrist, who is wonderful, but the psychologist that I had, I feel that she forced me to think things that she believed about me and in the end I left her.  I am currently taking fluxetine and lamotrigine, 2 of each, and clonazepam at night.  I don't feel like myself, anxiety attacks me strongly and I wonder a lot if it could be that the final diagnosis is not depression... my psychiatrist evaluates me in each session, now he wants to know if I have features of the autism spectrum. ..and I feel very strange, I feel too much energy and also that I cannot release my emotions, it is as if I have become a robot and I am on autopilot, fulfilling everything but without realizing it.

My memory is working like shit, i cannot remember things that i did like a few minutes ago...at night i have struggles to sleep and the clonazepam dosis isn't working well...im really tired..."

depression,weird med affects on dreams,"My whole life, I've never had dreams (at least not ones I can recall). The only times in my life I do get dreams is when I have a fever of above 101 and they are fucking terrifying (theyre these weird conceptual geometric things where the world shrinks/grows around you, time keeps marching on, and youre just stuck) (it doesnt sound scary but I've literally woke up screaming from them).

Anyways, since I was put on prozac, about three months ago, I have had dreams every fucking night. I literally do not understand how people live like this, having dreams and shit.
It's absolutely awful and I don't know what tp do about it. I know I dont like the dreams, and sometimes I'll wake up crying, but I can't even tell if they would be classified as nightmares, because they're nothing like the nightmares I tend to get. (for example, the past few have been my mother was a murderous excorcist, my house was invaded by squirrells, my grandma showed up and I was bit by a turtle, an entire history of mass genocide in a nonexistent country) I genuinely cant tell if they are nightmares and I have an actual issue to work through here, or if they are normal dreams and I'm just not acclimated
Every morning, I wake up utterly exhausyed from having had a dream, and I can rarely even fall asleep anymire wothout passing put from exhaustion.
Any advice for what I should do?
Or maybe any tips that could reduce dreams, help sleep, that sort of thing
any help is appreciated &lt;3"

I have 2 weeks off sick from work but my boss keeps hounding me about when I'll be back. I can physically feel my anxiety in my head - not a headache as such, but just pressure in the front of my skull. I hate this. All I want to do is sleep but I have a pet that's dependent on me. It's so rough. Why was I not good enough for this person? Why can't I be better looking. I think they have also muted me on social media, which I don't understand because I haven't spoken to them since they called it off a week ago"

And tbh i feel like my life is already shit and i dont see my self dying by natural causes and im very confident that if i dont change something with my life i will end up killing myself in the future.

I just want to be happy again the main reason why im sad and depressed is bc how lonely i am. I have like 2 friends that im not even that close to. I just want someone i can go to after a rough day and pat me on the back and tell me everything will be ok. But no my social skills fucking suck and idk how to fix it.
And my antidepressants stopped working. I went to a hospital for 6 hours over that shit i had to piss in a cup and get my blood drawn just for them to say no we cant prescribe medicine. Idk"

depression,Depression room help!,"First post on here
So today I decided to get up and clean my depression room. With a positive mindset I started cleaning, took a break, then went back. Long story short I came back and starting removing some old food and saw some maggots. Wasn’t like hundreds of them, maybe like 30. That was the first time I had ever seen something like this in my room so I disposed of them ( searched on Google how) and cleaned up after. 
 Even though my room is clean, my closet is a whole nother story. I know I have some old food in there along with ( not proud ) very very dirty pieces of clothes. It’s a horror in there and I don’t even want to check if there’s maggots.

I was wondering if there’s some sort of cleaning service I can get to clean my closet out ( people similar to the hoarder shows cleaners ). Because I feel deeply ashamed of this and really don’t want to ask for help from my mother. Not that she would even help if I asked her."
depression,I want to die without my body destroyed,"You know, pills or something like that. It would be horrible thing for my parents to see me hanged or splashed in the pavement. It's the only reason. But drugs like sleeping pills are not easy to get so I don't know what to do."
depression,TW : Self harm - attention or something more,"Do you keep it a secret? Or do you make it obvious and use it as a way to communicate that you’re struggling to your loved ones? 


Long story short : I have dabbled in self harm over the years usually burning because I am very conscious of not wanting it to be obvious and I find burns are the easiest to give excuses for. 

When I reflect on the times I have burnt myself I wonder at the reasons I did. I tend to think SH as a release - the pain distracts and cuts through the heightened emotions I am usually feeling at the time and gives me clarity and calm. Kind of like the shock of cold water to wake you up when drowsy, the shock of pain and associated adrenaline seems to “burn” out everything else. 

I know some people do it for punishment or because they feel they deserve it or for many other reasons but usually I do it for the sensation and the accompanied calm. 

I have recently started taking some pills - not in a “self harm” way (although I acknowledge it probably still counts) but I do it for the same purpose of overpowering the other feelings I am experiencing. 

Both the physical SH and the pills is something that I hide because I fear the judgement and misunderstanding that will come with telling anyone. I am not doing it for their attention or acknowledgement but rather to get some relief from “noise” in my brain (aka emotions and thoughts) 

Does this make it worse/more dangerous?"
depression,"I used to post here a lot, then everything improved, and 5 year later I'm back.","I was extremely depressed. I would spend my time alone writing in my journal, filling many pages a night expressing my feelings. I'd fill up entire books and then light them on fire, tear them apart, or drown them for a cathartic release.

I would make posts on here explaining how I felt, and how lost I was.

Then I met someone who changed my life. A mother of 2 who I immediately felt comfortable with. Things progressed and eventually she moved in with me. Her oldest was 6 and the youngest just 1 yr old.

I was scared. I wasn't sure if I could handle it. I didn't have any kids of my own, I never had even held a child. But their mother made me so happy, and immediately took my depression away. It's like when we met, my lows elevated to just normal 'bad days'. It was like magic. I loved her immediately for that.

I have my own problems from past traumas, and I'm not a perfect partner by any means. But I decided I was going to go all in on being the best partner and co-parent I could. For 3 years, every decision I made and nearly every thought I would have was based around the question ""Is this good for my partner or is it good for the children long term?""

I devoted my life to them. I potty trained the youngest. I taught the oldest how to read, study, and do math.

I have a loving family, but until this point I had never come close to feeling the kind of love I felt for these children.

The youngest gave me a little pink bracelet of stars when she was around 4 yrs old. I've worn it every moment of every day since, as a reminder of what I'm working hard for.

This was my primary focus for 5 years. 

About a month ago, I found out that my partner was cheating on me. I confronted her about it and her response was to tell me how she was unhappy with me and then she took her kids and left. I haven't seen them since.

One morning I'm waking up playing with kids, goofing around and having fun with them, and the next night I'm sitting in my home alone and knowing that I'm never going to see them ever again. 

5 years or finally being happy. I would wake up every day feeling so grateful that the deep emptiness I once felt was gone. So glad to finally feel like I had a purpose and to finally feel pure happiness.

For nearly 10 years prior to meeting my ex, I spent almost every night writing about how unhappy I was. Almost every night going over the pros and cons of just ending my life.


And I've forgotten all of those feelings. And it's all come rushing back to me, and ontop of it all, I've lost the people that I have loved the most in my entire life.

I will never see 'my daughters' next birthday, let alone the day she graduates. I will never get to see 'my sons' first sports game or help him build his first computer.

This life is so unbearably cruel.

I am so scared of the future. Everything was so much harder before. And now I'm back to square one but with the additional weight of having lost everything I had devoted my life to.

Every night I'm alone and no matter how bad I feel, there is no one to comfort me. I'm in so much pain."
depression,Trapped in a cage,"I’m currently 19, have no way of working and living at home with my parents and sisters.
Mom is verbally abusive. Dad is as well but he mainly doesn’t give a shit these days.
My mom is unbearable to live with. She’s telling me I should starve myself and constantly making threats. The only reason I’m here is cause of my sisters. They’re my only reason for living. I hate myself so much and I wish my mom would love me like a mother should. I know there’s no point sulking about it cause she has narcissistic tendencies. I just wish things were different."
depression,I am afraid my mindset is keeping me from making progress. Do I get depression wrong?,"Hello guys
It would mean the world if you could offer me some advice regarding my mindset or sharing some personal experience.

I (F28) am diagnosed with depression for ten years and with BPD for seven years.
The BPD is pretty much under control by now (thank god!!) but the depression isn’t.
I am not sure it was like this over those ten years that I’ve battling with depression, but for at least half, I feel insanely tired.

This is important, I promise.

Over the last years, I probably didn’t have one month, adding up, that I felt energized, enthusiastic about anything for more than five minutes or just plain normal.

It’s hard to shower, to brush my teeth, to get out of bed, to go outside, to talk to people. It’s hard to do everything, even things I like.

I am taking my meds and seeing my psychiatrist regularly. I also do therapy.

My doctor is super nice and I don’t plan to switch, it took me forever to find a good match. But once in a while, she says things that make me question everything.

I will give some examples:
She says I need routine to get better. But this makes me wanna cry in frustration, because I can’t do it. The way I see it, it’s the other way around. As soon as I feel better, routine will come back naturally. This is how it worked when I had ups over the last years.

She also says that if I don’t do something, it means I am boycotting myself.
Ok, sometimes. But always?
Is it so hard to believe I can’t do things ?

I don’t know. I am confused. I wanna cry.
Am I being lazy or am I really impaired? I feel so tired. I just wanna rest.

What if I am not doing enough to get better?
Is it my fault I am wasting my life? It breaks my heart. I loved so many things. I wanted to do so much."
depression,"Bruh, I just can’t","Just why? Why does it always come down to this? I take my meds, I socialize, I call my siblings, I hand out in person, I play games with friends. And yet, it always ends with me feeling alone, suicidal, isolated, not needed, not wanted, out of energy, and ready to see what’s next. I just don’t know what to do anyMore.

I try really hard to keep everything a joke, keep it in perspective, focus on the good. Yet even when it feels good I’m just waiting for it to get bad again. Strangely when it gets bad is the only time I feel at ease, cause at least it won’t get worse.

I go to therapy, I manage meds with a shrink, and yet I always end up here. How many more times do I have to do this before I can finally call it quits and say I have it my best try?"

It’s like I can never do anything right. My life has so little ups but so many downs. I have nothing and no one to live for. In all honesty I think everyone would be better off without me.

depression,I'm no longer entertained,"I've probably posted the same sorta thing before lol but I don't really care. 

I can't find a single thing to entertain me anymore, and I've tried a lot of shit. Games are all the same and are no fun. I can still play them for hours but it almost feels like I'm on auto pilot and just passing time. 
All my hobbies are just dull at this point. I got into playing cards recently but that got old quickly because I have no one to play with. I'm tired of scrolling through the internet and only talking to people over the internet. The only hobby of mine that I actually stick with is working out, because I have a decent physique and I'd like to at least keep it like that or improve it a bit. 
I dunno, literally the only thing that entertains me is being with friends but outside of my friend group I feel so goddamn alone. I do not live close to any friends and it's rare that I get a chance to hang out, outside of school. 

I'm sure nobody read this lol. Either way I just needed to rant to something, and I didn't wanna burden my friends with my bs. Yeah ima go back to dying inside lol"

depression,Who can I trust?,"I learned I can’t even trust my wife. I have nobody to talk to or vent to anymore. I’ve been really struggling and having some bad thoughts lately.

I thought I could open up to my wife and tell her some of the dark thoughts I’ve had lately in terms of hurting myself and my father in law asked me if I was okay then felt the need to check up on me a couple days later, she claims she didn’t mention anything to him.

A couple of my family members felt the need to call me and ask if I was doing okay less than a week later, again she claims she didn’t say anything to them.

Her coworker even “wanted to talk to me” but she claims she didn’t say anything to her outside of saying “he’s stressed out”

I know it’s all bullshit

I know she’s been talking about the issues i have asked her to keep private. She knows I’m looking for help, I’ve asked her to keep my issues between us and to just let me find outside help on my own, I’ve asked her to not mention anything I say to anybody we know.

I’ve had to lie to family more in the past 2 weeks than I have in the past 30 years.

I’m tired of saying “no I’m fine just a little overwhelmed” or “yeah no I’m just a little stressed out with shit”

I can’t trust anybody anymore, I have nobody to talk to anymore. I can’t trust her anymore.

I feel so dead inside, I feel emotionless, I can’t even sleep.

I can’t even confide in my wife about shit I’m going through without everybody in our family knowing about it!

All it did is make things worse.

I was clinically diagnosed with PTSD and I don’t want to discuss it with everybody, I really don’t even want to talk about it but I trusted her. I can’t even do that now…

Ive felt like ive done everything ive wanted in my life. I just cant keep on going. I feel apathetic to everything. Im way to tired to do anything anymore. I just dont give a shit anymore. I don't enjoy none of my hobbies. The only good thing i have left are my friends. They are the only thing stopping me from ending it all, they are the only thin that genuinelymakes me laugh but only for a few hours, once they aren't there Im back to being tired. It feels like the end for me, can't see myself in the future being happy or even alive. School started again and I’ve been stressing out what I’m going to do with my fucking life. I dont know if i can keep up with my grades and I don't know if I can do this for another year or two. I just want this shit to end, I want to be happy, I want to rest. I hate this shit."

depression,My gf flirts with other people while being apathetic towards me. All while saying she's not good enough for me. Yet I still can't leave her.,"There are definitely reasons I am with her still. The times she's not apathetic she's outstandingly loving and makes me feel better than ever before.

But, the majority of the reason is that I don't think I'm good enough for anyone. So, the fact that I'm good enough for anyone, let alone someone as amazing as her makes me feel like I got unbelievably lucky and like I'll never get this luck again.

So, I continue with her. She ""unintentionally"" flirts with other guys even after I've mentioned it makes me feel shitty and I only express displeasure. She tells me she's unsure if she wants to commit any effort to the relationship and I ignore it. She says she's not sure if she has a desire to be with me and I ignore it still.

I've come to the conclusion that this is because I feel like I have no real attractive qualities and would end up with no one to embrace, left out in the cold, alone and sad if I left her."
depression,Empty,"I don’t think I can go for much longer. I drink and numb myself every day and go through the motions. When people talk to me at work I can see their mouths moving but nothing is computing in my head. I just smile and nod because that’s the easy thing to do. Drugs, therapists, I just don’t really see a light anymore. I’m not depressed, just empty. I’m going to keep trying, but I feel like I’m just prolonging the inevitable."
depression,am I the problem?,"I'm currently overthinking about all the problems that's happened in my friend group, it's all coming down on me and I don't know what to do. I keep going back and replaying memories in my head, thinking about what I did wrong. The main reason a problem starts is because I don't know how to talk to others, I've never really been able to be straight forward with something. There are times that somethingnis going on and i dont know what to say and i just stay quiet, or i want to say something but nothjng comes out.I try and try but it never works, I continue to blame my disability (aspergers) but I don't even know if it's that anymore. I'm slowly loosing my friend group and I don't want that, I want to try and distance myself but I'll only feel lonely. I want to talk and be serious with them about why I've been acting this way but the truth is I don't know myself, when I don't say anything they get mad and I apologize. I'm currently laying in my bed replaying every problem that's happened in the friend group, I've come to the conclusion that they all connect back to me, every single one. I'm listening to the voice in my head berate me saying that I don't deserve friends and I deserve nothing, maybe he's right.
I want to cry but the tears won't come. I want a hug but I can never ask. I want help but I'll only feel bad asking for it. I want to vent but the words don't come out.  I'm scared I'm on the verve of losing everything that made me whole.
Another thing is I'm making my girlfriend miserable. We've been together 2 years now and I've noticed I do the same with her, I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at relationships,  especially since one girl I was dating killed herself, she's ended up in a coma and forgot everything for a while. We still talk which is good, but I can't help but blame myself for it all, being as it I wasn't able to help or stop her, was I the reason she did it? Was I putting on alot of pressure? I don't know about anything anymore. 
I need to know, is it all my fault?
Do I have that bad of luck or is it just my poor decision making?"
depression,I’ve had enough,I can’t do this anymore. I beat depression and life stressors then they return. I want love then find someone new then it doesn’t go well. I worked hard.

depression,I am practicing death lol,"Ya sounds weird, either ur dead or alive.

I guess I am in the middle. Kind of overdosed on some meds. But I knew I will wake up. I am trying to figure out what dosage will totally knock me out for ever.

First time I tried , I slept straight 15hrs.

Second time 24hrs.


Hmm ... I definitely don't want to build tolerance.


I have to figure a dose that will be the end of me and peaceful sleep.

Waking up after 24hrs , just felt so good. Like I finally rested for a bit.


I wish I never wake up.

I am planning to end it during the holidays, that way, my family has holiday vacation to get organized,  mourne me and return back to life again in 2023.


Let them have a fresh start for 2023.  I am no use to them  now days.  I have helped them as much as I can.


Now ,, I feel like a burden . I am ready , I am tired of the hope, and tired of trying different ways to get better ,


You know what for some ppl it just does not get better.


Imagine a person who lost his leg, no matter what he does, his leg won't grow back. Or a person who lost there ability to see .

No transplant will let him see again. Nothing will bring back the sight.

Just like that nothing will fix my depression , no matter how hard I try , i cannot get better.

Same with the person  who lost their legs they cannot grow another leg, but they have to accept they don't have legs and learn to adapt and live a life without leg.


I guess being depressed,  kind of the same , learn to live with depression and do everything u can to function with depression.

Now days, becoming just impossible to function. I got a taste of nothingness and I want to go back.

Whatever rest I got from the nothingness felt good.

I want to stay there and thats its. I don't wsnt to exist  , I just want to be unborn , whatever that state is, I want to have never existed ."

depression,Another day where husband just stays in bed,"We'd been planning to take the kids to a pumpkin patch today. Everyone had been looking forward to it. Then my husband and I had a minor disagreement this morning (really, we were mildly annoyed with each other for about two minutes), and now he's staying in bed. He's not coming with us. The kids will still have fun I'm sure, but I don't know how to cope with this anymore sometimes. It's hard to talk to him about it because it will reinforce his belief that we'd all be better off without him. It's also hard just to keep it in because I know it will happen again and it just makes me sad and angry.
Not sure what I'm looking for. Some empathy I guess, and advice."
depression,What can I do for my depressed partner?,"My boyfriend and I are going through a very rough patch. Not because there's a lack of love but he hasn't been the same since months. First he was complaining about feeling burned out and stressed but I didn't take it that seriously at this time (ca. 3 months ago). Little did I know it would get way worse after that and his burnout would eventually turn into a really bad depression. Everyone handles their depression individually, I know. Unfortunately he feels most comfortable whenever he's alone and needs a lot of distance from people. But because I'm also carrying very heavy weights on my shoulders (family issues and my own depressive + anxiety episodes) it's very hard for me to understand that he's not pushing me away because he doesn't want to be with me. He told me several times that he's not capable of doing anything at the moment and that he can't meet my needs right now because he can barely meet his own. I understand that but at the same time I feel unloved and anxious. I miss the person he used to be and it pains me a lot. I often mistake his egoistic behaviour for one of his personality traits and forget that it's not actually him but rather his mental illness speaking. I really don't know what to do or how to help him. Everything I tried didn't really work out and we ended up being more frustrated with each other than before. We even talked about a possible break up but then decided to keep trying because our love for each other is not dead at all. I truly care for him and he cares for me. There's just something in his head that keeps blocking everything. We compromised and agreed that I should learn how to be more patient without giving him any pressure and he should at least try to get out of his cacoon from time to time to kind of ""nourish"" the relationship more with love and kindness. I think it's also very important to mention that I suffer from an anxious attachment style which makes distance even harder for me.

depression,im a whining loser,"all i do here is complain about having a good life but being depressed, if my depression is even real. 

i dont want to change. for some reason im content on being this bitching loser that cant do shit and leeches off my parents. 

im stuck in a spiral of self loathing and pity. its so pathetic but i dont do anything about it. ive evolved to the worst version of me. and i wont do anything because i dont care enough. 

im so selfish and entitled because my parents gave me a great life and did so much for me. i know im lucky to have people like them. 

im so fucking disgusting i hate myself for it so fucking much. i know i need to change but i know i wont so i should just fucking kill myself already."

depression,I’m getting better and I FUCKING hate that,"I still see no future, but I have suicidal thoughts less often. Suicide was the only option and now I don’t want it. There’s no future for me now. Only miserable existence. I want to feel bad. I want to feel awful so much. This way I could keep dropping my moods and all the shit on depression. This way I could cut myself without guilt. This way I could kill myself someday. FUCK I HATE THAT IM BETTER. I want to WANT TO kill myself. I want suicidal thoughts to come back. I want to go back to being miserable. It’s the only interesting thing about me. My depression. The fact that I am mentally ill. I want a relapse. I want to suffer. I want to finally be able to kill myself. At least try. I want my depression to be worse…"

depression,I want to scream more than ever,"I feel such a mix of defeated, sadness, frustration and confusion. My emotions vary from crying, stressed and general anger. Almost all directed at me.

Why can’t I just be more normal so maybe I can find someone to enjoy life with?"
depression,"Your Not Depressed, Your just living with the Wrong People","That's it , thats the fact that i learned today , all your life problems are real granted ! but the reaction of the people around you is the real deal , unsupported , unloving, family friends and every other chicken shit humans around you make you question you your own sanity, 

I strongly believe now depression is definitely situational and not chemical, 

You failed a test, not a big deal,
You lost a loved one, a healthy grieve,
Living in poverty, things don't remain the same always, your time will come,
An accident, a natural disaster , put any other suffering in this paragraph, 

These things make you human, its natural to be sad,

But the real deal , the most hurtful thing is not listed above and its the unsupportive , under appreciative , and unloved life , hurts the most .."

depression,“You can still leave”,"I was out with a depressed friend of mine and I made a joke about how she likes making fun of my dumbassery and she said “Well that’s something you have to tolerate if we’re friends. Better think twice about wether you want this. You can still leave.”

And I was a bit tipsy so my head was empty but I was still like wtf. I ended up laughing and saying “What? Where should I go?”

And she just said “You could leave and it’d be a sign that you don’t want to be friends anymore.”

I didn’t say anything to that and we just kept talking.
But now, the day after, I’m really bothered by this.

Is this how she always feels deep down? Is this something Depression makes you think? I really want to talk to her about it and assure her that I like having her in my life. Would it be okay to ask why tf she’d think I want to leave?

Edit: Later she said I had a good time and I said me too and she asked “was that sarcastic?”
Of course I said no, I like you and I had a good time but still. What is going on and how can I make it a little better, if at all?"
depression,The thought of dying is the only thing that gives me relief from this hell,Seriously it's like a cozy blanket that warms me up knowing I can break out of this meat suit anytime. The process of leaving is scary but the results are the most freeing experience. I look at like this death is coming no matter what why keep suffering if there's no fix and things keep getting worst prolong suffering is pointless.
depression,I wish I could just cope normally.,"Heyo everyone. I havent posted a lot so I am sorry if this is just gibberish and stupid

I find it so difficult to live my day to day life. I am medicated with 2 antidepressants and adderall for my adhd but I cant consistently take it (adderall) bc if i do, the withdrawals make me feel x10 worse and i know using it for extended periods of time will fuck up my brain. I am too scared to take it every day bc of how it will affect me in the long run. 

I wish i could just forget about all the trauma and pain and everything that makes me want to turn to substances but i cant. I feel like i was dealt such a shitty hand in life and when im drunk or high i dont have to think about that. i can just exist but at the same time i know how unhealthy it is. i am afraid that i will become the person that i hate and i would rather die than be that.

i know this is just rambling but i am drunk and so afraid that i will never get better. i wish i could just be normal. it is so hard."
depression,I don’t know who I am anymore,"Back in 2020 I (male) was living in a foreign country away from home (Australia) for about two years. When the pandemic hit we had to move back in a hurry. At that point I had just made real friends and people that I was growing really close to. I was in my first year of high school at that point. I moved back to Australia after not being able to go to school for a whole year and not having a real place to call home. Just moving between different houses until my family eventually found somewhere to settle down. Over the last two years I have been in several groups moved schools again and life could not have gone any worse for how I planned. Got into fights with others I had just met after a ton of racist hate in my first term of school. Kicked out and made fun of by my group. Eventually so bad I had to leave and go to a new school. 

I had what people call a glow up. I used to be on the bigger side and had terrible skin. I grew a ton and got my skin sorted out as well as worked out so I started to get a lot more attention. It started to get to my head the more fun I was having. However as I would get into a new group of mutual friends I had from my old school it became apparent to me that everyone had been friends for years and I just didn’t fit in at all. Subconsciously I started to change in my personality and the way I acted to be more liked, chasing friendship. This would result in my downfall because now I don’t know who I am. I’ve become a background character in everyone’s lives and don’t have any friends that would even consider me to be anywhere at 5th to 6th in their circle. The people I now value the most out of my friends just see me as another mate who’s just there. I don’t know who I’ve become now chasing other peoples approval and I hate the person I’ve become. 


How do I find my old self? 
tl:dr 
After moving countries chased friends and lost my own identity in the process."

depression,feeding myself,"I have gone weeks without going to the grocers. Live with mother and younger brother cause I can't afford rent. I don't even know how I'm alive honestly, it's been like this for so long but lately I don't even go to the store. I would like to cook and have food ready to eat for the week. The task of meal prep and planning is so daunting for some reason. Most of the time I cook my family ends up eating it, my living situation prevents me from having my own fridge space that others respect.

What do you all do to make sure you eat? What should I buy that is easy to make/freeze?"
depression,I know I'll never be loved like I love,"There'll always be something else, something in the way, something more interesting. I'll always be an afterthought fading away, at best.

And that realization destroys me.

Why live in a society if it's always gonna be everyone for themselves

Just do the humane thing and strike me down like a horse with a broken ankle"
depression,Why am I so oblivious as to why no one likes me?,"I seriously wish I was self-aware enough to recognize what people don't like so I could try to change it. I'm tired of being lonely, and wish I could have at least one close friend. But I'm starting to think that I'm just stuck.

It doesn't help that I'm inherently afraid of everyone. It's so hard to come out of my shell when I can't even think straight when talking to anyone. 

But I wasn't always like this. There was a time in my life where I was super outgoing and had no trouble making friends. But trauma, I think, fucked me up.

Can people sense my anxiety or am I just that fucking awful? That no one even wants to say hi to me?

I genuinely don't know if I should live anymore. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm already too far gone to ever make a life for myself. Could there be a day where I look forward to tomorrow? I couldn't think of a time in the past ten years where I went to bed not dreading waking up. Or maybe that is universal?"
depression,Coffee,"Ok dis is weird but coffee is like mdma to me.
I deliberately drink it at like 2 weeks from from my last drink, to maximise its strength. Then I have a strong black coffee, maybe two, and I feel alive as fuck. I’m usually melancholy, lonely, and very lazy (I’m ADD), and this shit makes me feel like a real person for a few hours. I recommend"

depression,Feeling down again,"Tired, lonely mentally drained. Feeling abandoned, isolated. Not suicidal, just don’t care for life. If I was to die in my sleep it wouldn’t be the worse for me, while in near death experience it doesn’t phase me. I can acknowledge that that was close but not enough to shy me away from it. I was driving the other day and thought about wrecking and I had no emotion towards it. When people talk most of the time I don’t feel anything. Lot of times I get angry asl, or sad. Not sure if that’s what one feel going thru depression, just had to get that out."

depression,Alright I’m done with living. Got nothing to look forward to anymore.,"I’m 19 and I don't know, I don't even know what to say here in all honesty. I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.
I’ve tried everything in person dating apps I get the numbers and then they just ghost me. I look around and see couples holding hands cuddling and so on and I just come back to my place alone and I’m  thinking of ending it soon not because of this just because this life is annoying."
depression,how real is my depression,"im 17. i have wonderful parents. i have zero childhood trauma. ive never dealt with the loss of a loved one. ive never been abused in any way. i was a high achiever at school. i wasnt too social but people liked me in highschool bc i was somewhat attractive. ive had people ask me out. my family is not rich but not poor. i live in a first world country. 

am i just going through an edgy teenager phase? i ended up dropping out of school and i became the family disappointment. i was supposed to do well and go to med school. make my parents proud. but now ive been diagnosed with clinical depression. i am suicidal. i am an utter failure in that regard. 

but seriously, my life is fucking amazing compared to others. do i even have the right to be depressed. am i just being spoilt? just so self centred and entitled and wallowing in selfpity like a pathetic loser."
depression,Discovered suicide victim,"On Friday after getting home from work I heard a loud bang and after a minute dark smoke towering over forest. I hopped in my car and drove down toward it because I was sure that some stupid kids were up to shenanigans and wanted to make sure no forest fire was starting there. 
Instead I found a car up in blaze. I watched it burn for a minute or two, took few pictures and drove off, trying to find reception to call fire services to come and put it out. 
Only to realize hours later there was a half burned corpse. Someone commited suicide with three gas cilinders in his car, laid down in his seat and lit a match (information I've heard from people talking and the employer of the said person who was called on the scene during a police investigation)

The explosion blew the doors off and pieces of the car were scattered in 70m radius. I was looking at his corpse laying there with his scull dangling, hand halfway out of the door. 

When i opened my car window I didnt smell anything. Not even burnt plastic, not even the nutorious smell of burning human flesh. Just nothing at all. 

Brain does wonders to protects us i guess. 
It took me a few hours to understand what I was. 
I'm a complete mess. 

Im just glad that it wasn't kids who discovered it."

depression,i need help with my attempt thoughts,"I’m freaking myself out over the possibility I didn’t actually attempt suicide. I genuinely can’t remember if I attempted or not and that makes me nervous. It was a long time ago and I know how I attempted but I can’t recall the memories of it. Is that normal? I know that I was depressed and have been for a while now and I know that suicide has crossed my mind a lot, but I can’t remember the night of. Only the fact that I attempted. But when I can’t remember details and there’s no proof, I can’t tell what’s happening. Was it a dream? Was it real? Is there any way to tell? I know that I’ve always told people I’ve attempted and I think I have but like was it all a dream? I don’t know why this is happening but I need help"
depression,Husband's depression feels like the end of us. Looking for some insight please,"My husband's depression has taken a toll on our marriage and I feel like I am in mourning. I have started seeing a therapist and he has medical help, but there is one particular thing that I want to get some advice/insight on from this subreddit.

In our three years of marriage, depression and anxiety has robbed us of most of our happy moments and barely allowed us to have a marriage. It's just been survival through a worsening depression. It has now become pretty bad where he barely gets out of bed unless it is to go to work. He is on medication and has a medical support system around him.

There is one thing I am struggling with the most. He can function, not well, but function when it comes to work, his family, friends etc. But when it comes to us, he can't seem to cope at all. He has barely been able to talk to me for 2 months now. Barely has his eyes open long enough to see me. I have reached a breaking point. I have found myself pleading with him to just say a few words to me, sit with me for a few minutes, just..... something. But he just keeps saying sorry.

I know he loves me. I know this is hard for him but it hurts to watch him be able to function with everyone else but not me. Please, has anyone else experienced this? I just want to understand and know if someone else has struggled more with their partner than in other relationships."
depression,Depressed and a potential drunkard (maybe?),"During my therapy when I was around 16, I was warned to not have any vices in the future if my depression would not go away.

After ten years, I gradually began drinking to feel physically, emotionally, and mentally heavier and eventually drowned myself to sleep.

I just started drinking last year when I could not afford to go to therapy and get the medications.

I hide this from everyone because I'm embarrassed that they'll judge me. Because those people who know me well know that I totally do not drink because of my beliefs.

I know this is my choice, but it's the easiest way to be numb and forgetful about everything for a moment until I fall asleep, so that I cannot overthink it until dawn.


And I'm honestly afraid."

depression,I can’t stand it!,"I’m having a really tough time at home. My family silence me and treat me like a burden. They have confirmed I’m a disappointment and should be more like others, like my sisters. If I let them know my feelings about something they will treat it like an argument and get stroppy, patronising and embarrass me by making the whole thing public to anyone else. 

IM. GOING. INSANE!

I feel helpless, constantly angry, hurting myself. Whenever I go out I know they are talking about me behind my back. Going for a walk is me ‘sneaking off somewhere suspicious’ and I’ve got to be back early, take my phone with me, let me know where ur going, etc. Im 21 (F) living in the safest town ever. Why the fuck do I need to be treated like this?! I feel controlled and shamed constantly. I feel like the lowest I’ve ever been. I have no friends to confide in so all these feelings build up to the point I feel crazy."

depression,Help,I need some help deciding what to do. Ever since I remember I've had issues with sleeping and constantly being tired. I have now come to realize I may have some form of anxiety and depression. I struggle to get myself to do anything but can usually force myself if I need to. I'm not particularly sad but I struggle to sleep and have enough energy to get through the day. That being said I do go to the gym daily but I find I need like 8-10 hours to function normally. Anything less and I'll be grumpy and somber the whole day and just want to sit in bed. I've told my doctor about this but they said they didn't know. I also believe my anxiety is the only thing that makes me actually do anything so I'm scared to take something for that and cancel it out and just be depressed. Is it all mental? What is depression really like? Any advice?
depression,Wish I was in love but I’m scared,"I just watch an anime called Ride Your Wave.

It was depressingly beautiful. Their love was so pure and I wished I had someone like that to love and be loved by. When they sing their song with their laughs, it just hurt right in the heart. You can hear their smiles. You can hear their love.

But the ending really broke me. I also don’t know if I’ll ever recover from losing someone if I ever loved them that much. I just want the love with no risk but unfortunately that is not real and that’s why I’m so scared to find any. But my heart yearns for that beautiful love and so far, I don’t think I’ll ever get it.

10/10 will recommend if you want ugly cries. Animation was too beautiful to not watch and the voice acting is just chef’s kiss."

depression,advice please- partners with depression,"Desperate for some insite if you are the one in the relationship who suffers depression.

My husband of 15 years is now the shell of the man I knew which is heartbreaking. I know it's not his fault. I don't blame him nor resent him. Yes I get very very angry at times however I'm human and he says hurtful things.

Wondering if after a depressive episode, once the fog lifts if you a remorseful for what you have said and done during the period? Does the numbness go and love return? 

Lastly, anything your partner did that specifically helped you even though you pushed them as far away as you can? I'm not giving up or going anywhere. He's staying with family during this time and I am giving as much space as I can.

Sorry for all the questions, I'm just at loss. I feel like all the hurt and pain he feels he feels must also put onto me.

How do I live when I wanted to die almost all my life? How do I keep living work eat sleep? Work eat sleep. Work eat sleep. Just alone. So alone I have a fucking imaginary friend. Pretty much schiz. But tells me to live. 

I'm really low. But too scared."
depression,why??? what did I do wrong???!!,"I (17M) am so frustrated, I am done with this. I can no longer take it. I have no friends, I have a bad relationship with my parents, I am all alone. People respect me and we can chat, but it's never like a friend, ALWAYS excluded when it comes to any events and things like that.

Why the fuck? I'd like to be able to express myself without using such lexis, but I can't. Why the fuck do I deserve this? What did I do wrong? What's the point of living for me?

I am supposed to find my thing to feel less lonely. I have hobbies and I am fairly decent in them, but who fucking cares? Nobody. I have nobody to show it to, I can only upload it to reddit and get some feedback here, but I end up hating my life even more, cause im good at the things that I do (as a lot of people say in my life - from relatives, to acquaintances), yet being friends with me is not an option, I guess?

Whats the problem? Why would you bother to tell me compliments and never even talk to me? That only makes it worse!

Why, oh why would I deserve it? Seriously, why lonely people are lonely? Is it always our fault? Im not being a d-head to people, I can talk to them and make them laugh sometimes, but nobody ever invites me out. Why does this work that way?????????!!!!!

I used to hate myself, but this hatred now sometimes extends onto other people (not literally, only in thoughts, though I bet people can feel it), which is absolutely not ok! I don't know how to prevent it, because with each passing day the frustration only grows!

Nothing makes me happy! Oh, Ive finally managed to do pull ups first time in my life? But with whom can I share my excitement? With nobody, so of course excitement and happiness turns into sadness. Its all the same all the time.

I frankly don't see any valid point to continue living like this. Maybe there are a couple hundred (maybe thousand) people who liked my work, but I can bet the'd be absolutely fine if they didn't see/hear it.

I am very very sorry for anyone who read this from start to finish. Its a pile of garbage, but I don't know where/how to express my feelings, so that's the only way for me right now."

depression,I basically have to trick people if I want anything even resembling so much as a conversation.,"I have to pretend to be interested in what there interested in. I have to find some clever way to drum up a topic of any kind. Of thing's I dislike, of thing's I hate. And even then, there's no promise that I'll get what I want, a little reciprocation. That would be nice. 

What am I even doing anymore? Looking for a friend? A relationship based entirely on lies? I don't know what to do anymore. I can't figure it out. I'm trying to hold on to what's left of my life but it's still falling apart, despite my best efforts. I can't find a solution."
depression,After 7 months of war I can’t take it anymore,"Honestly, I wasn’t doing alright before it either but now depression is so bad to the point where I can’t stand anything anymore. All my little plans, hopes and dreams, my entire life were destroyed in just a span of a second. I’m so tired. I’m tired of being treated like shit, purposefully and demonstratively ignored. I’m tired of people constantly looking down on me like they’re some higher sort creature. I’m tired of being made fun of all the time. I know nobody wants or cares about some immigrant, but I’ve never wanted to be here either. I can’t stand watching my beloved land being destroyed when I am completely powerless. I can’t do anything about it. Every second of existence is full of suffering, it’s unbearable. 

If this all doesn’t end soon, I will end it myself."
depression,I keep loosing,"In the last year, I have experienced many what I call ‘losses’, I’m not talking loss of people  but what I deem losing at things- essentially not being very good at things/ life and it is getting me down. Real down.

A year ago, my girlfriend broke up with me, fairly unexpected no real reason as to why, some vague notion of wanting to be on her own- which I interperate as not wanting to be with me. I wouldn’t feel so hideous about this but I can’t get any matches on dating apps to save my life (I’m a fairly decent looking male, nothing special but attractive enough).

Then the band I was in, the lead singer/ songwriter effectively kicked me out, saying I wasn’t a good enough player.
No warning of not playing well before just a straight cut. 

My car of three years then fails its MOT and is £3k to replace. A car which has been beset with problems since I first bought it.

Recently, my company has lost the contract I work on and advised us to find other means of employment/ jobs.

My motorbike which I bought to replace the car was nocked over causing £100 worth of damage, no number left by the hitter. I also lost my helmet, bought a new one for £250 and then the old helmet was returned back to me. Can’t sell on the old helmet.

I also play hockey and have been for five years, and I keep making hideous, goal conceding mistakes.


I feel like I’m losing in every aspect of my life and I don’t know how to get out of the loser mindset or change things. It has also lead me down a path of self analysis, I believe I am not very opinionated / assertive person and I think this is also hurting my relationships with my friends as I don’t tend to make very good conversation."
depression,Talking to the wrong people.,"I don't know if it's true or not, but I feel like I've been talking to the wrong people. Certain personal matters, that I won't divulge here, are something that I talk to very few people about. I have next to no one to talk about them with who has any understanding of the situation. But the people that I have to, well, I've always has the suspicion that they don't have my best interests at heart. They've been initially very kind and almost intrusively making contact with me, but as I am severly lacking in an outlet for this, I opened up to people more than I should of. I'm concerned that everything I'm saying to them is finding it's way to people who really don't like me. There are a lot of tells they're giving off that suggest they really don't sympathize, and there are many obvious differences in our lives that may be a conflict of interest. But I don't know what to make of it. Nonetheless, I'm really concerned of retaliation from these people, or at least an attempt to destroy my reputation among the in-crowd. It's a miserable situation to be in, but I just have to let it go. I wish I could bring light to a lot of things that I'm worried about, but it's a very difficult situation for me, where powerful people are able to write the narrative and I have no recourse to set things straight."
depression,Feel i just wasted 33yrs of my life. How do i move on?,"So far, there was a fighting spirit in me that helped me move along with hardships of life. That desire to someday throw big fat middle finger to all factors that made my life miserable was the only thing that got me moving forward until now. 

Now, that fighting spirit is gone. I am feeling that despite all my efforts, my hardships, mostly triggered from my past trauma, are coming back to me like psychological herpes outbreaks. 

The pain due to my current mental struggles and my acknowledgment of  powerlessness to fight it off for good is now eating myself away inside and out. Now i just feel like there is nothing i can do to overcome my depression, with no one to fully support me (think my family is sick and tired of me too), so i wonder if i should drop the ball.

While i admit I am too much of a pussy to actually end myself, but seeing how therapy and help no longer works. Taking meds is what i am considering next, but this puts my career in jeopardy, once documented, per nature of my work. 

I am sick of having lived in this constant pain cycle for good 30plusyears now. But  at the same tome, given i just wasted 30plus years trying to cope with them like a man, i do not know what to do anymore either."
depression,Somehow I find comfort knowing that I can end it all,"I can’t seem to see the brighter side of things. I’ve become more sensitive, more antisocial, more awkward, more anxiety-ridden and depressed… one little thing can make me spiral downward. Yesterday my significant other commented on why I’m so shy and I just felt embarrassed and started over analyzing on how everyone might think that way about me. I just laid in bed wanting to cry, thinking about why I’m the way I am. 

I started therapy this year but somehow I find more comfort in the idea of ending it all if things become overbearing. Just wanted to share what’s been on my mind."

depression,13yo and hopeless,"derealization is killing me

hi, im 13 years old autist
this is my first post so i dont really know how to format all of this, but anyway

i've had childhood trauma with my abusive and alcoholic dad for my entire life and cut contact with him january this year.

i am currently seeing a therapist but its not really helping

school is really killing me, i cant focus or feel anything, i cant study and im failing all of my classes already

recently i've gone into a depressive episode and i'm experiencing derealization daily.

it's terrifying because i dont wanna live the rest of my life going to work or school because theyre the reason i want to kill myself

but on the other hand i think about my mom who would probably commit suicide aswell if i did.

i am hopeless for my future and i have 0 options

does anyone have any advice or anything"
depression,Lonely and losing the point,"Hi All this will be a bit of a vent so apologize if this is too much to be posted.

I'm in a bit of a rut at the moment, I'm trans. I've had top surgery, on hormones, and am not even considering bottom surgery. I pass quite well to the point my work doesn't even know I'm trans.

My issue is I'm mentally stumped. I struggle to make and keep friends which makes me feel incredibly lonely. I literally do nothing but work and then sit at home (I now work from home full time which is even worse). I came out of a short relationship about 3 months ago however looking back they were only dating me because I was trans. 

My main \*Life goal\* at the moment is to get myself my own place and move out. But now I'm looking at it and realizing not only will that take me years but what will happen then? I'll have a house with bills and will be working 5 days a week. I'll still be lonely(If not more without my family), single, and plain miserable. My best and only friends are my dad and dogs and sooner or later I'll lose them too.

I feel like I've spent the last 5 years working towards the next big thing, but now I'm thinking what's the point of it all?

I've had therapy before and am very aware that I may need to go back. I think I'm posting this looking for friends, advice, or a way of changing my mindset, I'm not sure really.

I'm grateful for any and all advise"

depression,"hi guys, sorry for my english :(","I've been hating everything, I hate my physique, my guitar skills are getting worse and I don't want to give it up again, I'm letting myself down and I hate myself, I hate what I've become, I hate who I am.

I'm losing myself, I don't care about everything, life doesn't excite me like it used to, honestly I don't care if something happens to me, I'm constantly on the verge of collapse and every time I go out I hope that some car will end my life. I'm all alone, it sounds stupid but I literally do nothing, I just waste my grandmother's money by living in her house, I should go and start sleeping on the streets. I barely talk to my best friend and my parents or relatives don't understand me, it's business as usual, you're just pretending, you're too lazy, you're useless, etc. But it must be something else, right? It can't be that I'm living the worst moment of my life just because I'm lazy, I think I should just wait to die from something random because I'm too cowardly and useless to kill myself."

depression,im so tired,i dont understand why my life is the way it is. all throughout highschool i didnt do anything and i never amounted to anything i would just go to school and waste away time on my phone doing jack shit. i realized that right after graduating and i went to community college to fix that and show my parents that i was capable of changing. my parents believe in me and my family is great my gf is amazing but i feel like my mind is ruining all of that for me. i got a 4.0 in community college and applied to various different top universities i really wanted to go to and got rejected from every SINGLE one. i could have gone to a state school and settled for less but i applied to great schools that have good programs for my major and wanted to succeed in getting into an awesome university to show my parents and my family im capable. every single time i feel like i can do something i run into an obstacle and i keep falling backwards. i feel like my negative emotions and my negative energy is putting all the people around me down. every single night before i sleep i wish i wasnt here and i wish that one day i wont have to feel the pain of waking up and doing the same thing everyday. im so useless and i cant do 1 thing right. my only chance to show my family that i can amount to something and it gets rejected. i am so tired of my life and i really dont know what to do. ive never worked so i have zero experience and i have 0 motivation to get up and do absolutely anything. im so negative to random people on games and i lash out my anger on random people in games i try to keep all my sadness bottled in and i always repeat myself everyday to my family or gf asking if im okay and i always say that im just tired tired tired tired. its true but in reality im just sick of being here

depression,What's wrong thinking about dying?,"Whenever I told people that I think about dying, they often told me that my thinking is ""wrong"" as if they view death is something bad but is it really bad though?"
depression,I really don’t make good friends,"Is it me or them?  I dunno. I’ve just been having issues lately. My son argued with me about money, took my babysitting privileges away, things escalated and I haven’t seen his family in 2 months. 

Meanwhile I was upset about that and my friend kept doing dick moves when it came to dumping our plans for his girlfriend. Here I just wanted hang time once in awhile but he either has to try to drag her into it or dump me for her. I got sick of it and he chose her. He was a primary support. 

A friend with whom I was fairly close pre-pandemic but drifted away from, they decided my Facebook was too negative and defriended me. 

One friend suddenly blocked me on fb and phone. This person was chosen family. As in we literally celebrate Christmas together and shit. He said something about Facebook (I think he was referencing me being mad at the friend from earlier) and said he needed to “work on himself.”  But you don’t just ghost someone you’re that close with. 

And finally Greg is an asshole. My car got stolen and he literally told me it was my fault. Fuck Greg. 

I basically have one close friend/support left. So as not to fuck things up, I probably need to get a bit of space in there."
depression,Is this depression?,I think relationships with other people are too stressful. There have been events to make me think this way. Like why do I keep trying? I don’t have any family. My mom is dead and my dad is a huge a hole. I joined the military and made great friends now we never talk. Had girlfriends but all of them cheated. It’s just what’s the point? Being sad and alone seems to be better than being happy in the moment of something fake. I don’t think two people can have an honest intention of caring for each other
depression,Peptides - looks very promising!,"I recently stumbled upon the subject of peptides and I am rather exited about it! There are many peptides, each with a different set of benefits: inducing sleep, restoring energy &amp; vitality, stimulating neurogenesis and/or plasticity, etc. Peptides seem to be rather safe.

Not only do I want to share this with you for your benefit (hopefully) and perhaps collectively do some research, but I also want to ask if anyone has tried peptides and if you could share your experience.

depression,Scary thought ..,"I work with the elderly, there are those who have families who care about there well being and than there are those who literally have no one, just a social worker. 
I’m currently single, no kids (I doubt I’ll have one) , a only child. I have living family members but we don’t keep in contact. I have a few friends but nobody calls me..
It’s so scary to think that I might be me, just alone forever. I hope and pray  this isn’t my future."
depression,Avoided admitting that I might suffer from depression because I feel like a burden.,"Just realized that yesterday. Anyone else? I think my SO is a very warm &amp; supportive person, and yet, I still would never tell him that I might suffer from depression because I’m scared he’d leave me (just my stupid brain feeding me bs). I bet many of you have always been there for others, but never really wanted to be a burden yourselves. 

It’s all spiraled out of control and I turned to booze (loads of it), without really knowing why I drink that much all of a sudden.

(Seeing a GP on the 1st to ask about meds. Terrified but also hopeful, that’s my last chance before I commit a slow suicide through booze)."

depression,I was at the swimming pool with my family yesterday,I felt very insecure about my body the whole day. It ruined the day. Today I cried about that. I wish I had a better body.
depression,I'm not sure why,"So I've been detached from life for a very long time. I thought I was good since I would anyway have my dissociation and disinterest to just carry me through and get the basics done like a job, maybe an average relationship, and just enough energy to go through the motions. Hell, maybe even occasionally enjoy some things too. But recently, something that would not seem very big in the grand scheme of things happened, and I've completely spiralled into feeling panicky, lost, feeling restless while doing anything, finding even the basic tasks overwhelming. I'm not sure if I'm even articulating this right, but these feelings are standing on top of an underlying feeling of complete and total tiredness. Its like they've have sprung up from the numbness and I feel both together. I don't know if this is normal..! Does anyone else feel this way? Or has anyone else who was numb suddenly started feeling very panicky, lost and restless?"
depression,Wallowing,I’m sinking into the pain and I’m letting my brain tell me I’ve ruined my life. I’ll never be happy. I’m not sure why but I’m ok with that truth. Just going to sit in the pain. I want to cut. What do I do?
depression,Nothing to Look Forward to,"I grew up abused (NPD parents), not close with any siblings, immigrated to a different country to be away from my stressors. Have spent years (and will probably a lifetime) working on myself just to feel normal.

Things were good for a while (Okay job, I have my gf of 15 yrs). But I am childfree, recently tried to get a dog and failed miserably, realized I don’t have the mental energy. These lately I’ve been feeling aimless and stuck, like I don’t know why I’m here and it’s a struggle everyday just to feel normal.

Gf also feels more like a roommate than a romantic partner. She refuses to see therapist to work on our problems. My relationship was the only thing that worked in my life. Now it’s no longer the case and I just feel there is nothing to look forward to. Sure, I can travel, get a hobby, but in the back of my mind I always ask ‘what’s the point?’

I don’t think I’m that suicidal but I often think if there is a way to end my life easily and without pain, it would not be the most tragic thing. I know people who know me might feel shocked or miss me for a while, but then life goes on."
depression,where is my mind?,[removed]
depression,I think I’m finally done. I hate myself and everything I do. I just ruin everyone’s life eventually with self-sabotaging things I don’t feel like I have control over.,"I’ve felt depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve lost contact with my family due to my parents abusing me throughout childhood. My grandmother (who really was more of a parent than either of mine were) died a few months ago and my parents prevented me from seeing her when she was dying. I’ve lost contact with a lot of my friends because I am barely surviving day-to-day. Not just mentally but financially I am just gone. I can’t even call it living paycheck to paycheck because i have to ration when I eat towards the the end of the month. 

My partner just left me, for good reason and I just feel this is another in a long line of repetitive failure. I just fundamentally don’t think I can cope without them. Im obviously not telling them this because I feel it’s selfish to. 

I just can’t live like this anymore. Nothing is going to undo the trauma I struggle with constantly. It’s hard to trust anyone has my best interests at heart even when they definitely do. I have ruined every single relationship i’ve had at this point and I’m done waiting to be struck by lightning."
depression,got out of depression + anxiety and here's how,"I started to notice how every time I was sad, anxious, or angry, it was because I was using too much of my head. In other words, I was overthinking too much, like right now. Then, I stopped thinking and could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste again. It was like thinking blocks your entire view of what's going around.

I went outside, and put my attention to how everything sounded. Even the cars, dogs barking, and the wind blowing all sounded equally peaceful. This all helped me stop thinking sexually, be happy consistently, and be way more productive.

A mindset I started to apply was not allowing myself to be sad ever again. When I feel slightly sad, straight up just said to myself 'no, I won't let myself be sad ever again.'

There are people who just want to be sad such as myself before. For those, do what makes you happy more often. If you have no clue, look around and try as much things as you can. I hope I could help"
depression,why do I feel this,"I can't shake this feeling of being lonely, but I have people to love and care about. It could be my family is spread out across America. I don't think that's it though. I went back to watch a show I used to watch with my brother and cried the whole time. Ugh, I just want things to be like the past again when me and my brothers hang out."
depression,I'm losing it,"Everyday is like a nightmare to me until nighttime hits, then my anxiety skyrockets and my depression takes a nap. it's always a dual fight between the two and I feel so exhausted about living more days to come. I have high ambitions but I feel so worthless that I feel like I shouldn't even bother achieving them. I feel irritated by everyone and everything, I fucking hate talking to people at this point.
everything is starting to make me gag, people being optimistic, marriage, shitty self care, fucking careers. it makes my stomach churn. Why do people do it
I don't want to live another 50 pathetic years before I rot in my grave, I want out while the wound is fresh.
I don't know. lately I just feel sick, metaphorically and physically. I can't stand life and whatever the fuck it's about.
These mundane tasks give me fucking cancer.
I don't want to fucking cook and eat and shit and take a shower and run shitty errands.
I have no control over my emotions anymore, one minute I'm crying my eyes out, the next I have a little hope then all goes downhill again until I start being a nervous wreck and weirdly give a fuck about lame human society stuff. 
I zone out to such an extent that I cant hold a two minute conversation

depression,Hi could you help me,"this I am not sure where to go with this but I’ve been struggling for a really long time, I uh don’t know how to word it all but basically I don’t know what to do? Like in a general sense of living


As a kid my dad was pretty abusive and I ended up with anger issues that I got therapy for as a kid, anyways he got increasingly more abusive until I started standing up for myself and fighting him back ( physically and by threatening to call the police) and my mom I thought really loved me as a kid but as I grew older she became more and more verbally abusive , one that really stuck by me was when she told me she could never love me because I couldn’t behave like a normal kid ( I think I have adhd ) I couldn’t tell u because I never got tested for anything since my parents “don’t  believe in that’s stuff”. (Also for a really long time I had a hatred for my skin colour since I got made fun of it in like grade 1 by a white kid) but I’m over that (it took a long time though). anyways here are the problems that arose from that. 
am extremely toxic to the people around me, I drag them down and hurt them but I don’t mean to, I don’t know why I do it it just happens. and the thing so do become increasing more and more unforgivable and cruel and mean and disgusting (I would explain in further detail but you’d also hate me like I hate myself )  I rarely try to get girlfriends because when I do I am manipulative and dismissive, when I have crushes I become creepy and obsessive. I put my friends down and hurt them and break their trust, i also never reach out to any one  (unless I want something from them) but I’ve worked on this in particular  a bit since everyone has complained about it, (I feel even though I’m a bit sensitive I am very open to criticism). i want to know how to become a better friend/lover if you could help ?

Secondly I have rejected every open opportunity because I feel I am not worthy of them (also for some reason every time I openly talk about these opportunities them magically and randomly always fall through?) (like they just disappear completely?) and for some reason I can’t keep a job because I always fall through with commitment and also just being a general  dumbass (I would tell you my stories but they’re extremely specific and if anyone I knew read them they would instantly know it’s me (like on the level of reading a “Florida man….” You know it’s bad and very weirdly stupid and specific. Like these are very costly mistakes or very stupid mistakes that no ordinary person with half a brain would make, and I am very ashamed of them so I don’t actively go out and look for a job anymore (I’m a neet) 


Thirdly, I said I was good at school as I was but I never tried to go into university or anything similar because I don’t really want an actual job ( I don’t want to work till I’m old) also there was never really Anything that particularly interested me depending on my mental state I could say I equally enjoy/hate everything and anything. and if it died I would probably need to upgrade since I basically stopped showing up my last year of school and dropped 2 of my sciences because I became extremely depressed  (even though the were my easiest subjects) and got  60s in la and social (I did no assignments at all the entire year) (I still got 90s in math and calc because there was a rule that your assignments would be filled by your test mark.  I don’t hate school I just hate the idea of working in general so I didn’t go to uni or any thing like that (I would be open to the idea but I don’t really know where to start or how to look for something I’d enjoy ) 

The main problem I have is that for some reason  everytime I try at something it fails and explodes in my face, that harder I try the more it ends up backfiring,  then I give up  and 3 months later after a lot of pep talk I try and and the cycle repeats itself and I go back to into a depressive episode, I can’t seem to make any progress in my life no matter how hard I try and I don’t know why, it also feels like everyone is looking down on me now cuz they  see I haven’t accomplished anything and I always get asked “what are you song with your life?”

For reference I am 20  have no job no car I don’t go to school I am not particularly good a anything I have no hobbies I mostly just spend my time jerking off in my room (I do go to the gym but I don’t particularly see the big thing about getting muscles or anything I just do it because I heard it suppose to help even though it really hasn’t done anything for me (expect make me look bigger I guess) like I said before even though I’m not particularly  attractive or anything I’m pretty short too I have never really struggled getting attention from girls but I don’t seem to be able to work up past initial attraction anymore ( I’ve been holed up So long I forgot how to have normal conversation  or flirt or make comebacks or anything like that, I think I am still funny because people seem to laugh when I talk but maybe it’s because they’re laughing at me idk :(. I should probably mention my friend are kind of all growing more apart  from me (distancing  themselves) I don’t blame them because I’m kind of a loser that just annoys and hurts them.

Anyways bro or broette thank you for listening to my rant but my question is how do I fix myself? I have all these relay internalized problems that I don’t really know how to fix? i don’t really doubt myself but I conditionally judge myself for just living? I can only hope that it’s gonna work out for me but I don’t really know where to start anything? Also I want to say that I know my childhood trauma doesn’t excuse anything i do or have done but I just don’t know how to be better (everyone has baggage but it shouldn’t affect the people around you) I just need help on improving? and I’ve made mistakes that are unforgivable but how do I move on from them? And how do fix a relationship I’ve broke with a friend after I did something unforgivable but they still forgave me? Also i am not trying to hyperbol anything or blow anything out of proportion everything I wrote is what I think is to scale/realistic."
depression,"I just can't study math alone, almost every time i do so i just think about suicide","I feel extra dumb for this, it's embarrassing i couldn't fix it for years, because of that i failed school several times, like when i do programming and computer science in a way my neurons are fine, but some reason i already struggle with my mental health since i have a bunch of issues with getting more than 2 people interact with me at the same time and a bunch of other things i just don't get, i just can't get an hold on myself, it doesn't make any sense

It's kinda depression but it goes from entire months in from days yes and no and just straight up nothing, very random, i just can study a few subjects i have passion for 

Maybe I'm just stupid, no idea"
depression,I just feel like I can’t breathe anymore,"Idk what to say… everything’s going so fast and I can’t keep up. The mental stress itself is eating me alive much less the obstacles ahead. Some people believe in me but I think I polluted their views on me. Right now as I’m writing this I feel as though I keep getting these weird waves of not being in touch with reality? Idk how to put it. It’s like a haze. Also it just feels like I’m being left in the dust. Idk if I want to get better cause it’s something I’ve known for so long, as bad as that sounds. But I’m so tired. I genuinely can’t take it anymore. A friend of a person ik committed suicide due to the same reason I’m currently stressing right now. I see it now, well Ig ive understood it from before but I actually FEEL how bad it is. I’ve also realised that no matter how much I speak about it, no one can ever remove this tumour. Im practically being poisoned slowly. I sort of called it though. Whether it was me being psychic or it was a self fulfilling prophecy, it just might lead me to my life being ruined before it even started.  It’s this weird concoction of fear desperation and a lot of hopelessness all mixed into one. I don’t think I would recognise myself if the me of 2 years ago saw the me of today. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know what to do. It’s raining right now. I like the rain. But I know it will come back to me. And it will cripple me and render me immobile once again. I want to be like *them* but it feels sort of impossible. They will never understand. I just want to be free. Not tethered to some self constructed void that draws away any remaining life force that I might still call mine. But what even is mine anymore. Who *am* I anymore. Everyone looks for happy endings, but I think that’s too unrealistic and jubilant. Maybe life doesn’t always have happy endings. Maybe we should just learn that, and maybe then we will be a bit more free."
depression,How does depression affect your relationships?,"Depression affects everyone differently. I’ve struggled with trauma-related depression off and on for nearly half my life. For me, with regards to relationships, it can impact my ability to get close to people because of trust issues and low self-esteem. It doesn’t impact my ability to fall in love and continue to experience deep feelings of love. So when I start feeling the urge to isolate myself, I pretty much exclusively withdraw from friends and turn to my partner and family for support.

My last partner was different. He also suffers from depression and it’s prevented him from figuring out what he wants to do in life and then doing it. And it seems like because of that, he has trouble feeling strong feelings of love, to the point that he constantly questions his feelings in relationships and only realizes after it’s over that he loved that person. When he’s really struggling, he wants to run away. On the other hand, he has no trouble connecting with more “superficial” relationships (acquaintances, not-close friendships).

I would like to know, how does depression impact your relationships with people?"
depression,what is this fuckery,"why does depression actually just suck ass. when u get out of an episode you feel like you might be actually acquired the skills to know how to not fall into another one again but no. this shit just happen a over and over and over and over again. I'm sick of getting my hopes up and finally feeling like I could live, when another episode happens and you are literally back at square fucking one. I'm tired."
depression,Helping an introverted friend with depression/ASD,"A friend of mine, who has been diagnosed with depression and ASD, rarely leaves their house (they are at an online school), except to spend time with me and my friends. They have some good online friends they spend time with online, but never IRL.

When my depression was more severe, spending time with friends IRL not only alleviated my depression in that moment, but for some time after. They might be an introvert, but I can't imagine that never seeing anyone face-to-face except for your parents (who they don't have the best relationship with) is healthy or beneficial to anyone's mental health, even if you have autism, right?

Now to the immediate problem: Every time something is slightly different/uncomfortable about the (weekly) meeting with my friend group, they say they don't want to come anymore. Examples include: someone else (from the friend group) has to pick them up, someone they don't know as well joins, we have to play a different game because too many people are missing, their depression is worse than usual, and so on.

Most of the time I can convince them to come anyways, and most of the time they seem to be completely fine. They say this is because they are masking their discomfort, and they say that they are exhausted after the social interaction, and that might be true. 
Now my question (and I hope especially that some introverted, depressed people with ASD can chime in): Do you think that it's still a net-positive to meet your IRL friends? How much of their initial unwillingness to come is cloudy judgement because of depression/social anxiety? Is it actually better for them to sit in their house all day, covers shut with depressed thoughts?

I really want to help them, but I don't know if I'm doing it right."
depression,I feel like I don't belong in human society,"I don't know what else to say about it or I have too much to say. Basically I don't know how to have close friend and have never been in a relationship. I don't like the way they work but still feel inadequate for being the only one not participating. In short I just feel so fucking lonely and am afraid I'll never experience love or intimacy or anything like it, and it all seems to come so easily to everyone else. Anyway I'm feeling low today and it's nice to vent here instead of bothering the few people willing to talk to me."
depression,Is there such thing as weather depression not just seasonal depression?,"Can anybody relate to having depressive episodes directly related to the weather on a particular day? 

I’m aware of seasonal depression but my understanding is this is caused by a period/season of darker colder weather which repeats each year in a cycle. 

For me (36/m/UK) a single dark and wet day can send me into a big depression whereby I feel zero enthusiasm or hope about life. I’m just floating in a trance through the day and cannot even imagine there being another sunny day in the future. Straight away I’m thinking I need to live in a warmer climate and fixate on planning where I’m going to move to. 

This week has been a prime example in the East of England. We’ve had gorgeous weather and I’ve been on top of the world. Bouncing out of bed each day, exercising, eating well, etc. then yesterday was a very dark, cold day and I just felt awful. However today is bright and sunny again and I’m perfectly fine and cannot understand how I was that awful person yesterday. 

Can anyone relate? Is this a known disorder? 

I’m a smart guy, I’m well read about depression and I’ve had a tonne of therapy over the years so I understand the theory behind how our surroundings effect our mood and techniques to lessen the impact, but this is something that seems so overpowering. Nearly everywhere in the world has winters, and those places that don’t will have awfully hot summers. There is no perfect place to live, but that awareness doesn’t seem to help. 

TLDR: Can seasonal depression actually present in a more short term form of daily weather depression?"
depression,My brain is a broken mess,"I’m breaking people. I can’t stop posting about my issues. I can’t stop thinking about how great one year or so was better and I was happy. 

I have ADD, health anxiety that patting  myself down with every jolt of the head in fear of a concussion (my brain is too broken for me to chance breaking it even more). 

I also have Depression.

I just can’t take waking up into a world of boring rejection. My hobbies reject me, my friends somewhat reject, my mind rejects me.
If I was to kill myself, my family and, if they exist, god would reject me.

I try to reject me my reality on a daily basis but it’s just so hard when your brain is so unbelievably unmendable that you can barely read your own name or the description to a show you’re interested in.

depression,My life,"I go to work at 7:40am and push carts for 7 hours in the summer weather. No time to socialize just carts. I go home tired. I don’t have anyone right now. I really want relationships and human connection and I got the balls to try to reconnect with an old friend but I could tell by their lack of questions and dry responses that they’re not interested. I feel I dont have value as a person. That’s why nobody wants to be around me. I have passions but im too tired, too much of a loser to get up and do them which just makes me more depressed. Ive been in therapy for 9 months and I doesn’t help at all. Every day just makes me more frustrated and mad. It looks so easy for everyone else."

depression,I am planning at some point to no longer exist thanks to my profession as a teacher. I just don’t know when or how yet.,"
Been dealing with a lot of shitty stuff at work and my job is in limbo.  I made a long post yesterday about being the subject of an investigation that I ended up deleting because I was legally advised to in case it turned against me.  I’m afraid of letting everyone down, even though I know I did nothing that was criminal or worth losing my job over.  However, unfortunately we live in a society where people want to shoot first before they hear your side of things. It’s a long story that I don’t really want to get into again.  My family and friends know I’m depressed and want to be supportive, but I don’t really think they know how bad it is.  I’ve been seeing a therapist and PA that prescribes me meds but I cannot say it’s been helping. When I choose to stop existing, I would like to get it done as quickly and as painlessly as possible. In the end, we’re just meaningless and replaceable and I’ve become discouraged from wanting to continue, because I can’t trust anyone anymore.  It’s going to feel embarrassing to return if/when hopefully everything works out because who knows what students and staff have been saying about me throughout this time reassigned.  If people knew how to communicate an issue to begin with and not go behind someone’s back and put their livelihood on the line, life would be so much easier, but people have to panic and treat everything as if it’s some federal incident.  Now I’m stuck in limbo in a corrupt and slow bureaucratic system that is indifferent to the well-being of its schools and teachers.  I feel that if I resign it will make me look guilty.  I feel there’s no other way out of this.  I am sorry."

depression,Struggling to make long term goals,"Basically ever since middle school I always told myself I’m going to kill myself after graduating high school… but I didn’t. 
So right now I’ve been taking 2-3 gap years from college/school. Changed my mental to “I’m going to kill myself when I turn 30” 
It’s so hard to make plans for my future when I genuinely don’t believe I’ll live long. How do I get out of this mindset?"
depression,would I be sent to a psych ward,"Hi. I'm currently in the process of engaging with a psychiatrist to deal with my mental health issues. If I tell my psychiatrist that i have a plan to commit suicide (overdosing on sleeping pills) and the means to do it, but I'm currently not actively suicidal nor do I intend to proceed with the plan (as of right now), would I be forcefully detained in a hospital? I want to be honest with my psychiatrist yet I'm afraid of the possible repercussions. I also don't wish to get my parents involved in this. Thank you."

depression,possible reunion with childhood bff,"Today I met her mom by chance, dad and I were eating at a stall and suddenly a woman came to our table. She introduced herself and I can barely recognize her, it has been at least 15 years since I last saw her. I'm friend with her oldest child while my younger sister is friend with her younger child. My sister is still in contact with her friend while I lost all contact. The reason being we don't have phones back then. We went to different secondary school and life just goes on I guess.

So now we're both in the late twenties and haven't been in contact since primary school. She has had a great life from what I hear. She went to elite secondary school, studied oversea, have a great job probably. The siblings are all successful people. My sister is successful too.

I don't feel like contacting her because how can I explain how my life turned out. I'm depressed and unemployed. I used to be a bright kid but my performance declined because of depression I guess. Many things happened to me, I was bullied, humiliated, etc so I became depressed. Her mom asked for my number so she could give me her daughter's number. I saved her number but I don't know what to do with it. So now her mom has my number and if I don't contact her, she'll probably give my number. Her mom said she'll be happy if I contacted her because she has no friends if she's back in town. She lives like 12 hours away from our hometown.

I don't even know what I want to hear from you guys, but any feedback is welcomed. You could share your similar stories or any advice/input. Thank you."
depression,Depressed but restless and agitated?,"I've had severe depression for 4 years (20F) and go through very low spells where I feel v suicidal and down and fairly low in energy but push through. Prior to or following these periods I get very restless and agitated for days/weeks. I can manage on only a few hours of sleep and feel ok, I feel very restless and shaky like I have lots of energy and need to just go for a long run or do a workout or something to burn the energy otherwise I get so restless I need to self-harm instead because it feels like sm built up negative emotion. Sort of like a fight-flight response all the time with no trigger. Or like i've had loads of caffeine constantly. It's hard to direct it into something positive because underlying this is negative thoughts. 
This makes it a dangerous cocktail of having strong urges and the energy to act on dangerous thoughts. 
This does pass after a week or so though and i go back to normal/a bit slower to my usual depressed state. 
This is when I need much more sleep and feel slow and lethargic but still carry on as usual. 
Does anyone else have these periods of high energy anxious-like feeling?"
depression,I’m just so tired,"I’m so tired, I can’t deal with reality. I don’t want to be present, so I’m constantly spaced out. I’ll do anything to escape. Drugs are my release. I know I’m hurting myself I just can’t stop, I don’t want to face the real world. I want to rot in bed, but I can’t. I study and I work. Then with 10 hours to spare at the end of my day, I smoke myself to sleep. I’m just so tired. All I seem to do is fantasise of death."

depression,What’s the point of life,"I just don’t wanna suffer anymore. No matter how hard I try, it just never gets better.

In real life, I never complain and stay positive around people. They disrespect me and complain about small fucking details yet have better life than mine. What the fuck is wrong with me for real?

I got toxic parents, but am living abroad and trying my best working 21 hours a week to make ends meet while studying at the same time. But it’s just not enough. My friends are buying what they want and have a desk to study and work at home. 

I CAN’T EVEN AFFORD A GOD DAMN DESK!!!!

I’ve been fucking broke for 3 years and I can’t take this BS anymore. Life is easy if your parents are rich, period.

I hate when people who got rich parents tell me “Money isn’t everything bro so you should be grateful.”

I know it’s not, but it’s necessary!!

Tbh, I just hate my life at this point because I don’t compare myself to other people but I can’t help it. I wish I had a comfortable chair and a desk to work and study.

I wish I could eat healthy food every day. Insurance got me fucked up, too. I’m just losing my hope.

What the fuck am I supposed to do even  my parents don’t love me

Fuck everything"
depression,Tinder is just starting to feel like a scam tbh,"I have been using it for almost a year now and barely get any likes, despite the fact Tinder says I have 17 people who have liked my profile but I can't see them of course unless I buy Tinder Gold. So now I have been liking literally every profile now to find who liked me because obviously I should come across one of those accounts sooner or later right? Wrong.

The amount of times I liked as many profiles as I can only to get to the 'We can't find anyone else near you' screen is jarring at this point. Either I haven't actually had 17 people like my profile and tinder is lying or I'm just simply not allowed to see who liked me unless I spend money on Gold.

Either way, it feels like a complete scam. And It depresses the shit out of me, someone who can't go out to meet new people often at all."
depression,I feel like an impostor,"I started meds and seeing my psychiatrist every two weeks (tentative). I have been feeling numb for the past couple of days and just blaming myself for things. Maybe I’m just lazy, I’m not really sick or people have much bigger problems (although the other half of me of course is rational enough to know this isn’t true). It is draining and makes me wanna end it so I don’t have to deal with the constant loathing. If anyone else is dealing with this, how do you cope?"
depression,defeated,"Constantly an unrelenting stress eating me, for as long as i can remember i have been stressed about something or usually multiple things.

depression,Why do I feel like I deserve this?,"Everytime I want to do something that brings me an ounce of happiness, I immediately start doubting myself,I say I'm not good enough to do it and that there's no point because I'll just let everyone down. I always give into those thoughts and choose just to not do anything because I feel like I don't deserve to be happy or do any of the things I enjoy. 

How do I win against this feeling and thoughts?"
depression,goodbye :),"im sorry for not being good at communication idk whats wrong with me i wish i would've talked to someone but you know what I'm like I can't talk about my feelings, i just don't want to hurt anyone i never wanted to hurt anyone, only myself, I've hated myself for the longest time and don't understand why I didn't do this sooner maybe because I thought it would get better, sorry for not being strong enough or good enough sorry to my ex's if i caused you any pain and I hope you have a bright future and find someone that will treat you right, sorry to my old friends that I failed bc of my poor decisions, sorry to Alyssa i will forever love you, you were what kept me motivated to keep going, I appreciate you so much you didn't fail me at all, please be happy for me I will be with you the whole time, I told you that id always be here for you and even after this I've still kept that promise, sorry for doing anything bad in my life i have to do this to stop the endless feeling of emptiness, please dont feel like its anyones fault, its all my fault, i hope you understand my decision, its my time to go i wish i never went through this but i guess its just the way it has to go. i lost all interest and motivation in everything and nothing made me happy anymore I couldn't see myself living passed 18 and with the way my mindset has been for the past 4 years nothing seemed to be changing the more I stayed the weaker I became, every second I spent alive the more time I was waisting, i don't want any of you joining me, as my wish please stay and be nice to eachother, treat people better then you treated me I don't want anyone to go through this, Goodbye everyone,this is what I've wanted for a long time so don't feel bad for me I'm happy now."
depression,Nothing is ever enough for me,"I always feel insecure and unloved.  I have everything, but it’s never enough.

I wanted friends.  So I got friends, but I still wasn’t happy.  No amount of good experiences can get me out of my head.  I take more than I give, and I always feel awkward and disconnected even though I’m close with several people.

I wanted fancy degrees.  So I got those, but I’m still an undisciplined idiot who has no skills.  Just a few pieces of paper and the weight of Ivy League expectations.

I wanted sex and love.  I had my first kiss at 24, found a woman who loved me.  I loved her too, and it wasn’t enough.  I left her because  she slept with other men earlyish (4 months) into the relationship.  She said “we never discussed exclusivity”, and I tried o make it work for the next year, but I couldn’t get over it.  Now nobody else compares… it’s been over a year since we split and I still miss her sometimes.  I don’t trust her though, and I hate sex now bc of the trauma (among other reasons). Oh, and my dick isn’t shaped properly and doctors are useless… so there’s that too.

So I saw a therapist.  Wait, actually half a dozen over the years.  The only one that stuck for a while gave up on me.  She ran out of ideas.  I can’t say I blame her, even though it hurt.

So I needed money.  My parents always paid for everything I wanted… but it was never enough.  I grew up wealthy and can’t be happy with less. 

So I tried to be successful and focus on my career.  But I’m spoiled and I can’t help but hate every job because I feel like they don’t care about me.  I wish I had a mentor who valued me for more than I could provide in the short-term.

So I worked on myself.  I’ve been in great shape, dressed well…etc, but it doesn’t make me happy for long.  I can never sleep and the nightly battle drives me insane.  I saw a doctor for this and it isn’t working.


Now, my hair is falling out and I’m gaining weight.  I’m convinced that I’m broken.  I don’t want to die, but I don’t see how I can live when I’m never happy.  I’ve tried everything, and it’s never enough.  Now I don’t want anything.  I’m thinking of giving up.  I’ve already been an emotional burden on people for so long, and I don’t know what else to do."
depression,Is virtual psychiatry/therapy effective?,"There's no place that I can physically go to in a reasonable amount of time that has a decent rating and is allegedly low cost. The good ones that do have those 2 qualities are too far but most offer telehealth appointments.

I don't think they'd work for me because I have a relatively short attention span. I also don't want to go to a badly rated one, or one that doesn't even have a rating because I've read way too many news articles about patients getting molested.

Do these actually work for people?"
depression,feeling fatigued,"I feel so fatigued. I have a skin infection, a boil. Its a chronic thing. Going outside makes me feel worse, especially if I have to be surrounded by people.

depression,I just realized that I am so lucky than the others maybe you are too.,"When I'm walking down the streets, I see some homeless people and street vendors trying to make a living, I used the internet to catch up some news i see some people who lost everything, and I just realized that my life is 10x better life than other and that I am so lucky because I got a place to stay and sleep every day, never run out of food, I have a job, and pay my bills on time.

And yet I'm not still quite understand why I am not happy, it's like something is holding me back to make my life even better, I couldn't remember the last time that I am so genuinely happy that it lasted for a few days, even months without thinking about my past or the future just existing in the present. 

These days I'm just faking my happiness, deep inside my heart, I am so hopeless that not existing is all in my mind.

why is that? is this a curse?"
depression,Broken up with a week after finding out I’m pregnant,"24f. Last week, I discovered I am pregnant. Which I know so many people dream about and pray for and covet. And I wish that were the case for me so badly. I wish I could be a mom. My partner realized that he couldn’t handle it, on top of his many other stressors in his life, so he broke ties. I’m trying very hard not to be upset with him but I am having the worst dysphoria I’ve had to experience in my life. I was living in his apartment because I haven’t felt particularly good about the people who live in mine. Half of my life is in a car right now that I’ll need to give up bc I am borrowing the car from my partner. I am uprooted in so many ways. 

I’ve had a bad spell of depression &amp; anxiety in the past month related to work &amp; unknowingly being pregnant so in many ways I let myself go and felt secure enough in my relationship to lean on him a bit. But I feel completely shattered. It came as a shock to me because this was the person who showed me what pure joy was for the first time. I respect his decision, but I am hurting so ferociously.

I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper and I don’t know if I am going to be able to pull myself out this time."
depression,i want the free hug,"my uni is having a mental health event where they said we can get free hugs from a mascot and i really want to go for that. it has been years since i've had a friend and gotten a hug. i feel very lonely and felt comforted that a classmate sat next to me once this week. she didn't talk to me or anything, but it felt nice to be near another person like that when i've gotten used to sitting by myself in classes. i feel like i've isolated myself to the point where i feel like my existence is both invisible and repugnant, that people don't want to be near me. 

unfortunately the event is on the only day i'm not on campus (i have classes 4 days of the week) and i really wanna take the day off for a break. but idk i think i'll end up going just to get a hug from a giant bear. i'm an introvert but that would recharge me more than being alone and stuffing my face with food."
depression,Sabotaging my career,"So I have a pretty good job and get paid well for it. But, the stress of the job has slowly but surely contributed to a build of anxiety and depression over the last couple of years, to the point where I just want to quit. Like most people, I'm two paychecks away from bankruptcy, so quitting really isn't an option. I feel trapped in a cycle, that I can't find a way out.

I've gone through counselling and meds, but it just seems to be a band aid. Of course, I've looked at changing jobs, but I'm just making myself more anxious and depressed thinking about it, I can't even gather the motivation to start a search and go through the whole dance.

Does anyone have any advice on how to break the cycle of depressive thoughts about work, to the point where a career can be salvaged and even to the point where I love my job, again?

Thanks!"
depression,how do I become happier?,"I've done things that should make me happy, i lost weight, finished a school year without summer school, and I feel somewhat more comfortable in my skin, but nothing I do helps, i hate myself and want to die, i feel like I'm unlovable and have a face only a mother could love, and fear a relationship but I've been told I'm nice, have a good personality, and that's it, I got called handsome by a drunk lady, but nothing after that no one saying "" hey my friend likes you"" or anything like that, people talk to me like I'm mentally retarded or something, my dog doesn't even make me happy and I cry everytime I see her because she's itching and I don't know what to do. I've tried socializing but I always feel off or awkwardly look away and quickly snap back. I feel like my friends use me so they can hotbox a room and have a place to stay but if they have a reason to drop me they would.
I hate myself, I'm the problem, I fuck up my own life, I just want help"
depression,Anhedonia and going back to college,"I(26m) know I need to go back to college for a more useable degree but can’t seem to care about any subject I apply myself to. I’ve tried graphic design, video production, programming, psychology, and welding. I know there are more things out there to try but nothing sparks anything inside me. Every subject is meh. I was told I showed promise in all the above subjects I just could care less about any of them or anything really."
depression,Trigger Warning ⚠️ (mental illness mentions and physical illness mentions): A 25 year old struggling with depression and an anxiety disorder,"I had the misfortune of being born in a narrow minded third world country. To make matters worse, I’m gay and not religious (most are homophobic and religious though many are mostly hypocrites). I’m nothing like the a lot of its people. Most of those who are open minded and have the resources leave to other countries and all that’s left are mainly the ones who still believe in good ol’ folklore. I’m not saying everything is bad because at least I eat food and I’m not hungry although I do worry about going hungry because I’m unemployed. My grandma is the only one I really have and she currently is battling cancer. The rest of my family are just incredibly toxic and uncultured. My parents abandoned me since birth after my own mother poisoned me but I survived though I almost died, ever since I had a huge weight problem due to it and a shitty immune system. I applied to thousands of jobs since I graduated in 2020 in France. I couldn’t work in France because France chose to no longer give Visas to North Africans, which is very depressing to even think of, to think of how we’re just the secluded losers no one wants. I have a masters degree and I speak three languages fluently plus some Italian but it doesn’t matter. Jobs in my country won’t ever hire you because the corruption rate is incredibly high and nepotism is the main way to get a job and I don’t have access to that kind of albeit unethical “privilege”. Other companies around the world won’t even hire someone with no visa because most don’t wanna bother with visa sponsorship. A company hired me (big 4) in Belfast then bailed when the visa sponsorship took more than two weeks. After that I sat in my room crying everyday, broke and sad as hell. I don’t wanna let the dark thoughts win but it’s hard when everything is hard and I have no open doors."
depression,The future scares me,Everytime I look around me and think about things and how they're moving away from the present and become past gives me anxiety and makes me feel depressed. I will open games I play and see no one playing from my friends. I haven't spoken to old friends and I just transferred school so I don't have anyone and I don't feel like I belong.
depression,I’m so tired,I’m watching my niece while my sister works from home. We are in my bedroom. She just keeps grabbing my shit. I have nail polish on my dresser and she keeps grabbing them and banging them together. I could bring her downstairs but she’d throw a fit. She’s happy in here and I’m so fucking tired. I don’t feel like moving her or hearing her scream and cry. I don’t even get paid for how much I watch this kid. I pay rent to live here and watch her. I buy my own food. She’s now taking all my clothes out of my dresser. I don’t want this. I want to sleep. I have to drive 3 hours later to drive my dad back to his house from the airport. He didn’t even ask if I wanted to. Just told me to. I’ll probably buy myself some donuts and find a therapist later. I need therapy. I’m fucking miserable. I don’t even care about anything anymore. I don’t care if my niece wants to destroy my bedroom. I’m supposed to find a job but I can’t balance babysitting my niece and working. I don’t have the energy for it. I’m scared getting a job will push me over the edge. I’ve had jobs before and the beginning is always so hard. I end up enjoying my job but it takes a while and the first few months are hell. I can barely take care of myself. I want to fucking die. All my clothes are now on the floor. I don’t eat. I’m barely hungry. Looking at food makes me nauseous. I want to get better but I don’t know how. I’ll try to ask my dad about therapy. I’m just so tired. The worst part is I actually sleep at least 8 hours a night. I don’t understand why I’m still tired.
depression,I feel burnt-out and like a zombie,[deleted]
depression,Why am I like this?,"So I’ve been really considering getting professional help lately and I probably should have done that more than 15 years ago but when I was a kid my dad would always say depression and anxiety were not a thing it was just normal feelings that everyone had sometimes but you just have to “get over it” so I was in denial for a long time that I was actually depressed or had anxiety but lately my motivation and mental health is at an all time low and I feel like my whole world is crumbling around me even tho I know there are people who are in much worse situations. 

I have a decent paying full time job doing inside sales for an electronics distributor and lately I will get on my computer in the morning and it legitimately takes me 2-3 hours before I start doing work because I have 0 motivation to do anything and I always end up aimlessly scrolling on my phone or gaming computer when I’m working from home or day dreaming about whatever until I finally can get my focus together to start getting anything done. Then by the time I start I am already so backed up with emails and other things I end up working until 8-9 pm just to make it seem like I’m doing my job because no matter how hard I try I just can’t stay focused on my work for even 1 hour at a time without getting distracted for at least an hour or more and it causes me to feel so anxious and overwhelmed and I know it’s my own dumbass fault I’m doing it to myself. Then when I finally log off my computer after work I’m so overwhelmed and anxious and have this feeling if doom I smoke so much weed to cover up the bad feelings I get every night that I end up not waking up to my alarm some days. I’ll call my boss and make up an excuse or drive myself to urgent care or do anything to justify being late. Even the days I do wake up on time but lay in bed staring at the ceiling dreading getting up and I just lay there until the last minute and I’ll end up driving 90 mph on the highway to get there still 10 minutes late. 

Every day I feel like could be the day I get fired and I have no idea what I would do financially I would lose everything but part of me wants to get fired so I can let my mind have a break. 

I often do everything I can to avoid interaction with other people at both at work and in my personal life but at work we have certain days we have to come into the office for events and when it’s time to go interact with people I will sit in the back of the room only speak when spoken to or I will purposely call off the days we have events going on and I hate being like that. I sit at my desk all day not getting up to avoid possibly having to have a conversation with someone and I am just an anxious mess most of the time at work. Luckily I work a hybrid schedule and am at home 2-3 days a week but even then I procrastinate so much and get stuck in the same cycle.

I do have some days (although lately they have been few and far between) where I am completely fine and other days I feel like there’s a dark cloud over my head and it follows me everywhere I go. 

My mom is on disability for severe depression and seeing her end up completely broke living on welfare, divorced, and heavy into drugs most of my life l always swore I would not end up like that but I fear that my life is headed down the same path. 

I often have thoughts that my only mental relief would be if I were dead. I have never attempted suicide although one time about 5 years ago I came up with a plan to drive 20 hours to Colorado, go hiking in the Rockies and jump off the highest cliff I could find. I picked colorado bc that is my favorite place I’ve ever been and I wanted to go somewhere far in hopes my body would not be identified and my friends and family would not find out I committed suicide. I ended up driving for about 5 hours and broke down crying, had to stop on the side of the road and then I turned around and drove home.

I do not want to die but I feel like a broken glass that someone duct taped back together and am barely holding together. I don’t have a bad life I know that I have a girlfriend that loves me and I want to propose soon but I can never hold a job for more than 2 years because I always end up mentally checking out and I either get fired or I will get so close to being fired that I end up quitting and who in their right mind would want to marry someone so unreliable and just an overall mess of a person like me? 

To anyone that read this far, first of all thank you I know it was long winded but I just needed to get it off my chest, and second, have you had a similar struggle and managed to improve by medication or treatment or both? I would really appreciate some insight because I feel like I’m at my breaking point and I can’t keep living like this or I’m going to have a complete mental breakdown and lose everything in my life if I don’t get help."

There are so many adulting milestones that I haven't reached. I've outgrown my past life. Trying to get out but rentals are so hard to find even though I'm willing to pay an arm and a leg.

depression,Antidepressants overdose .,"2 months ago I had a Citalopram overdose, the side
effects were unbearable and to this day I silently suffer

conscious for a whole day and kept opening my eyes
and close them back while having spasms in my feet
and fingers. When I was able to talk I asked my family
where I was and didn't realize I had a memory loss untill
they kept asking me personal questions. I forgot
everything happened in my life a year prior. They kept
reminding me and showing me pictures but couldn't
remember anything and I didn't even know my age. The
first 3 days in hospital were torturous since I couldn't
walk or move by myself. To this day I can't remember
how and when I took the pills, as well as the day they
found me having a seizure. I also can't remember when
the ambulance came to take me. The 8 days I spent in
hospital were nothing but a lesson to me ( even though
I still can't remember few things about them). I suffered
a lot from this attempt and to this day my memory
keeps fucking me up.
Now after 2 months, I'm trying to gain my strength back
and improving my damaged memory. although it is not
easy but Im getting there.
If you find yourself having suicidal thoughts try to talk
to a specialist because it isn't easy. You still have a lot
good things that are coming. Try to distract yourself
with things you love or things you never tried. Folks

problem"".
YOU MATTER.

I shared my story in the antidepressant community too."
depression,Is he an anti-lgbt douche?,"When I was in high school, I told a female 50-year-old sex teacher that I liked her. She was BFFs with this other teacher who was a male. They were both from the Middle East. They were BFFs and talked all the time. I think she told him what I told her because sometimes he would look at me in the hallways and smile, like he knew something. I also saw them a couple of times gossiping together and she looked angry, like she was complaining about me or something. He was still polite to me and wasn't rude to me until my graduation. He saved his rudeness for the final day, and he didn't even congratulate me.

On my graduation, I was told that I needed to stand in line in front of that male teacher who was my teacher's friend fo get my diploma. I stood in line before him, waiting for my diploma. He looked at me and his eyes bore into mine. He was pissed. He gave me this hateful stare like he wanted to cremate me and burn my ashes. He gave me that same hateful that she gave me when I attended the graduation of the class a year prior when I gave her that hopeful look again, and she responded with her face what she thought. I wasn't even standing close to him or said anything to him and he yelled, ""HEY! CAN WE ALL JUST BACK UP?!?!?!?!?!"" He didn't even congratulate me! She didn't either. Did he know about the crush? Is he an anti-lgbt douche?"
depression,im really trying but living isnt worth it when failure is all i can only foresee,"I honestly can't see the point of living and hopefully posting stuff here can salvage the very last bit of will to live I have in here. It'd be great if someone can offer something powerful just so I can hang onto it. But I just need to vent, or even preface. 

I just feel like I'm destined to fail and be miserable. It doesn't matter how hard I try. Im really tired of living when my future is destined to be a failure. 

I need help, but I'm too tired at the same time. And the queue to seeing a psychologist is too damn long.

depression,Managed to get on medication!,"I've been dealing with chronic depression for almost three years, I'm 19 so its taken up a good chunk of my adolescence.. But i finally managed to get on meds! Got prescribed Sertraline, hopefully it works even a little bit - might look into therapy again as well. I'm hiding it from my parents so that sucks but whatever, I'm taking my own steps!"
depression,Why do non depressed people just say 'be happy',"Why do they expect that to work? Some of them are like ""be happy and stop using depression as an excuse"""
depression,I am always crying and I get easily emotionally drained.,"I am considering if I should seek medical help again, but I am also afraid to hear people say that I am just pretending or being overreactive. I just don't understand why I internalized a lot of things I read, I hear, I see, a lot of things that are happening around me. I am trying to act normal, but they still get into me.

I am also considering that maybe I am just under pressure right now because I am reviewing for an exam, but I am not feeling well inside my head. I always get distracted, I always feel like I need to rest, and I always get this feeling of being alone and I don't want this anymore.

I always end up feeling bad and sorry. I sincerely hate how crying has become a habit these days. I badly want to escape from this or at least I just want to feel better. Last time, I was able to secretly get an teleconsult appointment with a psychiatrist through a government institution, but now I don't know how to and I can't because I still don't have the privacy to do so. We transferred to a different home now and I am now farther to any drug store; in case I need to take meds again, I don't know how I can buy them secretly. I already graduated, so i don't have access to our university medical assistance. I feel so helpless no matter how hard I try."
depression,i want to kill myself because i'm so dumb,i'm tired of trying. i keep trying and trying and trying to learn but i still can't learn anything. i try to focus but i still don't understand anything. i'm too fucking dumb i want to kill myself. i'll never achieve my dreams because of how dumb i am. i don't even improve on anything. i always fail and i never do good. i hate myself so much
depression,I want to die but can’t,"I’m depressed as shit and do not want to keep going. Everything is supposed to be ok right now I go to work everyday and get fucked up with friends on the weekend. I can’t kms though. My entire family is full of mental illness so is my friend group. If I did it I’m worried it would start a chain reaction of this shit. I wake up everyday and deal with the constant battle going on in my head and I keep it from everybody just to make sure no one else has to suffer because of me. But it’s getting harder and harder and ion know what to do. Every time I try to talk to my gf about it her response is usually “mhm, damn, I’m sorry” ion know what I’m expecting her to say but I feel like it shouldn’t be that. Talking to a wall lmao."
depression,I’m almost there,I started cutting again last night. The times I’ve cut in the past we’re always proceeded by regret and shame. Not this time. This time I was almost happy. Happy because the fact that I’m cutting again means that I’m finally making steps in the right direction. I’m making steps towards finally killing myself. Finally ridding the world of the massive burden and failure that is me. I’m going to swing by Home Depot sometime today and buy a rope. I’m going to need it soon.
depression,Music's effects,[removed]
depression,I cried for the first time in like 5 years today,"Im 19 and about to study in a foreign country and due to my depression I am putting huge pressure onto my family because I am having an incredibly hard time deciding and make up horrendous scenarios in my head. For example that I will fail, never meet new people and stay isolated and broke forever. My depression has been prevalent since I was little and it was diagnosed in 2017. Ive been taking zoloft since 2020.

I often doubted myself, messaging my parents in the middle of the night that I will go to a smaller university in my hometown to feel safer but on the inside I know that I cant miss out on this experience. I live together with my 27 year old sister and she is going through some problems as well. When she is sad I am sad as well. My sister often yells at me to get my act together and toughen up which is part tough love and part painful but it is what it is.

Today I went outside a little since I isolated myself here for so long. My father called me and asked how I am doing and how he and my mother will support my decision even if it does not work out. That really teared me up and I rarely show any emotion to not look weak in front of anybody."
depression,Tolerance Break?,So about a year ago after taking cirpralex for 5 years it stopped working so my doctor and I tried a bunch of different medications that didn't end up working or even made things worse. So after a couple of months I decided to go back on to cipralex to see if it would help me like it use to and it has. Has anyone else ever gone through a tolerance break with a medication that has worked for you in the past?
depression,I'm scared to go on holiday,"Over 3 years ago I had work abroad, awesome friends and a okay life. But eventually I went into the wall and ended up in a deep depression because of trauma that I hadn't processed before.

Fast forward today 3 years later I haven't been abroad at all. Obviously corona came in-between as well, but also my depression. But I've felt like I've gotten my depression under good control so I thought I would go on a holiday as it was a long time since last. Just to clear my mind and see something different.

It's only a short trip of 4 days but more then enough. But for some reason I'm doubting about going or not. And I can't really say why, there's something scary with it, I'm not sure if it's how it all ended 3 years ago. Or if it's that I'm going to a city where I left things unsolved in a way.

I want to go to UK. I used to live there, but this wasn't the last placed I lived abroad. UK has always been a place where I've felt welcomed at. And I left things very abruptly and it felt like going there to close doors for myself but also have a holiday and go to York etc would be good.

Is it wrong of me? Or is it just normal travel anxiety and once I'm going it will feel better?"

depression,I'm afraid to take Seroquel,"At the start of the year I began taking 20 mg Lexapro &amp; 150 mg Welbutrin.

Got a new insurance provider and had to start up with a new psychiatrist today.

I told her that I am in a much better state than I used to be I still feel pretty depressed and also have trouble sleeping.

She ended up prescribing 50 mg of seroquel in addition to what I am already taking.

Now that I have done a bit of research I am TERRIFIED to take it, lol. The massive amounts of weight gain, the link to diabetes, potential for tardive dyskinesia...

A year ago I was at a point where I felt like literally any side effect that could happen to me would be better than the hell I was living in. Now? Not so much. But I am afraid to tell my doctor this. Like, can I tell her ""nevermind. I'd rather just stay a little depressed""?"
depression,idk what to do any more.,"I (24)F can't really turn to my partner/fiancee (26)m and talk about how down I'm feeling. This weekend marks the 3 year anniversary to me witnessing my father's suicide on my birthday, I know most people would be excited for this birthday, but mine is just a reminder of the most traumatic day of my life, and when I get thoughts of ""I wish he pulled the trigger on me like he had planned""  or that I wish I had the balls my dad did to just give up, or what ever. And he gets angry at me and yells at me to ""shut up, and stop talking like this"", I understand it's not something you want to hear from your partner, but he doesn't try to comfort my hurt or bring me back down like most people would do, I have been in therapy for this, it's just worse around this time of year. 

I just feel truly alone, like I don't have any one outside of my therapist to turn to about this stuff. I feel like recently things are just falling apart for me, and I can't turn to him, the person who claims they wanna spend their life with me, who can I turn to? What do I do? I just need support or some one to listen to me when I feel this way. With out immediately yelling at me for feeling this way. He claims he understands and he feels like ""un-aliving"" himself too, but if I were to react to him saying these things the way he did, it would be completely unacceptable. 

I honestly don't know what I'm expecting to get back about this post, except maybe for feel better about getting this all off my chest, but right now I'm not okay, and idk how to tell him without him getting upset."

depression,Stuck,"I feel like for years I've been stuck in a moment, and I just want to be unstuck. I still remember it. I was in the car, going home after taking a university entrance exam. I remember the view, which side I was on the car. What he said, the tone of his voice. 

When I let my mind wander, I am there again. It plays over and over in my head like a broken record. Sometimes I feel nothing of it. Sometimes I cry until I'm out of breath. I try to focus on other things, but in the end im still stuck.Time hasn't moved properly for awhile now because I'm still there.

Ever since then I've just regressed as a person. Less social, isolated myself. Made no new friends ever since I entered university. Lost contact with old friends, why bother with someone like me. Panic attacks. Im a cripple physically, i cant even walk normally until now.

Somehow I was still functioning academically, I have no idea how but I've been a deans lister for the past 5 trimesters which is considered stellar. But I don't feel stellar. I feel like a fraud among my batchmates. An alien. Next academic year is starting and I still feel burnt out from lthe ast term. 

I have a very strong urge to neglect all my responsibilities and just curl up in my bed and sleep forever. But I know I'm not going to. I don't want to waste my parents money.

I'm just so tired and lonely and have no idea how to fix it. There is just nothing in my life I look forward to. Im a fake. I want to give up."
depression,Today I found out I have serve depression and other serious mental health issues facing me up.,"I went to take a physiological test because my mental health been getting worse. I feel absolutely worthless, I seriously think sometimes I would be better off dead. I have a habit of mentally self-harming as well as cutting.

 My life is horrible and small jobs like putting my clothes on the line feel so much harder. Somedays I don't feel like I have the energy to do anything even though I've eaten, drunk enough water, slept for the recommended time I still feel tired. I often don't sleep well and get up like 5 times at night. I cry myself to sleep more often than not. 

My whole life has been effected for a long time. Everything is effected. I have turned pessimistic and negative and people do notice. Therapy does help a bit but not too much yet(just started a few months ago tho)

I try to work on my hobbies and it takes my mind of it for a while but feeling of the deep pit of emptiness and despair always returns. My therapist says I may have to go on drugs as well if therapy doesn't go that well. 

I don't know if I'll ever be content with my life, I just want someone to relate to me and give me advice. Thank you."
depression,Depression or personality type,"For as long as I can remember my baseline mood has been fairly apathetic alternating with periods (1 day or so at a time) in which I'm motivated and optimistic.

But now, i live in south korea, and as you expect i don't know korean at all, like basic level. Even below

You would say that I'll learn with time, but i have reached my limits, it'd lika a cap, i can't go pass it, not in any subject, nor math (which i was good at) nor science nor anything, i don't think someone like me can graduate
My grades went from A to E ir even H that's how bad i am.

And the buggest part is probably my relationships with parents, long story short, we have not the best relationship which kinda stresses me out.
And recently i got diagnosed with depression and really bad social anxiety

You might think that I'm overwhelmed by moving in korea, kinda?
But since i moved here 3 years have passed, and depression is getting only worse and worse, i might gonna need help"
depression,is this deserved?,[removed]
depression,I’m 19 and I I find it extremely hard to even try and talk to anyone. Better I should just die now.,"I don't know, I don't even know what to say here in all honesty. I've been alone for so long I can't even talk to anyone. Not even just romantic loneliness (I've never been loved) but loneliness in general. I don't even have friends.

I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship. Not to mention I'm high-functioning autistic, so yeah there's that...

I’ve tried everything in person dating apps I get the numbers and then they just ghost me. I look around and see couples holding hands cuddling and so on and I just come back to my place alone and I’m  thinking of ending it soon not because"

depression,loneliness will kill me,"Little rant sorry
Hello, weird thing to say but I want my depression to get worse and consume me till I can't take it. I've had the push through anything mentality for years,. I know one must suffer to find peace and happiness but suffering is my entire life. There's no one in my life, I can die in bed and not a tear would be shed for me. The life of working to pay bills and then come home to nothing is retarded. Years spent trying to make just 1 friend and nothing. Loneliness will be my killer not me. Why suffer for nothing, I get if you have kids or something that makes you want to get better but I got nothing. 
The one thing to save me would be having just ONE friend but my efforts to make on have failed. Just having someone would be enough to make me stay."
depression,I think kms is the best thing I could do for me rn,"So, rationally speaking and leaving all emotions aside. I have no emotional reason to end my life, by which I mean that it's not something I thought about on a whim, but why continue? 

I am turning into a bitter, lonely human being and I know how my life will be, I've known for some time now and if you're me, it's really not that hard to predict. 

I was not crying when I started writing this but I am now, not at the thought of ending my life but at the thought of living it like this. I am more terrified of continuing this grey, useless life than of death."
depression,How do I bounce back?,"Back in September/October I went through one of the worst battles of depression in my life. I was very close to attempting suicide for a second time. I gained almost 40lbs and I completely lost who I once was. This lasted till April of this year. I feel im slowly climbing out of the hole. Im maturing. Im growing. I’ve lost almost 30lbs and I kicked a bad pornography addiction. I am just over all making the climb out of the suicidal rut I was in. Yet there’s still a big chunk of me that’s missing. I recently got into a relationship with a wonderful woman but I just don’t have the confidence and…ability (for lack of a better word) like I did before. I find myself making far more mistakes, being more insecure, and being unable to preform as well as I used to in bed. Not only that but on an individual standpoint i just feel like im missing something of myself. Im sorry if this doesn’t make sense. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated as I am fearful I’ll slip back into that really bad place."
depression,In a new city &amp; some good things are happening but I can’t help but want to kms.,"Im sitting here in a new city , in my first apartment ever. I should be happy but I just want to end it all. Im not going to because I probably won’t do it correctly and I’ll end up with more ugly wrist scars or brain damage…. But I’m just thinking about it. 


Why can’t I just be happy? Why am I so miserable?… I think it’s because I’m just so trusting of people and keep getting fucked over. I’m an idiot who loves everyone and I need to stop…. Idk….. I just think life here isn’t for people like me. 

I spent like an hour reading posts on the sanctioned suicid3 site…. But like I just don’t have the courage to end it. Maybe bc part of me is Optimistic shit will get better?…. But at the end of the day… what is the point of all of this?…. We are all going to die alone anyways."
depression,Invisibly Empty,"I’ve never posted to Reddit, I never post anywhere but at this point I don’t know where else to go. 32/m diagnosed with major depression since 16 and adhd since around 18. 

I did therapy in my teens and have finally made decision to give it another shot, but needed to put something in writing. 

I’ve denied to myself and my loved ones how numb I’ve become. I’ve always been easily sucked into the dark side of my mind, I think it’s become a familiar comfort to fall into despair. I’m afraid most that the cycle of depression and anxiety has become inseparable from my self identity. I’m not sure if I know who I am without that part of myself.

The rest of the world sees me as a quiet guy who’s happily married to a phenomenal wife, two beautiful kids aged 1 &amp; 4, financially doing great, killing it at work, great parents, great friends…. Reading this sub I feel guilty even posting here knowing the blessings I have.

All I see in the mirror each day is a workaholic and neglectful husband, absentee dad, forgetful friend and family member, and overall selfish person. Somehow I also turn that self criticism into being a victim which does not help the negative way I view myself.

My daughter at 7 months old recently went through an aggressive brain infection that landed her in the hospital for a month. She could’ve died, it was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. I must’ve made a hundred deals with god trying to trade my life for hers. She’s home and healthy which is literally a miracle I’ll never understand. 

all of a sudden I went from sleeping nights at the hospital, drive home and  work 15 hours a day, breaking down every minute I was alone in fear, hiding that from my son and family, 7 days a week for a month. Then one day she comes home and the world goes back to normal.

I’ve never felt so alone, helpless, desperate. Then, it was over and people talk about it when it comes up like it was a bad bout of flu. I was already at my breaking point mentally and emotionally but I will never forget the feeling of isolation while she was going through that.

I feel like all I want to do all the time is vent to someone, but feel no one actually cares. When someone does, I only feel guilty for burdening them and regret it after. Those I do lean on either have betrayed my confidence or seem uninterested. I work more hours than I thought possible to provide for my family, yet feel like I’m never enough for either.

All day every day I feel fake. I just don’t know how much longer I can pretend. I’ve been through my fair share of shit in life, but also realize it’s nothing compared to most and I am grateful for what I have yet feel I don’t deserve it. Lately I just feel like I’ve run out of people that actually care to hear about my life let alone ask how I’m doing.

I feel isolated, I’m doing the things I always had on the priority list for life, but with each achievement just feel more and more alone. I feel the last 15 years has been a slow spiral and no one really sees how close I am to falling off the edge at any given time. 

I should be happy but I’m not and don’t V even know what that means anymore. I don’t know how much longer I can keep up the act, but also don’t have a choice but to deal with it. i feel like I’ve been on the brink of a mental breakdown for over a decade, but my kids and wife gave me a reason to suffer through what previously were more dangerous thoughts. I can accept that and won’t give up like that even if only for them.

 I just wish i could remember the feeling when I was younger and thought those around me actually gave a shit about how I was doing. I get how that sounds, but can’t shake the feelings that I know it’s truth.

I used to be full of hope, optimism, idealism, passion…now I just feel empty. A machine only as good as it’s productivity who’s random cries for help are tolerated until it breaks once and for all and no longer is useful. 

I’m always tired. Always feel out of place. Always on a different wavelength. Always just a bit off. Always inadequate. Always feel separate, unsure, insecure. I’m just exhausted and feel out of places to turn. 

If you read this, thanks for listening to me ramble. This sub has helped me realize I’m maybe not as alone as I thought, hopefully my thoughts can do the same for someone else."
depression,Ever thought about killing yourself... no I mean,I have thought of this everyday of my life for the last 5 years I'm 21 now and  have literally seemed to have hit rock bottom I have been fighting it so long but the last two weeks it seems everything in me has drained out and I will be sitting in my car on my break from my shit job at 3am and I'll just start getting bombarded with all these thoughts of how I should do it and have lost that feeling when your thinking of taking your life that gravitates you away. I don't think this life is worth it anymore the pain the stress and the thoughts in my head will be the end of me. Just needed somewhere to say this.....

depression,any tips for not feeling so empty and negative even though i have a lot going for me?,"
i am 16 and im diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i have a ton of stuff going for me in that i have super supportive (although not always understanding) parents and a good therapist and mentor. i have a couple friendships but usually they never seem to last more than a couple months and if they do then it just makes me bored bc theres only so much you can talk about before it starts feeling forced. it makes me seem like a bad person but thats just how it is. ive been hospitalized 4? times and none of them really helped. i always go back to how i am feeling now. empty and suicidal. music soothes and comforts me but it cant help me overcome extremely negative thinking. school is coming up and idk if ill be able to handle it. i dont want any cliché bs that ive heard before either. i want something that can actually help me feel a bit fulfilled. also u ask me anything if u need/want more info."
depression,I’m addicted to sexting and can’t stop,"Just typing this makes me feel like a manwhore. I spend a lot of time on the cumtributes and TributeMe subs, sending cock and cum tributes to women who ask for them. I really enjoy doing it but the problem is that I can’t stop at all. I wake up at 3AM to see if there is any woman online looking for a cumtribute. I’m a slut who needs to cum on women’s pictures and show it to them. I need validation that way. When I saw that they enter the chat but they don’t reply I worry about if they might find that my cock is too small or I don’t cum enough. I always have to ask them if they like it or not. How do I get a grip of myself?"
depression,Today was my birthday,[removed]
depression,I don’t know if I have depression and Idk how to seek help,"I’m 18F, and I think I have depression. I have never sought out professional help bc my family would shame me for it bc mental health is extremely stigmatized in my community. In high school I never planned on going to college bc I didn’t want to live past 18. Then by some miracle, I got accepted into this program at my state university. Seeing how proud my parents were, that gave me a reason to stay. Now I recently got a job related to this major and a sense of doubt is settling in. I feel like the initial joy/pride, whatever you want to call it, died after my first year of college and now all I can feel is anxiety, panic and dread for the future. So what if I got the job? So what if I will graduate? So what if I find success in my career? I don’t want to do anything. The only thing that truly gives me comfort is sleep and video games, if I’m being honest. And nowadays, sleep is the only thing I can do. I don’t want to work, to get married, to have children, to be an adult, to do anything. I don’t want to go out either. I used to love the idea of traveling the world, but now idec for that anymore. Now I just want to hide from the world. 

Before anyone comes for me, I hate that I’m this way. I want my doctor to give me meds, something, anything, to change and rewire my brain and make me happy. I have no money for therapy and I don’t want my parents to find out either. Sometimes I wish I could just go peacefully in my sleep but that’s too much to wish for I guess."
depression,sad,I think it’s better for them to not know everything. Like if my mood is down and they want to know *why* just to go back to whatever they’re doing I won’t give them any answer. I’m just going to keep a couple of things to myself. I don’t have anyone else so it’s best for me to come on here and vent. I’m just better off alone…
depression,I'm so selfish,"Currently in my life I have it all that sould make me happy. I have a fiancé, a son, a house and a decent job. Unfortunately, I've left myself unmedicated for the longest time and as a guy i dont have much people I'd turn to. The two years of lockdown probably brought me to this as i worked long hours all from home with government restrictions on what businesses could open or not. On Friday I tried to take my own life after weeks of putting it off. 

I'm currently in an inpatient facility and I feel even worse now. What a selfish cunt I am for even thinking all of this and to even attebpy to go through with it. I'm not better, but on reflection I'd never want to hurt my family. Why am I like this? How did I let it get this far?

Anyway, I'm saying this here as I don't want to address the 'why' with my family yet on this topic. They know I'm here currently and even visit, but I'm so ashamed that they're so supportive to a piece of shit like me."

depression,I don’t know what to do anymore,I’m still pretty young I’ll be 16 in September. I feel so lonely half the time. I have bipolar depression. I’m not in the best shape but I’m not super fat. I just don’t have self confidence or hope for the future. I’m not as suicidal as I was but I still think about it. I just moved so I don’t have access to in person contact with my friends. All I’ve done is drink and smoke to keep myself occupied so I don’t start having those thoughts. I just want a girlfriend or friend in general who actually cares about me and wants to hear about my day. I feel like I am the odd one out with my family. My brother doesn’t speak to me my sister is in collage and my mother switches from fine to angry in an instant. My father is a former army soldier who is now strung out and going to jail for a hit and run. Life is just hard. Nothing keeps me happy. I just need some guidance since I haven’t been able to talk to my therapist who is going through chemotherapy
depression,weird feeling,"i feel okay with my looks but then i wanna just mutilate my face.. even if its okay. like… i feel pretty yet ugly at the same time????? and either way just makes me wanna tear my face off idk

like this is on my mind all the time and its been an extra big problem recently and i sometimes just start to freeze up and the urge overwhelms me, thankfully havent done anything yet lol"
depression,I have this feeling that I just wanna be dead.,"I read this quote by Murakami which said “Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.”

I cannot see a better way to describe this feeling. I don't wanna kill myself really but I do feel like hurting myself sometimes. I've never done it but I think I've come pretty close at times. I just wanna disappear for a while I guess... or for eternity. Or maybe I don't wanna die but I just wanna be dead."
depression,Need help,"I was diagnosed with depression few years ago. I was on medication for a year until the doctor stopped it as he thought I didn't need it. When college started after pandemic, I started feeling anxious all the time so I consulted psychiatrists. When that didn't work I went to the psychologist I saw before. She told me to try few things. They worked and now I don't feel anxious. But I am not still happy. And it's all my fault. It seems like I don't want to be better. I talk to others, I go to doctors but I don't work on getting better. I don't know what to do. I see no future for myself. I'm not suicidal but for now living seems pointless. I want to want to get better but it's been this way for years."
depression,Wife says she is depressed because of me,"So in addition to having anxiety and depression so bad that every day I wish a meteor would land on me, and the fact that the one parent I have left is about to die, my wife admitted that at least part of the reason she is so depressed is because of me.  Apparently I am such a loser that it makes her unhappy.  It makes me want to tell her to go on ahead and GTFO then but we have two young kids.  I feel like she should go ahead and stand over on the side of all the other people who told me that I was nothing, and a loser.  I probably am not making much sense right now but I am in a very difficult place right now and this was a kick in the nuts.  I am pissed."
depression,I feel like I live for everyone else,"I've suffered from depression for my entire life, I'm on the autism spectrum and need help with the most basic of tasks. 
I constantly feel like I have to live for everyone else and get no fulfilment out of anything that interests me.

I've tried so many different medications, therapies, psychologists, changes in diet, exercise, the works but no matter what I feel like I am not going anywhere. 

I feel alone in the world even if I do have loving friends, I have a terrible fear of losing them, like I bother them just by being around them.
I forget everyone has a life and doesn't have time to talk 24/7 but it really feels like the world is ending when one of my peers lives their life when I struggle to do that myself.

I think about death mostly every day, I couldn't ever take my own life however if I was to die I wouldn't fight it.
I just don't like living and I don't like the responsibility of being an adult, I imagine nobody does but the world is so overwhelming and I'm scared of it.

Sorry if this is all inappropriate, I need to get it off my chest."

depression,been offered a Project Manager role for a new firm but,"I just can't bring myself to take it. The pay is very good with a company car but my anxiety, depression and brain fog is just stopping me from taking it. In my current state I know I wouldn't last more then 3 months.

I have zero PM skills and I come from a mechanical engineering background (working in aviation) which I hate and stuck with for 9 years until I started having panic attacks in the work toilets 2-3 times a day due to mistakes I kept making constantly. I left this job 6 months ago still unemployed but have had job acceptance for low end engineering roles but my mind has a breakdown everytime I land one and I never accept.

I feel like I hate engineering that much that I just can't stand working in the field as I know I'll creep into a darker place with my depression and anxiety.

I have had time to reflect on what I would like to do and that is IT but trying to land a entry level role with zero experience is non-existent.

Anybody that's switched careers into IT give a little help? I'm thinking I should find a temp job in anything to pay my mortgage whilst doing countless amounts of online courses and boot camps. I just want to do something I enjoy instead of being false around people that are nothing like me talking about their modded shitbox cars all-day.

Sorry about the length but just needed to get it off my chest before I blow..."
depression,I can't love my boyfriend anymore,"So I female have been with this guy for 7months and I hate him...

I care about him but I just don't wanna look at him anymore after the amount of jealousy he has he got mad at me for being to close to my female friend bc we don't the whole fake gay thing just like guys (he does it with his friends too) 

Back in march I was SA'ed and all he did was break up with me and i couldn't even look at myself in the mirror I feel so gross and he said he'd take me back after 3 days of fighting he didn't even mention the guys name once it was all me 

Anytime i tried to leave he threatens suicide and drags fights out for up to 4 hrs over a simple outfit accusing me of wanting another man's attention he hates when I hang out with friends with out him 

Once when I didn't respond to him for 3 hours he blew up at Me and said I ruined his night when he ruined mine bc that night was the first time jn months I didn't see me mom over 9+ months with out a women I an very close to 

He tells me I'm a shit girlfriend and once went on a rant for 15 minutes on how great his ex was and all I could do was apologize everyone says I should leave even his best friend I don't even say I have a boyfriend most of the time anymore 

I'm falling in love with another person and I'm to scared to to leave...

Am I the asshole"
depression,Parents,"So, I recently told my parents about my depression, after a good or so year, hoping that they could help me or give me advice. Instead, they proceeded in telling me that I don't have any reason to be depressed, and how other people were much more unfortunate. 

Wow. Who knew parents could be this supportive?"

depression,I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it,"I’ll be blunt and get straight to the point. I got out of a two year relationship four months ago now and a lot of thing happened during and free the relationship. I managed to get over the break up and what not but recently I found out that my ex has found someone new and this is something I’m experiencing for the first time. Having put all that time, money and effort in and giving all the care and love a man possibly could meant nothing because in the end I’ve been replaced. I know that I shouldn’t let it get to me but I’ve extremely  depressed and I had gotten through it once but idk if I can this time. I loved her dearly and idk I’m in so much pain in unbearable. The worst part of it all is that I’m the one that let her go because I not only was going through my own things but I knew it would be better for her in the long run. I just need help from anyone at this point."
depression,Day in and day out,[removed]
depression,I can’t keep going anymore,"I’ll get straight to the point. I got out of a two year relationship four months ago. Now although I managed to get over the breakup eventually I recently learned that my ex has found someone new. This for me is a new experience I’m trying to deal with since I’ve never been in this situation before but I don’t think I’m doing a good job if I’m being honest. It just hurts so much because I still care about her and love her but at the same time I have no right to since I was the one that let her go. I did it for a good reason and that was so that she could move on from me and meet someone better because I knew I wasn’t the one for her. But anyways now I’m here, extremely depressed and lonely with no one to talk about this with. Idk if anyone has any advice or anything but if I’m being honest I went through some pretty bad depression once and barely made it out so idk if I’m going to make it out this time."
depression,one hell after another,"I'm 21/m btw and I'm the kind of person who always tries to look strong no matter what hell they are in and will never ask for help and rarely vent to others. Not good at keeping personal diary or stuff so seeing some people venting here made me think maybe i can just type it all down and set it lose on strangers i never met nor will.
So this last year has been sort of one hell after another.  
Met a girl online. Fell head over heals for her and she said the same.It was all innocent love. Not even close to anything dirty or sexual since we only met and interacted over online and through texts.I'm mostly shy around girls since i never interacted with any throughout school and college so meeting someone online was ideal for me in that way. Someone naive as me who believed if you give someone all your love and care and never asked anything in return maybe things would result in an happy ever after got a rude awakening when the ""I love you too"" replies stopped coming. Even though she was the first to say it i guess i fell for it 'cause it was all new to me.
Welp she has stayed on my mind for like almost an year now with me questioning myself that why would someone even do this but i stay strong without cursing her and just accepting that i was the dumb one.
Moving on earlier this year my father passed away. I was there holding his hand when he passed. I didn't shed a single tear through out everything even though i wanted to just because i had to stay strong for my family. Now i feel like even my tears have gone dry. I don't tell anyone but it's a lot like a LOT. Well due to this i had to take a sort of break from studies so i can take over Dad's businesses. Watcing all my classmates and friends graduate,being social having girlfriends is a whole other existential crisis i get every day.Although i do plan on continuing my studies next year after i'v gotten a better grip on the bussines and have it more streamlined. 
I'm still trying my best but i'm also getting tired. I just keep strong for my families sake so that they have someone they can look too as being firm and strong and someone the can lean on.
Bunch of other stuff happened too like fam drama. Logoun ki asliyat sach mayn tub he nazar aati hay jub ghar mayn barra nahi rehta is a fact.
All in all it feels like i haven't slept in ages. My mind is in a constant state of being over clocked as in i have to be blasting music always to drown out my thoughts. 

Lonely but won't do anything about it. In pain but can't show it. Tired but can't stop. Hurt but can't heal.

WOW you actually made it this far.Thanks for reading i guess and sorry for this sucker punch of depressing stuff. The point of all this is not to look for sympathy or anything like that. Its just a way for me to vent to someone without actually venting to someone IYKWIM."
depression,An erasure of persona.,"Left a relationship that was deeply meaningful to me in many ways, despite the fact that it was, perhaps, equally destructive... and I find myself coming to grips with a new reality, a reality where I am much more fragmented than I previously was.

I'm not sure if there is any way to feel whole again; wholeness feels like a lie, a myth, something I keep perpetuating in my mind to only dissuade the slow, creeping sludge of negativity that seems to be swallowing me each passing day.

I think the worst part of this is how indifferent I feel to the transformation. I can't speculate on what a soul could be but if I have one, it must be disintegrating into the stark apathy of whatever this fresh hell has mired me into.

I'm tired of time being the bandage, the salve. Time isn't healing me. Time is just another circle of hell where I find more things to turn over and cut myself upon. Maybe one day I'll find some way to feel differently... but until then, I suppose, I'll endure each day like I did the last; barely."

(13 M btw). today a kid at school was pushing me around a bit. this is normally something id shrug off, but today it felt like something erupted inside of me. all that built up anger exploded and ended up hurting him really bad. it just wasnt me. i feel like *more* of a worthless piece of shit than usual and now i want to die, because i dont know whether this is gonna happen again, and i dont want to hurt anyone anymore, and im done with the pain"

depression,Oral hygiene,I have been going through a depressive episode and haven’t been able to take proper care of my teeth. I don’t want to get gingivitis or something like that. Does anyone have anything that could help?
depression,It's so hard to ask for help.,"I have battled with depression before and I have been through therapy and then I got better. 

That was 4 years ago. Now I am in a worse situation. I will always feel that I will never get rid of this illness however hard I try. Maybe therapy once again will help me but only for some time, eventually I will fall back into it in 4-5 years time. And it's so expensive in my country, I can't even afford it. All I need is someone to talk to and that is the main problem. 

My friends are the best people in my life and I love them more than anyone and they also love me. Last time, I think more than the professional help or anti-depressants, their support made me better. When I told them what I was going through, they called me regularly to check up on me, listened to my cries, rants, and my thoughts. I am grateful to them more than anyone. But at that time, we were in college so we had time for each other. 

Now we live in different cities, some even in different country. All of us have our own separate lives and all of us are busy. We talk with each other as much as we can, but that's like once in 2 months or so. I cannot tell them how bad I am once again. I don't want to put them in such a position. They are busy with their careers and I can't be one to ask them to take time out for me, because I cannot be so needy. I don't want them to listen to me when I know that they have problems of their own. They are living away from their families, alone in a strange city with not too many friends; I know everyone of them battles daily with a lot of issues. I cannot burden them with my own problems.

Everyday I am spiraling deeper and deeper in this hell. My sleep cycle is fucked, my appetite is ruined, I have lost interest in my hobbies, I don't ever feel like talking about myself to my family because living in denial is much easier than facing their concerns. 

It's so easy for me to fake normalcy when I know inside me is a void. People cannot see the what anyone is going through. I just wish I had someone to talk to."
depression,nothing is working,"absolutely everything seems overwhelming.

i feel unloved.

i fight this mental battle in my head 24/7.

i can't sleep.

everything in my life is not working.

i'm really not sure why i keep typing all of this crap out to random people.

i've been in this state nearly all of my life."
depression,What Needs to Change?,"For a long time I've thought that the solution I was looking for was a major life change. I've accomplished a goal that I set out to do but I still have this feeling of emptiness that has been here for as long as I can remember. I remember the first time that I realized what this was. I remember thinking that this isn't something someone who has the privileges that I do can experience. I denied it and took the course of convincing myself that it's not that bad. That there are people who have it worse. 

I constantly question what the point of any of this is. I've been covering up this thing that has been weighing me down. I've always felt like this is something I'm not allowed to talk about. Like this is something someone like me should be able to put up with. You still have parents, crazyparty. You have a great future, crazyparty. You can get through this just think positively, crazyparty. These are all things I've heard repeatedly.

The most recent way this shadow has effected me was when I was at work. I helped someone fill out a government form online. I knew that they needed a confirmation page. I suggested they save the confirmation page before they left, and they were flippant about it. I know that should have insisted upon it. I didn't care. I let them leave without it. I know this is out of character for me. This depression is what created the person that let them leave and then come back to do the online form all over again just for the confirmation document. It was more work for me and I knew what I had to do to get it right the first time, but on the surface I didn't care. I wanted to get back to my work computer to distract myself with the game I was playing so I can stop thinking.

I have difficulty socializing. I have trouble eating and sleeping. I'll go the entire day without eating. I've started eating 8 to 10 hours after I wake up most days the past few years. I constantly feel like the people around me wish I were gone. I don't feel comfortable reaching out to the people I normally would (I guess what I said earlier illustrates why). I want to get help. I need to get help. I've never been on medication for this but I think that it's time. I'm scared to see the doctor. In the past I've ended up in the hospital or in a psych ward due to this issue compounding with other mental illness. I don't understand how or why I've been this way for so long but I cannot take it anymore. Thanks for listening."
depression,It’s Weird,"I feel like a part of my brain stopped functioning at some point. I stopped have suicidal _**feelings**_ but I still have suicidal thoughts very often. I’m on auto pilot 24/7, every action I make just doesn’t feel like me. The things I hear just passes through my ears directly without going through my brain, it’s almost like I lost my brain somehow. The only thing I can feel is anger and nothing else. Is this normal or am I going insane"

depression,i only feel happy when i eat :(,it's basically the only thing that gives me pleasure any more. i eat and feel 'happy' for 5 minutes and then i go back to bed and just wait until i can eat again. it's pathetic. even spending time with people i love doesn't come close to how i feel having an ice cream or something. it's a viscous cycle because im depressed because i have body dysmorphia but i love food too much and then i hate my body even more and feel more depressed. i wish i was one of those people who loses their appetite when they're depressed but instead i want to eat everything in sight to fill the void. idk what to do i just feel so hopeless :(
depression,Graduation Depression,"Am I the only one feeling this kind of graduation depression? or has anyone felt this feeling, how did you deal with it? is it separation anxiety or am I just overthinking things up?! Like after graduation, what happens? Look for a job and work just to survive? I hate that I live in an unprivileged family. Growing up with nothing and no channel to explore my potentials. I didn't developed any talents resulting to no passion. I don't have any talents nor passions to make out a living. I used to hate those grumpy adults having no life but I see myself turning into one. I feel numb and no motivation to start my days. like I have nothing to look forward to. I forgot how to have fun and I see no new opportunities. Is my soul slowly dying?"

depression,Feeling low cause trans (or because of how I'm treated by cis people),"I went to a kink/poly meeting this week where a man told me he wouldn't pay for his trans daughter's hormones and he thinks it's a phase and a choice.

I'm trans and a girl so obviously his comments made me feel sick and I was in shock and completely dissociated. While he... laughed at what he was saying?

I posted on the meeting's page that I was upset by some comments I heard at this meeting. I didn't name him. He (convincingly) came in the thread and called me a liar and a fantasist who ""heard what she wanted to hear."" I said I'm not a liar but some people sided with him while others messaged me privately to side with me. So now there's public humiliation where I'm being described as overemotional and unforgiving, on top of feeling just... rejected/hurt.

It's all so silly. I don't know this man but he affected me so much. I've called my mom about it. I've spoken to friends about it, and I still don't feel any better. I've heard every variation, ""he's an idiot, you can't fix stupid"" and ""I'm so sorry this happened to you,"" and I still don't feel any better.

I was rocking back and forth in bed this morning at four am because I felt so hurt. I've felt like detransitioning. I've felt like I made myself a target by transitioning.

These comments when you're trans and don't really think about it that much, really get under your skin. I'm feeling suicidality, although I put all the sharp objects away and took my antidepressants so I'm betting on ideation remaining ideation.

I feel bad for his daughter. I feel bad for myself having to sit there and fake smile because I was afraid to say anything. I just feel so dejected.

I feel like I need support but I'm not even sure what the person could say that would be helpful.

Pray for me idk 💀"

depression,I pricked my finger with a tweezer. Any risk of infections?,"Hello. 

37 days ago, I had encounters with two CSWs. I used protection.

I'm not sure but I might have taken my black sanitation bag with me, which contained my tweezers, to those escorts' houses.

During 35-36 says, I didn't use that tweezer. But two days ago, I used it to pull out a splinter on my finger, and I used it very harshly and made my finger bleed.

Now, my question is:

If somehow, that tweezer got infected with a virus, std, etc., What kind of infections am I in risk of getting? HIV, HPV, Chlamydia? Is this a risky situation? Is 35-36 days enough for any virus to completely die if it was on that tweezer?

Should I get tested?

Thank you."

depression,How to move forward,"Hello as the tittle states I’m at a real awful spot in my life rn. I feel like I’m paying the consequences of being depressed and drifting aimlessly through life. Im 21 very soon to be 22 I quit my food service job just last year before I turned 21 due to developing severe depression , axienty, pure ocd. 
During that time my father died randomly as well which sent me deeper into it. Here 7 months later after his death  I want to take initiative and take my life back I also feel so behind left out and alienated from my peers and old people in my life. Ik Comparison is the thief of joy but I feel like my life has stagnated since 18. 

When I was 17/18 I was proud of myself because I have learning problems that I struggled with and I managed to graduate with atleast decent grades.
I had a long-standing gf and just got a car things were so simple I had no dreams or serious aspirations though. My ex left me soon after , after 4 years through hs and I sort of stopped caring about girls still till today. And I got complacent working a regular shitty deadend Job. Now seeing my ex graduate college with her newest bf and get a “serious” job and be a real adult I’m sort of envious and bitter. And it sort of Stunts me because I’ve become self loathing and self critical. And think I deserve living at my parents , single, and being aimless some days this type of thinking makes me want to give up and contemplate suicide. 
I have no fun in my life I’d like to meet more women and start having sex again. I also want to find a career and make some sort of living despite my learning problems and education level. I’m starting to feel old and feel like time is accelerating. My depression has robbed me of any real interest or hobbies either and it’s effected my social skills as well as I’ve become closed off. Anyone that’s been at a dark part of there life and changed it I would like some advice? And learn how to over come and move on from this dark part of my life."

Actually I haven’t had a slight chance to survive the doctors told me but they did a good job and someone in heaven or somewhere else too (my whole life I always told people how lucky I am and fuck yeah this came from the bottom of my heart! and life went mostly really great). 
But boom, this life changed 180 degrees and went downhill. 

Always thought I can stand the man I was but couldn’t do hard work anymore, couldn’t do the sports I like, couldn’t go out partying and doing activities the same way, suddenly problems to get close to women, etc… 
All because I had the fear to get weak and dependent after the surgery. 
And because of this fear and being self-pity at one point, I slowly became everything I didn’t wanted to be and more. Even though I did a lot like visiting psychiatrist, doctors, etc. 
I jumped deep down this numb place with all of it’s facets called depression, this fucking parasite.

Now I believe the only way out of this numb shithole is to admit to myself that I am weak, weak for the moment. It costed me alot of courage to reveal this to others (but mostly to my broken inner self).
The journey doesn’t stop here, rather it is the start of something new the old ego tried to suppress all the time.



I think that’s how we get depressed.
The whole situation does not suit the ego (the old you)—

(Sometimes it’s definitely too much for a human, this is why it’s ok to ask for help, no matter how old you are, female or male - specialy male! - , we all need help at a certain point of life!)

-- until you admit to this situation and going to chance it.
Sometimes you need to get depressed just to internalize the life lesson you’ve got blessed with. 
Time doesn’t matter, we’re growing in our own paces. 
Hard to do in such a fast racing society but it’s worth it!

I’m at my restart now. The future is blurry, it always has been but somehow it is ok again.

Wish you all a worthwhile journey and please do not give up!"
depression,I'm self-sabotaging any attempts at having a social life because then at least I know why I don't have one,"I know a lot of people through a sports club in Uni, but no one ever really talks to me. Everyone is lovely when I meet them and often tell me they like me, on multiple occasions I've been told I'm a great person yada yada and I honestly couldn't name one person in my life that I know of that even slightly dislikes me, but, no one ever reaches out to me. It's like I have to constantly be the one making the effort. I've found, through experience, that if I don't reach out or message someone myself I'll go weeks without talking to anyone at all. My longest stint being 4 months which was nice...

When I meet up with people I must just simply be a nice but incredibly boring individual. Maybe I just don't make enough of an effort, I don't know anymore. But as far as I can tell I'm the common factor in all of this since everyone else seems to be in touch with each other. Everyone can't be an arsehole so it has to be something to do with me. It's definitely something I'm doing wrong but I don't know what or why. Now because of this going on for years I've found that I'm now actively cutting everyone off. Its like I'm working towards having no friends and just leaving everyone behind with no plans to stay in touch. Feeling alone hurts a lot at times but pain from blaming and hating myself for it is easier to deal with than the pain from not knowing why.

I guess the plan now is to just become some sort of recluse. If I'm gonna hurt may as well know the reason for it right?"

depression,Feeling depressed in a relationship - Should or shouldn't I?,"Hi guys,

I just want to get this off my chest and ask your opinion about the topic. Some of you, or maybe the most of you have already been in my situation before or have felt this way once or twice.

My problem is, that I've been in a relationship for 6+ years now with a girl I really love, I'd really want to be with for the rest of my life and want to do everything together. However, I'm not sexually attracted to her anymore. Partly because I was a late bloomer, I'm kind of that introverted type that was never OK around girls, which is the reason why I didn't have any relationship up until my mid 20's. I had a few short adventures with some girls, then got into my first relationship that lasted for half a year, and after another half year being single, I met my current girlfriend and we've been together for more than 6 years.

What I feel I'd describe as, she doesn't attract me sexually, and I still feel like I have too little experience to settle down. I was always an overweight and insecure, non-confident person, which I have changed in the last 6-10 years. Right now I feel like I could do whatever I want, with whomever I want. I feel that I could overcome this feeling and settle down, like most of my friends have already, think of having a family, a home, etc. But I can't forget the feeling, that our sex-life is very bad due to what I've mentioned earlier.

I love this girl, but the feeling that I can't move on because of how our sex-life never made me happy, and I know that it'll probably never make me happy, is making me so depressed... Meanwhile we are getting older, she is only a few years away from getting 30, which makes me feel like a douchebag, knowing that I am only wasting her time. My time as well, but I'm OK with messing up my life. I don't want to mess up hers. During the 6+ years I've never thought about marrying her, mainly because of my mixed feeling about our future, or how this relationship could come to an end... You just simply can't marry someone, only if you are 110% sure, that she IS the one.

I'm getting more and more depressed and don't know what I should do. I try to convince myself that it could work, that I could get sexually attracted to her, or more likely lose sexual attraction to other girls, and by doing so convince myself, that she is my partner for life. Based on every other aspect, I'd definitely want to marry her. But this feeling of her not being happy with me sexually, is standing in the way...

Anyways, thanks for reading through all of this...

PS.: Please don't suggest any therapy for us. I've already worked on this. Every other suggestion is welcome!"

depression,Should I cut ties with my parent? Please help me,"
Should I cut ties with my parent?

For as long as I can remember, I haven’t had the best relationship with my parent. I wont say which one, but the fact is that even if I love my parent, and absolutely admire a lot of their traits, I have an immense fear when it comes to that parent. There has never been any physical harm or anything (dont worry) however this parent has got clear anger issues. Not just against me, but most people around them. My fear has evolved, from me having an terrible self esteem because the things said to me hit home really bad, and now that I have been to therapy for around 3 years I dont have self esteem problems, but my fear is confusing now. 

My parents decided to get a divorce around 2 years ago, and it has been a nightmare. Me and my sibilings have been in the middle of it for the whole thing. We have even been witnesses at the first (and up till now, only) trial. This has been terrible for my mental health, to the point that I have attempted suicide. I am aware of the dangers of this so I decided to get extra help on the matter, and I am currently on more therapy and with a bunch of measures in place. 
About 18 months ago after a suicide attempt I told this parent whom i fear, about it. I told the parent about me having this fear, and told him I would be attending therapy. Their reaction was horrible (although I do empathize in the sense that sometimes he projects worry through anger, but Im still not justifying it). They told me I was a liar, and unfair, that I was selfish. They made an emphasis on how terrible it would have been if I succeeded because “how would I tell your other parent about this”. For a month I didnt see this parent and I was for a while out of the divorce matters. I no longer recieved the emails from lawyers and it seemed like I had finally gotten myself out of it. Until the first trial. I was put as a witness and once again I was in the middle. A few months later I traveled abroad to begin uni, and for most of the year things were really amazing. Just once, when this parent came to visit did I have to once again go through the same anger episodes. It seems like our relationship only works when Im away. I came home for the summer, came as late as I could and am leaving as esrly as I can, but as soon as I saw my parent things went downhill again. And it seems like each time its a bit worse. Comments are more hurtful and language is less censored. Questioning my manhood just because I dont want to get involved in the divorce matters, comparing me to my other parents lawyer and saying Im even worse, “lying shi*”, etc. to the point that last time I visited, I was there for less than 72 hours and my parent got mad at me 4 times. Each time my parent is mad it is at least an hour of telling off.

My parent however is someone I love, someone who has worked very hard for my family and I truly appreciate that. Clearly, there is a lot of love for my siblings and I. The reason my siblings and I have been part of the divorce (in part) is that the goods being fought for are someday going to be ours. My parent wants us to fight for “our rights” because if not, they will be taken from us, perhaps stolen by my other parent. 

I recently sent two letters to my parent, as talking face to face is just incredibly hard for me, plus as my parent may sometimes forget things, its good to have it written. I wrote the letters with all the love I have for him. I dont hate him or hold any kind of grudge against him, and I even asked someone I trust to read them over and make sure that the letters came from a place of love. In the first one, I simply asked to be left out of the whole problem, I even said I had no problem with being disowned (regardless of whether it would happen or not), because my mental health or my relationship with each parent are priceless. My parent misunderstood my letter completely and in my opinion just placed a ‘roadblock’ so I couldnt get out of the problem. I sent another one clarifying my points and saying I was not the one getting a divorce, and I love both too much to be a part of the divorce. This time around my parent simply replied something that had nothing to do with what I said, and told me that they never asked me to lie or anything, and that they just wanted my siblings and I to help guide my parents (which I dont disagree with, he did say that, but that still affected my mental health greatly). I simply did not reply to that one because silence is sometimes wise. I said all I had to say.

I love my parent but for similar reasons to mine, my parent has lost many friends and even family relationships, and of course a divorce.

However I dont know if I should cut ties with that parent. My close friends, who know about this have told me to do so, even my therapist, after 3 years of looking for ways to make my relationship with him work. I am however very scared of doing so. I know if I do, it will probably be best for my headspace, but it would maybe be permanent, or quite permanent. My parent has lost family ties and even with the other parties trying to reach out, my parent holds too many grudges to even try and fix things. Also however, since a couple of goods have been partially put to me and my sibilings name, I am afraid my life may be hard in that sense, as I will still be legally bound to that parent in some way. I also have no idea how I would phrase the letter. Recently my parent has been very nice and has told me 
they miss me and all as we havent seen each other in a few weeks. 

I dont know if I should cut ties, and if so, how do I say it? Please help me"

Hating everything about me I’ve spent years feeling this way hoping for a better tomorrow and I’m still in the same position I was in college with the stress seeing others talking having fun socialising while I’m stuck in my head I’ve took a lot of thought of myself these past days and I think ending it is not so bad after all family are distant with me except for my mother but I just doesn’t feel enough I don’t even know what I want from life or what I’m even aiming for it’s like I’m just along for this miserable ride to I eventually die I just don’t know anymore I brought a noose and I look at it as away out of this feels like the times I enjoyed living when I was a kid has just dried up and I feel like a old man like my life is just ended  What does it mean to be happy? Satisfied
depression,Been so long since I've had a romantic interest.,"Today is one of those morning where I wake up and realise I haven't had a girlfriend in over 12 years. Crazy huh? I went through my whole 20's without anyone.

I don't consider it a cause of depression as much as a result of it. At one point I was feeling depressed over girls, but at this point it's something I just get over when I think of it.

It felt worse to me to have unfulfilled romantic interests than to just be so far removed from the game that I don't even have a person in mind. I was hurting over someone in my teenage years that probably could have gone worse than it did. It still went pretty badly, but we did get together eventually and had a good year and a half with it, but that ended and it's practically impossible for me to have a relationship that fills that void. Now when I think about relationships, it's something I'd rather forget than something I'm looking forward to.

At this point, I don't think it'll ever happen again. What, am I going to start hooking up with baby mamas and divorcees when I haven't even had a girlfriend since before I turned 21? I'm not that desperate, and I don't have the maturity to handle certain aspects of adult life as-is.

I don't think I really care enough. Maybe I do just look at women 'pieces of meat'. But from my experience, that's how they look at themselves too. They know how much their lumps of fat are worth and put them out on the market for the highest price they can get for it. And that's how it is, so I don't think it's worth even trying to win one over, with all the BS that goes along with them.

I don't know, not trying to be offensive or anything. Maybe it's best to keep it to myself. I wish there was someone my age, with my level of experience, with a compatible personality and an attractive physique who is not weighed down by the baggage of children and previous relationships and plastic surgery, but it's mathematically impossible in my 30's. From now on, my attraction to the female body is no mre than a biological inconvenience than something to work towards."

I lost my happiness it took me months to realize what happened and now I'm grieving  or something like that but before that I got a boyfriend. Because I lost my support animal he became that person who give me happiness. I was in love you know that first young love but after 3 week's he broke up with me because he didn't want a relationship and wanted to hangout with he's friends more so he won't have time for me. The only thing that I didn't lost is my best friend. But she has a bf who can be kind but mostly annoying and he friend with old alcoholic homless people (normally I don't  problem if some homeless if they are a normal person).

depression,Am I faking depression?,"I'm a teenager and recently started my junior year in the same school I've been in since kindergarten. It's been hard to make new friends and I feel just so lonely. I believe I have anxiety, but I'm not diagnosed and mental health issues aren't talked about much where I'm at. Besides, it's been hard to deal with finding out my sexual identity. 

I started self harming around a month back and talked to my friends about this and that made me wonder if I really am depressed. Is talking about it normal? I feel so mad at myself cause it feels like I'm just seeking attention. So far, only around four of my closest friends know. They want me to visit the school counselor, but I don't want to do anything that risks my parents knowing. Sometimes I think about how so much more people have it way worse than me and feel guilty about feeling sad. 

Tldr; I told my friends I've been self harming and can't shake the feeling that this indicates I'm possibly doing this for attention?"

depression,The feeling of being lost,"I don't know why I'm writing this here, I just have this need to put my thoughts somewhere and this is the only thing I can think to do. I have had what I can only understand is Social Anxiety my whole life and I feel like it's a dark cloud over me. The fear, the stress, just everything.

I feel like I'm a prisoner of this thing in my brain, from my earliest years up until even now. I never understood until I was becoming an adult and falling apart, asking myself- why are you like this? I believe it's just undiagnosed autism if I'm honest, and I have more reasons for that.. but anyway...

I've always been one to avoid things, isolate myself but then hate myself for it. It's just that fear. Even now as an adult, 27 years old, it has a grip on me. Even with a family, wife and child I can't shake these feelings and this sorrow inside me. There's definitely more to it, personal failure... career failures... relationship failures- friends or family it doesn't matter. I feel no good for myself or for anyone.

I feel guilty because there are people who love me yet I feel this way. But I feel stuck- like I can't escape even if I wanted to. Because they need me."

depression,venting since I haven't done it in a while. (TW: MENTION OF NUD3S),"Recently I thought my life was getting better. I had begun to workout, eat better, got more motivation, and even found an SO. I thought everything was going fine, until my SO invited me into a group chat with his step sister. She called him by a different name than he introduced himself as (we met online and haven't met in person). Whenever we would video call, he never turned facecam on. I figured this was weird. Eventually, he left the group chat, so it was just me and his sister. I asked her if her name was what he told me. She said it was not, but they had a friend with the same name. This was extremely weird. I felt guilty about doubting him at first, but after this confirmation I began to wonder even more. I sent a video he had sent me that I thought was of him (since he claimed it was him), and asked if this was said friend. She said yes. I told her everything, how he was lying about his name, catfishing me, and lying in general. She told me that he has done this before and was actually talking to other women. She also told me that he ""flexed"" that he was only using me for pictures. I'm confused, hurt, and embarrassed. I asked his sister if he had any way to share these pictures to which she said he had little friends, and would likely just share them with her. I sent her more pictures of who the SO claimed to be, and she again confirmed it was the friend. I thought my life was finally getting back on track, but now everything just hurts. We've already broken up, and we are definitely not remaining friends. He's cheated, catfished, lied, and manipulated me. I didn't even realize it. I feel so stupid, even though it's been hours since this has happened. Looking at it now, it was so obvious that he was catfishing, I can't believe I fell for it. What's going to happen to my mental stability? Was I even becoming mentally stable? It felt nice to feel like I was wanted by someone. I think that's what helped me get back into a healthier lifestyle. However, I now know that I wasn't wanted for who I was, but for how my body is. I hate it."
depression,My ex was biker in a 1% MC. Also he was my Dom (in a D/s dynamic),"No, I won't be able to find anyone like him. He was everything over wanted. I had so much respect for him , I loved him, would have died for him :'( 

Until the day I got drunk and messed everything up. 

Inside of me I know he deserves better, and he is right about blocking me , I wasn't submissive enough for him and did something which in his club culture is unforgivable. So yes I theoretically understand these things. But how do I move on???

I don't think I can live without him. I would even settle for him to just be my friend. Just to unblock me. 

But he will never do that, because I'm unworthy of it. 

I can't fuking live like this :'("
depression,I hope I am able to finally die,"I am very tired as many of you are. I am one of those people who feel like every time I hit rock bottom, I fall deeper. No matter what. I lost the motivation to become a doctor. My career. All the hard hours I’ve put in. Not to mention I am currently employed in healthcare purely to further myself in this particular career path. Something that has caused uncontrollable anxiety. I am ashamed and unfortunately defeated. I am ashamed that I work in healthcare and often find it difficult to find the motivation to help myself. Maybe it’s because I hate myself; never learning to really like myself. Or maybe it’s because I had a hard time connecting with my first 2 therapist and our sessions often made me forget about my initial worry and make me fret over something they said instead. For example, I was very distraught when I sought therapy. My last resort because I knew I was dying. I could feel myself become more and more suicidal. I felt directionless yet I knew I needed to do something. I told them that I didn’t know what to talk about. Just started talking about how I felt in that moment. Overall not well. But strangely enough a lot of the session was silent, awkward, and eventually I asked should I talk about my past? I found myself facilitating more often when I was truly uncomfortable and one part of me didn’t want help. Just wanted more suffering. Because I’m not well equipped and sometimes making everyday suffering under the guise of self harm makes it almost appear like I’m in any sort of control. 

No recent event triggered my symptoms to worsen but rather the accumulation of the pressure to continue living life in addition to poor upbringing. It is a complicated story and dynamic as many relate to but I am currently spending 2 weeks with family. Small being 2 other people but demanding, toxic, painful people to be around and I’m only speaking for myself. I am not perfect. In my older age but being the youngest of the bunch I have been having a harder time disguising my displeasure, anxiety, and anger from them. Like it would be easier if I continued to cause no problem and enable their behavior and move on. I relocated away as soon as I could to put physical distance between us. If I can survive seeing them twice a year for holidays and seemingly for summers I can deal. But this has been one of the longest trips. One of the most irking. And I think I was in one poorest mental states compared to other times in my life. I think I will be dead before the end of the trip. Toxic family but too difficult to cut off. Not 100% bad people but I have tried speaking to them. Being honest. And being wildly misunderstood and punished. I much rather enable.  For my sake too unfortunately. I could see my many would see me to be in the wrong. I understand. Probably am. 
I’m ruining my relationship with my bf. Together 6 years. My mental is telling me he doesn’t care. I’ve seen neglect and mistreatment. He probably would better off without me. I love him so much but we have hurt each other too much. 
I am nothing. But what will it take to finally kill myself. I pray everyday I get the courage and get clouded with emotions. I want to die."
depression,The worst part of being depressed is just how alone you feel [lengthy rant incoming],"There is not a single person I think has ever truly understood the full extent of my depression. I've spent my whole life experiencing disappointment after disappointment, traumatic incident after traumatic incident, to the point where I wish I could ""win"" just once. Why can't a single positive experience ever happen to me? Seriously, it's as if I am being perpetually tormented by some sadistic deity. Any time something positive *does* happen, it gets tainted somehow. Here are some examples: A few months ago, I decided to leave the house for the first time in *years* and attend a concert... What happened? I not only end up throwing up right after the concert is over, (and publically humiliating myself in the process) but I also contract an awful case of Covid in the process. Boom! Experience tainted! A few years ago, there was a girl who I thought was into me, but she ended up being an emotionally abusive narcissist who lied to me constantly, talked behind my back, and used me as an emotional punching bag. Boom Experience tainted! THEN, not too long ago, I felt motivated enough to start brushing my teeth again. Except, that same day, I received news that that my mom had a heart attack. This killed any motivation I once had and I still haven't brushed my teeth ever since. Boom! Experience tainted! 

The thing is though, I have no-one to vent to about my frustrations. Everyone I've talked to has either called me ""lazy"" or ""dramatic"" or ""defeatist"" to some extent. I remember I was talking to a very close friend of mine one day and mentioned that I experienced a small emotional breakdown, (He said I can talk to him if anything was troubling me) and he immediately shut me down and tried to change the subject. Not even in a subtle way, just ""I don't want to hear any more of this."" It's not just my friends either, my family is the same way. I told my mom a few days ago about my rotten luck, which she then told my sister. Do you know what my sister said in response? She laughed and called me a ""weirdo"" She didn't even have the audacity to say it to my face, I had to eavesdrop. This is the same person who claimed she also experienced depression at one point. 

Why is it that wherever I go, I'm constantly met with platitudes? It's always my fault somehow. It's my fault that I'm depressed, it's my fault that I'm lonely, it's my fault that I can't cope with stress, my fault that I lack the motivation to do anything but sit around all day, it's always my goddamn fault no matter what. Do you know how much effort I put into simply existing? Why is that so difficult for people to understand? I just feel so alone and isolated, except I'm not allowed to express any of that without everyone making me feel like a piece of garbage. ""Other people have it worse! What do you have to complain about?"" 

I wish I could just... Well, you know."

depression,Wish that I manned up at an earlier age,"
I’m a 20M. My father was an alcoholic and my mother raised me on her own. He was a very weak man and it hurt to see him that way. Instead of using anger I became a doormat. My father was extremely athletic in his youth but did not pursue his talents after high-school. I believe this was part of what ate him alive and why he drank himself to death. I am also athletic and have baseball talent. But I got badly bullied at a late age and made a fuck ton of mistakes based on low self esteem. 

I dropped out of college and I’m finding that I genuinely have baseball talent. I can hit the shit out of the ball and I love the sport. I have these thoughts of me being on some baseball team and people from the past coming to harass me. I used to seriously be a push over and let people take advantage of me. I’ve always been handsome but I un-ironically didn’t see it. I took my father being absent very hard for some reason and completely rolled over. I was literally wearing makeup which is so out of character for me. So many people have a bad memory of me in that I was the receiver of abuse. 

I could have avoided being picked on had I just manned up and helped my mom. But I wanted the “perfect” life and ignored my reality. How to recover?"
depression,Life problems,I hurt and I been hurting for sometime. I been very secure about it. I know the reason I hurt is very cliche for any men. I been struggling to keep moving forward because the pain feels like it will last a lifetime and that I blame myself because I wasn’t strong enough to stop the hurt on time. I want to scream my lungs out sometimes but I just scream in silence but I feel my hurt roar. I am not suicidal. I am confuse on myself. I changed a lot and I did it for the wrong reason although at the time it felt like it was what I needed to become to see myself at my peak. But everything begin to crumble. I saw all of it and the most painful thing was that it was like it was slow moving on purpose so I wouldn’t miss anything and feel every bit of it. I talk to my dog and it helps but I am just talking to myself. I’m trying to be great I know what I want to become and what I want to mean. I want to be happy the right person but it’s hard to find someone that’s right. I’m not picky but it feels like I want someone to just be understanding and not push for so much change and when I ask for change as well to see actual proof. I am very tired of thinking of myself seeing something in the past. Like it calls to me and it manipulates me but I know it’s just me and it’s always been me. I’m stuck in a loop feeling countless things all at once and it’s because I put myself below to let someone heal before me. I can’t even begin to describe myself. I cried tonight for sometime I been holding that and it feels refreshing to have a dog to hear me out and be able to write this without denying that I feel like this. It’s okay I just want to grow and it’s been so long since I been alone. It’s something I need. I was told I could be too tough but that toughness was meant for me only it pushes me when I’m in situations like this and that’s why I write this big long paragraph that has very bad punctuation and grammar mistakes but this is me before I climb the big mountain. (Aka not a real mountain)

depression,I just can't talk,"These days I'm finding it so hard to talk to anyone. I'm supposed to be the one who is all loud and extroverted, who has tons of friends and is always going out with people. 

But it looks like my depression finally claimed my ability to speak. It's not that I don't want to talk, or that I have nothing to say, I desperately want to be able to say stuff, it's like a daily goal at this point. But the most I can get out is a few words before I just can't bring myself to talk for another few hours. 

I'm so worried it's going to affect my friendships, since all of them are used to me being really talkative. The weirdest thing is that nothing has really happened to make me worse or anything, just the usual depression I've had for years. I just can't talk anymore.

If anyone can relate or has any idea how to get over this I'm really desperate and would love to hear any advice."

The times that I do go out with friends though, I always feel like I create such an awkward environment because I’m either too quiet or too anxious to do or say something.

Everything aches, I have no desire or joy to do anything. Not even drink alcohol.

I've been to the doctor last week for blood tests. Waiting on them this week. I'm also having my second therapy appointment today.

I have agoraphobia which has pushed me to my room, no friends, only my father who doesn't understand anxiety or depression. I work from home.

depression,My life changed over night,"Hello i am 21 years old.
I am living in Germany and my life changed completely over night.
Two weeks before Christmas my best friend and I got together. I felt never such happiness before ( I finally got a relationship, after all the disappointments). I was completely in love and didn’t wanted to see anyone else except of her. Then on 23 to 24 December we slept over night at my place and we had sex. It was my first time. Everything was fine after that. But in the next morning I had to throw up. It was a little bit with blood and there wasn’t any food getting out. I didn’t even felt sick. I just had to throw up. I went to the hospital and this where it all started. I questioned everything and suddenly I wished that I never became that close to her and that I don’t love her. I panicked extremely because I had to hurt her. I just wished that we were best friends again. After two painful days I told her how I felt. She accepted it and we went back to friends. But I didn’t felt better after that. It took some day till I could think rationally again. The last 6 months were a completely up and down. Some weeks I am doing good and some weeks I get in a deep hole where I can’t think straight. She is doing good and also thinks about new men, while I still can’t accept that we aren’t mentioned to be together. It literally kills me inside to think about she getting someone new. What happened to me and why am I feeling like not being myself anymore. My theory is that I became depressed over night and that this is the reason why I lost or can’t feel my feelings for her anymore. To think about hurting her is the worst feeling I ever had. I just wish that we could be together till the rest of our life’s.

I hope someone can understand me."

Got to hang out with my local  Outlaws chapter (which I still have mad respect for , SYLO &amp; OFFO!!) Learned to ride motorcycles (because I was tired of riding in the back only lol) , did everything I have ever dreamed to ever do, and maybe more. 

Perhaps this is my time to leave this world. I refuse to stick around to be at the pity and mercy of a fucked up society, which will will fuck everyone up if you don't stand up to it.

depression,what happened to me?,"(I copied this from another post I made in another subreddit, I have been depressed before, this did not feel like depression at all. It felt a lot worse to me personally, but I think there will be people here that could maybe relate? If this does not fit the sub, I would be glad if anyone could tell me where I could post. I want to get this out!)


First of this is tough for me to write, because it was a situation happening to me in Fall of last year (maybe starting end of August or beginng of September, I do not remember)! There were so many things to all of this, I will try to focus on the majore ones and keep it basic. 

I really hope somebody can give me tips evaluating this whole situation and maybe someone can relate. Thanks to a of you!


So as I got really bad in the second half of last year, but my feelings date back a couple more months. I was in a relationship with my first girlfriend. It was rocky. It was probably really toxic and very likely mainly my fault. A good friend of mine is in a relationship with my exes best friend. 

I did not feel to loved in the relationship and also knew I had to work on my sudden bursts of rage/anger. I went to a Therapist for this problem. It felt like a fight just ""beeing enough"" for my former ex. (Reflecting I think it's stupid, she loved me, it was my problem)

It came to a point where I felt really uncomfortable. Hating my physical appearance, how unsuccessful I am at university, and not having to interesting hobbies. Those things tore me apart and made me put alot of pressure on myself. I started to feel less and less like myself.  I told my then gf, that I can't handle the relationship any longer nger if we do BOTH try to fix it and also told her how bad my mental state became. 

In that phase I already started trying to tell my friends that ""something is off"". I was just working on autopilot. Everything I was doing felt like I was doing for my girlfriend, when I had time for me alone I was just spending it for myself, feeling terrible. 

After just a little fight we broke up a couple of weeks later. I met another girl just 4 days later, had a good time with her. But all the pressure was still there and my ex wanted me (surprisingly) back. 

I felt really guilty back then but felt like I was doing the right thing (leaving atoxic relationship for a new girl, could have pulled it of better definitely!), but it felt like a lot of people were putting blame on me, so I cut ties to them. 

One night I met with my ex and somehow ended up in bed with her. To this day I don't know how this happened and why I did it. We have not had sex for 2years at that point. I felt terrible it felt terrible, but I somehow could not leave the situation. 

I told the girl I was seeing at the time 2 days later....that was fucking shitty of me! I should have told her immediately. She did not want to see me again and stopped any contact with me. 


And this is the crucial point. After having sex with my ex girlfriend I felt so terrible, confused, guilty, angry, I don't know I did not sleep, eat or do anything. I started to fear basically everyone. Got paranoid, dogs were scarry as hell. I imagined hearing staps behind my back, etc. 

I still wonder what this was and what happened there. It felt like a climax to a situation I was stuck in for months. It felt like I could have predicted it coming. Even before it happening it felt like my actions and my persona were not matching anymore (and I could not change it somehow?). It felt terrible. I have to this day not really spoken with anyone about the events happening last year and I feel like I will just look like the ass even thought I tried to apologize to everyone. My Ex, the girl I was seeing, my best friend.


I would love to hear from anyone that has been in a similar situation!"

But I just... can't.

I'm in a place in my life where I don't even know why I'm here anymore. I don't want to die but I am questioning why anymore. I'm just drowning again and again and even sleep which normally givese some semblance of rest is either very short or me having nightmares. I feel like a parasite in that for the longest time the only ones I can vent to is a few of my friends, but even they have their own issues and I just keep piling on top of them. I'm a disgusting person and I don't even know if I can change that.

I'm just here I guess, I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I am barely functioning and I've almost given up hope to ever get the help people keep saying I need. I need it, I desperately do, yet a combination of my own fears in opening up to a therapist and my lack of any money is just gonna kill me, I guess.

No Matter how much I improve tho I keep on coming back to this exact moment of pain. It's a cycle of insanity. The pain gives me an self improvement push, because I do everything in my power to escape it, I feel better for a while and then it slowly creeps in.

It gets worse and worse everytime tho, my perception of it starts to change. It's like a overload in my stomach, it hurts so deep, but a side of me enjoys it. It's almost paradoxically euphoric. Like so much pain it creates an euphoric feeling, weird af.

I have the urge to do something, just something to escape it, something to escape my life. I can't take this routine anymore, I can't take these people here anymore even tho I love them. I just wanna run away, I just wanna go train hopping or some crazy shit, travel around the world.

I wanna go all in, do some fucked up shit like rob a bank (ofc without hurting anyone), win win situation, either I have money to run away with or I kill myself. It's just an urge tho, drugs helped numb down that urge to do something crazy, but now idk what does. I feel like a neutron star is inside of my stomach.

I just want to be loved, I just want to have someone in my life I can trust, I just want to have family, I just want to experience true love once in my life, not this fake stimulation shit all around me. I want the memories to stop, I want to go out of this fucked up home, I want to stop being poor.

depression,Life as a caregiver,"Just wanted to see if there are any other caregivers out there struggling, whether it's for your parents or kids. 

I took care of a parent but I am now the mother of two severely autistic children. The younger is aggressive. 

I am just sitting on the couch crying because I took something he wasn't supposed to have, he chomped my arm..now there's a massive bruise and bite marks. We've been up since 3:30. It's like this a lot. Up at odd hours. I go to bed anxious because I never know how much sleep I'll get. 

The all day long screaming..the endless tantrums. He is 5 years old. I've been a parent for 8 years. I am just so tired of this life and wish I could escape. 

My husband and I live separate lives. We are isolated. For the first time in years, we had someone offer to help this weekend.. just 2 hours away and I felt human again. But, that'll be it. We are back to hell with school being the only reprieve from this waking nightmare this fall. If we want to spend any time together he has to miss work.

His family doesn't help or have anything to do with us because they're pieces of shit. His parents only have time for their daughter and their ""normal"" grandkids. 

I am trying to get Medicaid in my state through the children's waiver but so far it's been hours of Zoom calls and paperwork and there's only a few hundred slots for the state for behavioral and medical, it is always waitlisted. 

I don't want to die but I definitely don't want to live. Not like this. If I can't get this waiver, this is just my life unless the younger magically improves. I'm sick of my house. No friends. Hopeless future. Dead marriage. 

Everybody screams ""respite!"" I am trying to get it. For the love of God, people need to understand it is not just given out..not even if your child has severe behaviors. You are basically just left to deal with it and hope for the best.

depression,I fear that i will never be in a loving relationship.,"This is a bit of a rant because i didn’t really know exactly what to say so it’s a bit long.
TLDR: I do not think that i will be able to be  in a loving relationship with anyone and it’s making me a bit sad.

I’m in high school and yes i know it’s very early and i still have my entire life but based on how things have been my entire life so far, and with no sight of change in the future, i don’t think I’ll ever be able to be in a serious relationship, or even in a casual one (dating). It’s not because i am a rude person, i just have terrible social skills, and i am not very good looking. I was popular at my old school but i switched schools and now i am less popular. But even at my old school the thought of anyone girl liking me didn’t or seem possible, and it still doesn’t. My plan for daring was to start in college because i think my chances would be better, but it’s not like i don’t want to date now. I just don’t think that i can. I just do not think it’s likely that anyone would seek me out over anyone else to date. I oftentimes find myself lying in bed at night just imaging hanging out with a girlfriend, nothing sexual or inappropriate, just hanging out. Even in movies when i see people hug or kiss i feel something. It’s hard to describe the feeling but it’s sort of emptiness because it’s like looking at something that you really want, but will never have. I know i am probably just being dramatic and it will turn out ok for me but i have never really liked anyone that way and even if i did the chances that would someone would like me back, or even going out with me if i asked them are slim to none in my mind. My family life is very good, i have Avery good relationship with my parents and my friends. Not to toot my own horn but i am sort of the “funny” friend in my friend group but i still prefer to be alone and am an introvert. I am also very good at sports. I just don’t know how i would even talk to someone i liked. Whoever someone new comes into a group, or anyone me know any situation, i have no idea how to talk to them. In my own friend group i am very outgoing, and i kind of talk a lot. But if it’s anyone not in my friend group i shut down and try to escape the situation. Because of this, I just don’t see a loving relationship anywhere near in the future, and i am sad about it. I know that i need to be more outgoing but i am definitely getting better. Again, i am definitely being over dramatic about this but it’s a though i have had for a long time and i just need advice. Although i have very good relationships with my family and friends, i am a very private person and i really hate talking about this type of stuff around anyone so if i have a problem i just keep it to myself and i can do that but i just need to talk about this problem. Anything helps."

depression,"I dont feel so great, havent been feeling great for a while now..","Just for context, I struggle with basic necessities. I used to live a good life, it wasn't the best but I wasn't wanting for nutritious food, air conditioning and things like electricity or water or gas to cook. Now I have moved, it is terrible. I have been trying to get used to things, it has been over an year.

I don't get along with a lot of people here because the culture is entirely different. I stick out like a sore thumb. I don't have exactly the best relationship with my parents. I lack the freedom to even go out for an evening walk or wear clothes I like.

Yesterday I was terribly sick because there was a heat wave..and as usual there is nothing to help. Frequent power outages. Coupled with lack of water. I work full time and another job on the weekends. 

I got into a good university program but since my paperwork is at a standstill although I am trying hard to make things work . I am worried about my dwindling finances.

 I have a bf who I love to bits but he is more or less absent in my life as he is struggling with his own issues which are far more dire than mine . He has chronic depression and is struggling with suicidal thoughts. I am extremely worried about him. It is like everything is crashing down on me..and I am helpless. I sometimes get these dark thoughts. 

That if I weren't alive I wouldn't have to go through so much anguish and pain. Hell I have even googled cyanide poisoning once..I never told him...because I don't want to add to his burden. I keep bothering him to spend together..it sounds so selfish..and I hate myself for being needy. 

I visited a psychiatrist she prescribed me a few meds, at first it felt it was working. I was a bit better but now its like it isn't effective anymore. I am almost out of meds but have no time to get it refilled because of my work. 

People say I should be grateful that I have a job and a roof over my head. Maybe I am ungrateful. I have gotten bad to the extent that I am neglecting my pet cat... I am a horrible person. Yesterday I couldn't stop thinking how am I unworthy of love and trying to figure out how to navigate through this horrible existence.

I am so tired of everything..I wish I didn't exist. Now I just want to isolate myself and disappear."

    Not sure if it's entirely related to being a demisexual but I have this mentality where I'm impulsive and it leads  me drifting away from being a demi sexual but in the end of the day I don't hook up with anyone and I still want to meet someone truly special or worth memories. I truly started to hate the world around me and myself . These past few weeks I started this new job and it made me feel more lonely than before to a degree. I've been working with only one co-worker who barely talks to me and from time to time I close for some nights alone .


   When people barely acknowledge you as a human being you either grow numb to that emotion or you just feel empty or just bad. I'm too comfortable with being miserable and I don't complain much because it's just an everyday thing with me now. For the people who are looking for someone what are you doing in the meantime to just fill that void and help you become a better person because I truly want to be one.

depression,I'm scared about my future,"I never really talk about this to someone else, i was afraid of people think im just looking for attention.

I'm 27 , i have no friends, i still live with my parents and i live in 3rd world country. i've been feeling depressed for as long as i remember , but i dont really feel depress like all time , i still enjoy playing games, watching tv, hangout with my family but if i have somekind of problem in life i instantly feel so depress like i wanted to end it all , this also happen very often when i try to sleep or even watching movies with sad scene.

I was a very problematic teen, my family is not rich we were struggling but my parents still try to give me the education i need.. but i wasted all of it, i flunked my collage twice, i get a tattoo as soon as graduate from highschool ( its a big deal where i come from, since its hard to get a job if you have a tattoo ) but even after all of that they still love me.. 

I work as a courier since i dont really have any degree or talent, i give almost all of my salary to my family, to pay for house utilities since both my parents already retired. ive 2 siblings brother and sister they also give part of their salary to our family, both my siblings graduate from collage also have a really good job, im like the black sheep in the family... i dont really have much money to myself, but im actually kinda happy i can at least contribute to my family even though the amount is small compare to my siblings its makes me feel useful. 

Every night i keep thinking about how bad my future will be , since i dont have any saving, no degree nor talent to have at least a decent future. im socially awkward person, making friends its hard for me, im not always like this, i was really confident in the past but at some point i just hate and afraid of meeting new people. 

my depression got so bad i try to kill myself a few years ago, by hanging, but i failed not because the rope snapped or some miracle or anything.. i just stop midways because i was so afraid of doing it, it feels so empty its scary..i'm too afraid to live my life but i'm too much of a coward to end it all, i hate myself..  i'm sorry for all the people who read all this whining till the end , i just want to get it out, all of it ..thankyou."

Not a few days later, he had gone to visit his ex. He added more girls on Insta. His snapchat score has gone up from 12, 243 to 12, 245. And when I broke up with him he proceeded to tell me the truth - about him checking some girls' OF accounts because he'd be curious towards the end of our relationship, and confessing that he didn't want to upset me when he'd received a snapchat message from some random girl, swearing up and down the weekend before I'd break up with him on Tuesday night 6/21, that he wasnt talking to other girls, asking me ""where'd you get that idea from?"". 

He's gone and deleted all pictures of me from his insta (mostly because he saw that I had done that first).
I don't even remember if he'd apologized to me for lying to me, for having been unfaithful. I feel betrayed. I had a stirring suspicion that he could be cruel, that he was capable of being a cheater - but this version of him...He's a monster to me now &amp; here I am, grieving the loss of a best friend and the man I idealized. A man who'd always been there for me, especially during my hardest times because my family is unsupportive, I also no longer have any friends that I connect with and both of my parents are mentally ill (I'm currently dealing with the loss of the only stable person in my life and now I'm left with dealing with my mother's psychotic episodes..) - I'm left alone with no support system in the midst of battling my own depression to stay sane and not lose my job and my life (its been incredibly stressful and I'm scared I'm going to consider 'the end'.) 

All I'm looking for is some friendship and guidance through this difficult time.

depression,Having the hardest time,"I'm really struggling. I'm dealing with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and probably some remaining symptoms of my bygone BPD diagnosis. I struggle so much with executive dysfunction, especially when it comes to school. And I only took ONE CLASS this semester to make things easier on myself, but I still managed to fail it. I just couldn't bring myself to do the work these last few months. I'm so anxious and upset with myself.


I'm supposed to be getting married this year, but my fiance is at or near his wit's end with me. He needs me to manage myself better, and I'm trying, but I feel like I can't do anything. We live in the middle of nowhere and I can't drive, so I can't get a job here to help pull my weight. He doesn't know I failed my class and I'm scared to tell him because, as he's always reminding me, it's my only real responsibility. I'm so ashamed of myself and scared that I won't be able to get better so I'll lose him.


I recently self-harmed for the first time in years. I've also been having suicidal thoughts. I used to see a DBT therapist, but they're not covered under Medicaid, so I don't have anyone to talk to about the things going on with me. All I ever want to do is sleep. I weaned myself off the highest dose of Vyvanse back in January, and it's made things so hard. I've gained a bunch of weight (a massive trigger for me), I can't focus on anything, and I'm constantly tired (sometimes I sleep for 12+ hours at a time, only to feel groggy the rest of the day). I'm depressed. I know I need to see a GP, a psychiatrist, and a therapist, but I've just turned 26 and I no longer have insurance through my parents. I enrolled for Medicaid, but I don't understand the system and haven't been able to bring myself to find doctors through the Medicaid portal. It also doesn't help that I'm moving out of state next month and will likely have to sign up all over again.

I ran away from home at 17 after being in an abusive household and being R'd many times as a younger teen. It was extremely hard to deal with, especially with being on my own and learning about a world I wasn't allowed to learn about as a kid.
It took years to get over and many break throughs that what happened to me was not okay. I couldn't get out of bed back then. I had no want to do anything except bawl my eyes out. I even stopped drawing for an entire year (life long artist) and had to relearn everything when I went back to it.

I thought it was over. I felt so much better. I cut my dad permanently out of my life, and my mother and I have grown a great relationship after she accepted her faults with what happened during my teen years. She so wonderful now and truly tries. My fiance is the most supportive man in the world and does so much for me, and I him.

My problem - I started not sleeping again. At first it was just staying up a little later than normal, but now I'm up till the early hours in the morning and just take short naps during the day. It makes me feel so gross and sick. I feel all over again that there is something wrong with me. Im so stressed with everything.

I'm going to the doctor soon to talk about it, but I'm scared to be told I need to be evaluated again. I do not want to go through any of that process again, I dont want to deal with tears and hidden emotions. I just want to work and be happy with myself. I dont have the time to be worrying about my body or sleep.

depression,I haven’t felt happy in a long time. Please help.,"I’m 19 years old. I’m laying down in bed and I’ve been crying for an hour. My thoughts have been spiraling and it’s making me really upset. Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about my lack of friends, my intense social anxiety, my body, everything. Most of my friendships fell apart last year because of my depression. I have to get a job but it just seems so overwhelming. 

I keep thinking about how if I were to disappear only my immediate family and one friend would realize I’m missing. I don’t plan on doing anything to myself because I don’t want the people I love to go through that pain, but it just sucks knowing I have so few people who care about me. I go to college but I don’t have any friends there, and last semester some people were really mean to me undeservingly. I try to be friendly, but nothing I do really leads to any sort of relationship. I get embarrassed about 80% of my social interactions, I’m super self-conscious, I just wish I wasn’t here.

I’ve felt so disconnected from reality for a long time, and I’ve felt super depressed this past week, and on and off since I was 13. I work out occasionally, I read, play video games, do art, take my dog for walks, I do so many things that are supposed to “help” me but nothing works. I’m so tired. I’m exhausted of living like this, I just want to feel normal again. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to get back to a more normal state of mind? Please don’t say go to therapy or go to the gym, I’m sick of those answers. If you have personal anecdotes, can relate, or have any advice please comment. I hope someone sees this because I feel like I’m losing my mind. I don’t know what to do anymore."

depression,How to stay productive?,"Tl;dr How can I stay productive after coming out of a depressive episode?

So I’ve been doing a really bad job managing my life these past months. My biggest problem had been cleaning my room. I had not cleaned in a month, and I had piles of dirty laundry, trash laying around bc I was too lazy to put a trash bag in my trash can, a bunch of papers for school and work. Today I suddenly found the inspiration to clean it and it felt so good to do it. I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

The thing is I know I won’t always feel inspired like today. And this isn’t the first time I’ve had really bad episodes, but I’m scared of completely losing inspiration one day. I want to be able to stay consistent with things I have to do, and want to do. 

I’ve also grown more anxious about time. While I was cleaning I found my old writing and drawing journals that I loved working on. I also found a candle that a friend gifted me for Christmas, and it was a candle for Taurus season (4/20 to 5/20). I remember telling myself that I would light it when the season starts. When I found the candle today, I realized how the season had already ended, and I just felt a wave of sadness upon knowing how much time has passed and feeling like I’m wasting it.

I have a lot of goals and dreams, yet I can’t seem to work for them. I just waste so much time everyday feeling miserable. Are depressive episodes inevitable? Will I always have them? If yes, how can I better manage them? They’re just ruining my life but I can’t control it and it just feeds into my hopelessness.

I wanted to vent a bit, so you guys can ignored the ranting bit. But I do wanna know if anyone knows any tips on how to stay productive? What has worked for you?"

depression,I don't know if this is depression or not,"Generally, I wouldn't think of myself as depressed since I don't have most, if any, of the symptoms. However, when i went to a therapist a few years ago she said that I have it and that some of my words are a unconscious cry for help. I suffered (still suffer from, but not as severe as back then) from OCD and my life at the time was not that great. I didn't realize how miserable I was until it all crashed down in 2021 when I was at my worst. 


Anyway, shortly after it crashed down and I was recovering from that, I discovered that (at least the time) I was very excited at being at risk of physical harm. I was terrified of sitting on a motor cycle but after experiencing it (I was on the back seat) I loved it so much, I wanted to drive one on a highway. I got stung by a jellyfish and it was agonizing but after a while I had the wish to swim with one of those gigantic jellyfish.


Last but not least, the cigarette. I was smoking a cigarette but it quickly went out because of the temperature and wind conditions. Since I wasn't sure whether it was still burning deep withing or not, I pressed the cigarette butt with my thumb. I felt nothing on my thumb. So I pressed it again and then again and again."

There’s no point for me to go on anymore imo."
depression,I just wanted to bring up something I was just reminded of right now. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. Like is too short to take everything so serious.,"I made a post a couple weeks ago or so. Being very frank and honest about my depression journey and what I’ve been doing the last few years (not much was the answer to what I’ve been doing…not much). And then very shortly after that I break up with this guy I dated for such a short period of time who really made me feel something. Made me feel alive for the first time in a long time. Made me so happy. But it ended kind of bad…I don’t think he was mature enough for a relationship yet. And I’ve been feeling sorry for myself for weeks now because I’m so hurt because this didn’t work out…and I’m watching this comedy special and it’s bringing up and honoring comedians like robin williams and Richard Pryor and…I personally love stand up comedy. I love to watch entertainment that makes me laugh. And in one of the few monologues that were given they were talking, many times, about the healing power of laughter. 

You have to be able to laugh at what goes on in the world. Even the dark stuff. Life is too short to take everything so seriously. To hang onto every negative feeling and get lost in that, and wallow, and get stuck there.

It’s hard to realize when you’re in it…Ik it’s so hard. But I used to live my life more like a comedian…to try to find the humor in the things that happen in my life. I want to try to do more of that again. Like with this relationship that has made me so sad…I can’t help but laugh at myself a little. I really put my whole heart into someone I only knew for about a month. I’m a fucking idiot lmao. I really am. But you know…I’m tired of the crying. I’m tired of sadness. In all aspects of life including this particular situation. All I can really try to do is try to grow. That’s all we can all do. This was very much a bit of a rant. It’s not very well thought out, but I hope some of you guys can relate in some way to what I’m trying to describe. Or feel inspired to take life a little less seriously also."

depression,Thinking about being done (M25),"I’m in crisis mode at the moment. I was already there but then my girlfriend who was my rock broke up with me extremely suddenly and now my feeling of safety is gone. Im scared of my thoughts, if I had means to I would’ve killed myself tonight. The loneliness is unbearable and living feels genuinely hopeless. Children are being killed in schools and our government does nothing, we are approaching summer and the forests will burn again and again, we will do nothing. 

I’m doing everything I’ve done in the past to fix this, I’ve been going back to the gym making myself dinners staying productive but I’m getting no enjoyment from anything. Not to mention my appetite has completely disappeared I find myself heaving if I try to force myself to eat. In the past whenever I’ve been like this I’ve just called someone to have sex to burry my emotions deeper but I can’t this time something feels different. This feels like a hole I may not be coming out of. I’m just looking to talk to an empty void here since it takes a month and a half to talk to a therapist. I have never wished I was dead as much as I do now."

depression,What is the literal point in living?,"Seriously, you wake up, you force yourself to do whatever hygienic rituals you need to do before actually getting on with your day, maybe that burns thirty minutes to an hour tops-and for pretty much everyone over the age of 10 that usually becomes a rushed ritual where you feel you never actually have enough time and are trying to make whatever bullshit you have laid out in front of you…

So on to that bullshit in front of you, you go to school or work, something forced upon your will that you can’t decline doing, as it’s something that simply “needs to be done” in pretty much every form of society known to modern man on this planet. You get through whatever horse shit you need to, and then what? 

You perhaps engage in trivial relationships that don’t last or give you the false hope of something meaningful in your life. Maybe you have sex which is a fleeting pleasure before it’s over and you are thrust back into the usual rhythm of your life. 

Maybe you have some hobbies you take part in that don’t actually mean anything beyond the false belief that they hold some form of value rather than picking things to waste away time that you wouldn’t be spending doing nothing just ticking down the seconds your life is wasting away. Maybe you take part in said hobbies to attract partners to have said relationships and sex with in some diminutive, round-about effort to tie together any meaning at all to the worthless, time wasting shit you might take part in that you believe acts as an identity to your existence. The people you wish to attract have even less substance, believing just because you’re a shmuck doing some bullshit all of a sudden they take an interest in you and decide to give you a shot at engaging in a more-than-average interaction. 

Just what the fuck is even the point? It’s all so fucking stupid, shallow, and meaningless. If life isn’t meant to be analyzed so deeply and just “enjoying the ride”, what is there to even enjoy? Getting lost in the transparency of it all? Turning a blind eye to the nothingness of the average day? Filling your schedule with aloof activities that are brainless and not meaningful in any way shape or form, just for the sake of filling time before old age and death?

Fuck, it just makes no sense to me how any of that can make people happy. It just comes off as people tricking themselves that what they’re doing is meaningful in any way. 

And then when people such as myself voice this, they say I’m just a doubter, I’m just negative, or I’ve got issues, I should see a therapist, if only I could ‘see the forest for the trees’, or people feel bad for me that I’m ‘missing out’ on life having such pessimistic views.

I just fucking hate life. I want to tell everyone about it too. I wish for those who claim to have found happiness to tell me why they think their life is actually worth living."

That makes me feel like shit because I can’t help that I have mental health issues and their basically punishing me for that. Like wtf! I thought they were my bff but I honestly don’t know anymore.

I get through the day but at the end of the night i feel how alone i am. The feeling is hard to explain i feel isolated from the world. trapped in my own head my own thoughts and emotions. it’s like i can’t escape them. i feel bad for the way i push everyone away. but being by myself just helps me not take what i’m actually feeling out on everyone. Yet, all i want is my own person that’ll remind me i am loved , heard someone that can make me feel like life is worth living again.

depression,Scared and confused,"Hey, I am so confused, I constantly get intrusive suicidal thoughts. However, unlike the past, I have not planned it out this time. I do imagine it sometimes though, and through that I can see the consequences I would face if I go through. Like, the pain of my parents, the way I have to face God (suicide is forbidden in my religion). I feel confused because I don't know how to deal with my emotions. I currently have no outlet to express them as my friends are equally stressed with exam season. I would say, I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill as I've always tend to exaggerate my problems. I find it worrying that I constantly seek death and self destructive ways during this period. I've been trying my best to calm my thoughts to the point I can't start studying for my next exam. I've broke down multiple times this exam week and held myself back from cutting. I am just an ordinary person, with a good life.....so why must I feel this way....my friend told me it might be because I'm constantly exposed to the trauma of others. People used to vent to me about their suicidal, depression problems very descriptively and I never stopped them, afraid that they wouldn't be able to express it and it would get worse for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling this horrible feeling of sadness deep within me, every time I'm no longer in contact with a person. When I'm with someone, I can rely on their energy to be happy and keep the mood. I hope I'm happy during those times....if i wasn't....that would be sadder. These thoughts and feelings started before my exams were close. I know it's mostly because of my overthinking, but I don't know how to stop it. I only escape to social media, stories, movies, etc. At this point, I'm just trying every healthy way possible to escape it and be a normal person so I don't burden anyone."
depression,i don’t want to be here :),"My life has been slowly going downhill, like a train heading towards a cliff on fixed tracks just waiting to crash and burn. A few years ago, right before COVID-19 hit I felt lost in my life. Even though i was pursuing what i thought id wanted to do my whole life, i didn’t feel like me. once covid started to spread and the school i was attending shut down i tried to focus more on finding myself but ended up more lost and depressed than before. i made some insane decisions, and while i regret none of it, i wished that i had actually learned from them. i have been in the same pattern for the last 3years at least. and nothing but negativity has come from it. no matter how many times i try to break free i feel powerless as i watch myself subconsciously fall into the same patterns over and over again. i got married in january 2022 and spent the first few months of my marriage homeless with my husband. we are finally in a place but our marriage is struggling. i don’t feel happy and i don’t know if i’m not happy with him or if i’m unhappy all around. i don’t feel like he cares about me. i worked so hard to get us into the place we are in now but now that we are here i’m doubting if i made the right choice. i don’t feel like he understands just how hard this is for me. we just moved from the only place i’ve ever lived to a city 3.5+hrs away from any of my family. i have no friends, im struggling to find a new job, money is tight, and i don’t have any will to live. he doesn’t seem to think about me anymore and seems uninterested in the words that i have to say. i just want things to get better."
depression,Why don't I care about people?,"I'll start off with saying that I do care immensely about animals, always have, so I don't think it's entirely a lack of empathy. Also when I was younger I do remember caring more about others, my grandma's death being the last time I really remember caring about anyone (10 years ago). But now, I just don't. For instance my mom has cancer and I haven't had a single emotion about it. She also injured her shoulder and I have to help her do things, and all I can think about is how I would rather be doing anything else and how she's just whining for attention. Sounds mean, but it's just my thought process. I honestly don't think there's even one human on earth that I would be sad about them dying. But my dog, yeah I'd never get over it as I haven't with every dog I've ever had that died.

I'm really only happy when I'm alone. My ""boyfriend"" I haven't talked to in over a week. I just don't care. All I want is to live in the middle of nowhere and have a bunch of animals and not talk to people. Everything anyone does irritates me, I have no idea how to talk to people and if anyone talks about anything other than animals I just stop talking to them because I find other topics super boring, pointless and irrelevant.

I often wonder if I'm a sociopath, something Ive been called by others many times. But I think my love for animals rules that out. I'm really curious what my problem is and if I should do something about it or just continue working toward my goal of being a hermit on a farm lol"

depression,Just want to write down my feelings - boyfriend[25] has depression,"My partner has been struggling with depression and anxiety since he was a teenager. Dad was absent most of the time during childhood, past toxic relationships, being bullied at school...

Now things have been getting harder because of Covid and difficulties in his work.

He told me he's been thinking about killing himself but he said he couldn't do it and won't do it because that will hurt his parents. It's the only one thing he can't do this life.

Now he's working but feels like being treated like a dog by the employers. He says ""I feel like I’m in a fishbowl, looking out at the world where everything is beautiful outside, but I can’t escape...""

He says I don't understand how he feels and he feels betrayed because I'm just like everyone else... All I've been trying to do is just to be there for him. But I can only do so much to help. I can't 100% relate to his feelings because I guess I'm the few lucky ones who don't have those problems in life. All I can tell him is just that I'm here whenever he needs me. That's all. 

I've been encouraging him to go to therapy, I think he's still considering it, he's done it before but probably didn't feel it's helpful enough. Sometimes I don't know when's the best time to bring it up. When we're having a good time and great conversation? Or when he's feeling depressed? I don't know...I want to help him find a good therapist.

I'm taking care of my own feelings at the same time. I just wish I could help him feel a little better. I wish he sees the beauty I see in him."

depression,"Constant misery, constant chest pain","Hello everyone. To preface this: May 2022 has been the most emotionally difficult month of my life. At the end of April my gf broke up with me. Her last message was her listing off every time I was being “difficult” and “required her support”, even though I thought that we managed to get over all of these episodes. Then my grandmother died. She was at home with us (my family and I), I saw the life fade from her eyes. A few days ago, father was fired from work because he was no longer of use to the company. That same day I failed an exam at uni. Because of all this, I have developed this awful constant chest pain. It hurts so much, and I barely have any energy to even lift my arms. I am constantly on the verge of tears but I can’t even cry. Just trudging through the days now. It’s awful. 

Is this normal — well, I mean none of this is, but is it reasonable that I’m feeling this way? Does chest pain happen in moments like these?"

depression,My therapist said that my life circumstances aren’t enough to make me depressed,"I’ll preface this with: I love my therapist. She has been amazing so far, &amp; I especially love that she doesn’t push labels or meds on me. 

However, lately I have been feeling depressed. I have quite a lot going on that, individually, worsen my mood and outlook on life. My grandma moved into a home (I traveled to see her &amp; that’s when I noticed the depressive symptoms coming on), my busy internship &amp; class schedule ended (boredom is not good for me &amp; I feel lost without my internship), my potential roommates ghosted me after I turned down their offer to live with them, traumatic memories/feelings are being brought up in my new relationship, and my dad and I got into a fight and aren’t on speaking terms. 

To me, all of this sounds like more than enough to cause situation depression. But my therapist thinks it’s my birth control, not any of this. To me, it seems obvious these circumstances could make anyone depressed, especially someone who is very sensitive like myself. It annoys me that she said that. Who is she to say that it isn’t enough? It all depends on how these things affect me, how I cope with them, how I view them. My grandma moving into a home makes me feel like my childhood is being ripped away. Her sadness makes me feel hopeless. Couldn’t that alone make someone depressed? I even told her that I was feeling “off” when I was traveling, before I started the pill, yet she still said it’s most likely the birth control.🙁"
depression,When would be a good time to bring up therapy to partner who has depression?,"Hi, I've been wanting to encourage my boyfriend to go to therapy. I've mentioned it once a few weeks ago, he didn't say anything back then. He's probably considering it. 

I don't know if I should bring it up again, and if I do should I say it when he's stable and calm? Is it a bad idea to talk about therapy when he's feeling depressed? Will I make him feel like I want to push him to doctors so I don't have to deal with him? How should I phrase it so he knows I'm here for him if he needs?

Any advice?"

depression,Let's have a good conversation before I die.,[removed]
depression,Was doing well with depression but an opponent in an online game really messed me up,"I was playing a really popular online FPS (not giving it away because I want extra anonymity and it doesn't matter anyway) and I was playing pretty okay: not my best nor my worst. I got some kills in and two of them were of one player.
Later they finally got a kill on me when I approached two enemies alone. I was like ""whatever"" because I admittedly walked into that, it was 2v1, and I knew that I wasn't playing at my best that game. But then the one player proceeded to teabag me for a relative while (a solid 5 seconds). Not even their teammate joined in.
I've only been teabagged a handful of times over my collective 3 years of playing the game (mostly bc I play console) and it's only ever gotten me annoyed at most. But for some reason, this time was different.
It genuinely hurt me because I literally did not do *anything* to the player and it was so fast and aggressive, as if they really wanted to insult me. Plus, it was a sneaky kill and I didn't even see them, not necessarily something to gloat about.
After watching a replay of our match, it may have seemed like I was targeting them because only *I* ever killed then, but even then I only killed them twice (they hid from my team for most of the game). They did not do this to anyone else and if anything, they would always go to damage ME whenever they had a choice. I just felt so targeted.
I did get my revenge, but I had to go a little out of my way to do it. When I did kill them they typed (basically) ""what a good job helping your team"" Later, both our teams were attacking each other equally and they got a kill off me because of it and they teabagged me AGAIN even though I literally was not even paying attention to them nor attacking them.
Like, why so agro? They had a personal vendetta against me or something.
On the game's subreddit it seems to be split 60/40 between people who think teabagging is just a light-hearted joke/a strategy to deliberately tilt opponents or just straight-up BM respectively. So it feels like I'm being too sensitive about it and I should just shut up because ""it's just pixels and how can pixels be offensive?""
I know this is a very small incident, but it really did affect me a lot and I don't even know why. I've never been the target of a chat insult before, so I guess the criticism just freaked me out. It ruined the rest of my night. I honestly forgot my good games afterward until writing this now. I haven't gotten depressed for a little bit. Why did this have to bring it back?
Also, am I being too sensitive? How do I just let this kind of stuff go?"
depression,my mother has depression or dementia not sure,"In march i and my mom went to psychiatric hospital , she was having unexplained anxiety . doctors diagnosed her with anxiety with the next visits they changed it to major depressive disorder saying anxiety within her age (63) can be a symptom of depression . she is taking effexor xr 75mg and remeron 15mg since then and she started to improve a little but not too much.  
   
she recently shows some odd behaviors like forgetting events , misplacing things and she once placed her phone on cooker , repeating questions. i talked to her she denied such things. I don't know if these symptoms are part of her depression or maybe depression is related to underlying dementia i don't really know.  
I can't stop thinking about it and i haven't slept last night searching the entire web and got no answers. Thing is our next visit is in 2 weeks and we can't ask to make it earlier except if we pay expenses which we can't afford right now.

depression,I hate myself but strangely I have never been more confident in myself because I just don’t care anymore,I am a very self loathing person. I hate myself for a lot of reasons but it has gotten to the point where I just don’t care anymore. And this indifference to my own emotional anguish has somehow given me confidence I have never had. I am able to approach and talk to and flirt with women I am attracted to because I now have this feeling like I cannot be hurt or broken more than I already am. I know this is not a healthy way to think but at the same time I do not want to think differently because I have never had more confidence in myself. This has happened since my mom passed away from Covid in March. I no longer feel like I have anything to live for as my mother was the rock in my life and that feeling has actually been very liberating. It has been liberating in the sense that I no longer care about rejection because I have already rejected myself and my own life. I feel as though no one can hurt me because I am already a shattered and broken person and nothing matters anymore. I do not care what you think of me anymore because it doesn’t matter. I know I need help because I am very depressed but I have no health insurance and cannot afford a therapist. I now seek casual encounters with strange women because it’s really the only time I feel alive. I know I am sick but I do not know how to stop this downward spiral I am on.

depression,I wanna die and I honestly don't feel a thing.,"Idk. I'm not even sad, I just don't feel anything. I've had many chances to get help but I wanna stay this way. I don't have a reason, for why I don't wanna get better. Is there anyone who knows something to help? I just wanna not feel like I'm disintegrating"
depression,I keep having dreams,"Faces I miss seeing, the warm embrace, the way they made me feel. Things I seem to relive lucidly at night, so vivid I forget I'm asleep.

Sometimes, I meet new friends in my dreams, to replace the old ones. I hold them close and tightly, and begin to whisper my deepest feelings for them, and I cry in fear of disappointing them. I don't want to let go, because I don't want to lose them again.

Screaming, crying, and throwing a fit because I'm so desperate for love and care and attention. They won't respond, they'll leave me there in a fit of my own rage and despair. Staring at me with a strange lack of concern. Sometimes, it's almost as if to express a total lack of interest in me.. a disappointment.. it's Unattractive behavior.

I wake up, and they are gone. I wake up, Wishing I'd have been better, so they wouldn't have left me. I spend the rest of my day, thinking about why I'm such a disappointment to them all..

I'm angry, I'm sad, I'm anxious that I will never find my way out of the nightmare. I feel that I cannot express this to anyone and that I'm wasting my time when I do.. but no matter what, I'm shouting into the void.

The ache is unbearable. Who's place is it to call me selfish because I wish to end it? By the time it matters, it's too late. But I guess it's always been my fault. I guess I'm halfway there, what harm in digging my own grave?

And if I've already lost all my hope, and motivation. Who's gonna be able to make it all matter again before it's too late?"
depression,Too much,"I have heard over and over and over again from friends and people that I’m too much. My previous relationships ended because I am too much. When I got married 2 years ago I thought finally there was someone who would stick with me and he left. When my best friend was there for me during the separation I thought maybe it wasn’t going to be hopeless and someone else could be there for me.

That is, until they messaged me to say they’re too burnt out and need to step back from the friendship.

I truly wish I was less of a burden. 

I truly wish I was successful that night."

depression,My best friend completely abondoned me for her boyfriend,"Some context: I (22M) have been friends with a girl (23F) and a guy (28M) for about 5 years now. 4 years ago me and girl had a romantic relationship together. It didn't quite work out, but she insisted that we remained friends. I was hesitant at first, but over time it seemed to work out just fine, and I really valued the friendship we had developed. I recognize most people don't have this experience, and perhaps that's for a good reason, as you'll see later. 

My guy friend recently has become interested in dating said girl. He was very respectful about it - even asked me if I would be okay with it, because he didn't want to step on anyone's toes. I said yes because I know both of these people - they're both friends I've had for years, and I thought I could trust them.

Well. I trusted wrong. The guy friend told girl that if she wanted to date him, she'd have to massively cut back her relationship with me. And while he didn't come right out and say it, I can read between the lines: he doesn't want me to have a relationship with her at all. And I guess she agreed with him, because she cut off all communication with me entirely.

I was homescholled my whole life. I had no social outlets growing up. So when I left home for college, the friends I made were more or less the first friends I'd ever had. I don't have a wide net of friends either; I could probably count the number of friends that I actually talk to on one hand. And these people were definitely on that hand. So this happening is devastating for me.

Essentially it shows me that my friendship isn't valued in the slightest. That at the drop of a hat, these people are willing to completely write me out of their life. And that makes me really sad."

depression,2 and a half years since my post here,"Basically, I feel better. Those crying nights at some point began to fade away after 1 year and the most important thing ive learned is to control my inner depresive voice and tell myself ""dont worry its not even that deep keep going"" I mean you literally have to encourage yourself and dont let anything to stop that. Your mind is strong but you are stronger and if you commit to dont let intrusive thoughts come, you will get better 100%

This is just a message to the people who is having hard times, yk it gets better and if it doesnt, you get better and your perspective of your life slowly chances back to mentally healthy which causes to make your life better.

Please keep fighting, control your inner depresive voice and dont throw away your time left"
depression,Loyalty or pleasure?,"Lately, I've been struggling with my desires. My wife and I haven't made love in a VERY long time and, I don't know if it has to do with the physical problems she says she has or, her worry that her 95 year old Dad sleeps in the next room. The sex with her used to be amazing. It wasn't JUST sex though, it was love making at it's very best. I've gone without for awhile and even though, I constantly tell her, I miss the closeness, there still is very little reaction from her. Oh, the teasing happens here and there but, after that? Nothing. I masturbate to porn quite. It is an urge relief but, no substitute for the actual love making. I want it back. I'd give anything to have it back but, at this point it looks as if, I am doomed to jerk off forever. I've had strangers online tell me to go find a clean professional, to get pleasure that way but, my loyalty &amp; love for my sweetie prevents me from doing that. I get much loving affection from her but, not sexual. Herein lies the dilemma. I desperately desire the sexual affection. I want and need someone to touch, kiss and, lick me like that. But, I can't hurt her like that. So, the sexual affection is off the table. And, it depresses the shit out of me. Be well, peace out."

depression,How get thru this hell ?," Why are people trying to adapt to you? I feel such discrimination and such discomfort, such a feeling that I am seriously ill and unaware of it, such a feeling I am trapped between four walls and I do not know where to put myself, how do people think and live, but in a completely different way. You walk down the street or work, treating you like a gentleman or a child so you don’t hurt you. Wtf? Why so ?Such a feeling behind me is always that I am seriously ill and your days are numbered.And it makes me very nervous, it makes me feel like I’m someone’s bitch and people treat me like garbage. And junk is called those people who can't take care of themselves or be responsible for their own problems. Am I wrong ?And I’m really sure something is wrong with me, because if all was well, really life wouldn’t be on the couch every day and I wouldn’t be angry at my parents or anyone else, I just didn’t find myself guilty, but I’m sure someone isn’t right with me. 100%.How I see out there and how much you are writing to find a psychologist. I tried a lot together, I walked, I looked for help, but I always felt worse after them but it really didn't make me feel more disappointed, the feeling that the specialists don't delve into my problem that I would like to solve, just keeps me unreasonable, behind. Like many people around me. I don’t have any social life though I really would like to have it because my communication at the moment is really toxic, maybe because I feel like a garbage .Like other specialists in the field, I avoid me as a sucker because of this, I don't go to the doctor and I don't have social insurance because I don't trust people, it was convinced a lot times.The feeling that someone really has something like that is that people just avoid me, and even if they don't, it just applies to you. Even my parents do it so much that they know something about me, but they just don't want to say it because I'm sensitive to the truth. And that mostly drives me crazy."
depression,Mom has physically abused me cuz I said that I want to take my hijab off,"&amp;#x200B;

Last week I said my mom that I want to take my hijab off. She did not let me to do that. And she beated me, and said she won't let me to go to school. However before I asked my mom, I went school without hijab. Btw she doesn't know that I took the hijab off at school. I wear it when I come back to house. There's no way that I will start wear the hijab again. My question is that when should I say her I took my hijab off at school and I cannot wear it again? And should I talk about my problems with my close school teacher? What he can do about it? Im fucking scared of my mom beating me again. Im 17, im in my junior year of high school."

depression,Having problems with a depressed friend and my own mental health,"

Soo, I have a pretty long story to tell and I’m grateful for anyone who’ll read this entire thing.
I’m likely not going to get counseling  from and expert any time soon but I feel like I seriously need an opinion from an outsider.
A few weeks ago, I decided to take a break from a depressed friend of mine.
We’ve known each other for almost three years.
At the start he was very friendly, although a bit shy, but I had already noticed that he had a rather violent type of personality, not because he liked fighting, but because he got/get angry easily and more than one he told me that he liked arguing with people (not sure if he intendere arguing as fighting verbally or having a discussion with someone). After that things started to degenerate a bit. After he tried to commit suicide and found out he had depression, immediately he misinterpreted some words that I told him and he realized only after two days.
Then he found out to be trans and started to have very noticeable dysphoria attacks very frequently and even now sometimes he gets angry whenever he believes someone is misgendering him(which to be fair is actually understandable, as those people know him to be trans).
But then he started to meet new people more similar to him and the more he knew the more fights he got in.
It was rather bad especially in relationships, because up until now he’s never had a stable one and one time he even lashed out very badly on one of his exes. Not to say that even in class his mood is like 85% of the time negative and a few times he started screaming in class due ti his fight and more often than not he ends up crying for various reasons.
Now, I’ve tried to help him, I genuinely did by trying to listening to him whenever he needed to talk to someone but three weeks ago I felt like I reached my limit. I couldn’t stand his problems, his crying and everything. It started to seriously affect my mood and I felt like I wasn’t treating my other friends with the respect and care that I had before.
Then again, when I asked him for the break, I knew he was going thorough a very hard time, as he found out he had major depression and was going to change his medicines in a few days.
At the really start I didn’t even know why I felt like that, I just knew I needed to stop seeing him, at last for a little bit. We ended up deciding that we’d ignore each other at school and perhaps see each other outside in the future, but then I broke my own request and started to talk to him at school for no clear reason(which gave him false hopes). Now I seriously regret talking to him that one day, because when I asked him again not to talk to each other for a bit, it started to get scary. The next day, due to something that happened to him and a misinterpretation of a few things that I did during the day, he sent me some scary messanges.
In some he was just venting his anger, but a couple of them were terrifying.
He told me to stop being friendly with him in front of the teachers(which I really couldn’t understand at all, but then when I did, I felt kind of shattered, because wow, he really seemed to have a very low opinion of me…) and that in three years he wouldn’t be there anymore regardless, which almost looked like he wanted to kill himself in three years.
I’ve been feeling mixed emotions: guilt, anger, sadness and anxiety. Now every time I see him at school I feel so scared and I cannot understand why exactly.
Now I feel like it’s even tougher than before, even tho he’s kinda tried to approach me again, but I just couldn’t stand being near him.

It’s been a couple of weeks since he last came to school, so he’s going to loose the year for sure, I’ve played a huge part in his decision, which doesn’t make me feel good at all and now I’m just very conflicted with myself, because I feel like if I had’t asked for the break perhaps things would have taken a better turn.

depression,I don't know if I've gotten better or worse,"I've had a very intense fear of death for decades. Mostly because of my fear of hell. I've also had depression and ADD too my whole life. Lately through its different. Maybe therapy and facing my fears has allowed me to not be as afraid. As well as not being as scared of hell. But the only thing is I don't really care anymore. I have tried to be happy in the moment and not strive for false security. I thinknive succeeded. So now I'm not motivated to do anything.  I don't care if I die. I could find out I'm dying tomorrow and I'd be happy. But my sink is a mess and I don't care. My life is a mess but I don't care. Why should I strive? 

I'm like the guy in office space who just said he'd do nothing lol. Maybe my depression is so bad and I've stopped struggling?  It's weird."
depression,Why am I still alive even though I want to die?,I planned to die today but nothing went the way I planned. I hate it here but why am I still here. I have no more dreams and I feel nothing. Im useless with no purpose. Every morning I wake up with a heavy feeling in my chest and anxiety that petrifies my entire body. I’m getting worse not better. And I’m so damn exhausted.
depression,"forgetting everything , life sucks",[removed]
depression,The universe is punishing me for being born.,Every Single time I try to do something to make myself happy something comes up and destroy's it. Today I wanted to go see  the bob's burgers movie with my mom and now I can't go because an emergency came up with one of her stupid useless crazy friends. I already ordered the tickets and I cannot cancel them so now I am out 26 dollars and I don't even want to watch the movie anymore because I just feel so fucking defeated and hopeless.  I know this seems like it should be a small issue but it is just one more disappointment in a parade of me trying to do something to make myself happy and it not working out because of something outside of my control. I am done trying I am just going to submit to the depression because clearly the universe is completely against me ever being happy.
depression,Seems the other way,"I am in therapy, and a constant theme is that I avoid/abuse things to have a coping mechanism to deal with my emotions.

But the more I think the more sometimes I come to conclude that ""regulars"" have the highest coping mechanism against reality.
This ""routine"" that is always adviced in order to fill up more time and do less thinking, become more routinized into a machine like state.
Sex/friends and etc, everything that is just temporary happiness.
Partners?Meh.

Everything is a remedy to avoid seeing how our existence is objectively meaningless, everything to be done for nothing, no one to remember, no one to know, everything achieved now will be gone in less than a blink of an eye in the time scale of the universe.

I find that there is really just no way to argue against this, this is just the truth at the bottom of it. Sure yada yada find your own meaning and use your time here, whatever it does for you, I am cool, but doesnt change all of these hours are with no meaning in the grande scale."
depression,18 venting and reaching out for help,"I was first put on meds for depression and anxiety by a doctor(walk in vist) a couple years of ago. I quit those within a month and a half cold turkey due to side effects that I couldn't handle. I've been in therapy for around 5 months and have told coaches which have always tried to help. My family knows but everyone in my family thinks it normal because everyone suffers from depression, anxiety, and many more mental illnesses. My home environment isnt the best with an alcoholic narcissistic father from a small village  in Mexico. He and others in my family came here and survived through crime but my dad never did it for money just pride which hes told me many times. My mother is still young at heart, I can see it which makes sense because of having her first child at 19 then being widowed a few years later. Her being young at heart I can deal with. The manipulation, chaos, double standards she could bring I can't. I can't handle either really Its like im walking in a sleeping snake pit because im waiting to get bit from my  mom lying for sympathy or my dad trying to boost his ego. I've played sports since a young age and always being slightly taller than average and being athletic for my age landed me on football,basketball, and track rosters(going to run in college). My parents never went to many events, my dad probably went to a dozen of these over 6 years while having days off to go. My mom was better she went when she could and always brought others if she could. Recently I lost a close friend who i grew up with and played mutiple sports was killed in a drunk driving accident. Im not really over it because I never processed the other deaths in my life. Anyways I had to compete at state with these feelings they didn't affect me negatively but after my last race it defeat brought emotions and does now thinking about it. I never really cry in general especially in front of my parents but i couldn't stop myself on the floor that was over looking the stadium. My parents and family tired to help in there own ways and it showed me they care but can't show it. I know they love me but they never show it because of their mental illnesses and their own troubles. Its just hard to love someone who constantly compare their bad lives to the amazing one they have given you. My dad while drunk has always told me how he hated his dad for never showing support or love and how he was an alcoholic asshole. My mom is a badass tbh she worked from a young age and grew up just as her mom was immigrating legally to America. She grew up poor redneck that loved to party and has told me stories. Yet here I am forced to work from a young age with getting my first job at 11-12 which was unpaid. I was forced to wash dishes and help serve food because my mom was doing more than what she was paid for and needed someone to help her run the restaurant while she ran the bar. So it was me and my sister in the restaurant  and my mom in the bar with my lil sister sometimes joining just as a cute face. They were both paid while i got nothing not even tips and even got yelled at when asking when I was going to be paid. While we were working my dad was in the bar drinking and my shift would end whenever he was to drunk to walk so I could help him home.

I know I have issues and it takes time to heal and recover but I have a life to live and want to take the right steps. If anyone has tips or anything at all that can help it would be greatly appreciated.

Also sorry for grammer I randomly woke up  and wrote this"

depression,"Despite actively trying to make my life better, it's just not the same without people to share it with.","I know what I want out of life, but I don't have anyone to share it with. Today I am having a bit of day out, because you should just treat yourself now and then, that's what I think. 

But while this feeling of living life is a pleasant experience, it's just not the same unless you have someone to share it with.

I frantically messaged people I know just to update them on my day just to fill that small void.

I appreciate now what I do for me. I just wish I had people to share it with. It's hard to make friends as you get older.

One time a dude forced his way into my life (god bless his ADHD lol) and we became best friends, but then he moved away overseas and it's just not the same, he was the only person who appreciated life in a wider context like myself.

If only I could find a life partner like that."
depression,i feel like a burden,"I don't know if I have depression or not but just wanted to went my frustration on someone and found this. 

I don't even know why Im living anymore, despite being only 17, I feel so hopeless and uninterested in everything and my social anxiety doesn't help me a bit. My songs literally push me everyday to live. 

Being overweight is one of the main reasons of my sadness and I know it and it's not easy to just lose weight. My parents despite being very supportive of me, they give me lectures of my negative points every single day. I mean, Im overweight, not a bright student, I even have a lisp and my social anxiety prevents me to do even daily activities that a normal girl my age can do. Every time my parents look at me with disappointment I die a little bit inside. I don't want to even live anymore. I feel like everything is so unfair to me. Like, I have to put extra effort into everything that other people can do easily. I hate to meet my cousins and extended family as they all are overachievers and successful. Not only I feel out of place with my family but also with my own parents who are fit and have goals in life unlike me. Everyday my parents repeat the same thing, my mother says, 'lose weight' and my father says 'get rid of that lisp' 

It's not easy, no matter how much I practice in front of a mirror, my lisp is not going away, and my weight... I don't even eat any junk food or literally, I eat only two times a day or sometimes even once in a day. And doing exercise is easy to say but very hard to do. I don't know why I can never follow my exercise routine for more than ten days. It's just hard and I even suffer from a back pain.

Just what is wrong with me? I feel like a burden to my parents and family and even to this planet. 

And my parents famous dialogue in all of this is, ""You're like this because of your phone once we get rid of it you'll be fine.""

No! I wouldn't be. I am not addicted to my phone but I can only function while listening to my songs, it helps with my anxiety and they don't get it. 

I just hate myself and I wish I'll die quickly."
depression,Really at a loss of how to move forward,"Hey all. I guess I'm looking for advice? I'm not sure any more. I am on thin ice at work for missing too many days, but had to call out today again because I got ready to commit suicide before work. It caused a huge break with my husband, and technically I violated the attendance policy at work, meaning I most likely lost my job. The stress on top of the already agitated depression has me spiraling. I put in for a medical leave at work for a week, hoping it keeps me from being fired and gives me sometime to try to truly seek help, but I don't know how or where. I also can't go back to work without a medical release (saying I'm fit to return to work) and I don't have insurance or money to pay for a doctor by the end of the week. 

I'm so stressed. I'm so lost. I feel so paralyzed, wondering if I made the right decision. I don't know what to do."
depression,"i feel like im inherently worthless and a waste of space, time and resources","so to get it out of the way, i have a mixed diagnosis of bpd n npd, alongside depression n cptsd.

im in my early 20s, am the product of rape n domestic violence and partially the reason why my parents struggle a lot financially now (my mom had me when she was young and she and her boyfriend, now my dad, stopped everything in their lives to raise me).
 
have never had a ""real"" job, just a couple of gigs here and there to help with the bills.

still living with my parents.

have dated a couple of people before, not even a handful, and they always say i didn't actually do anything wrong but they just werent attracted to me that way. never spoken to most of them since, and now i have only one friend of 4 years. 

right now, in this moment, I feel like the most logical solution would be to disappear out of everyone's lives cus i either dont make a great difference to them or I fuck things up to an extreme level- when I was younger i abused a friend, and a cousin. 

ive been abused for most of my life n have developed not just a pd but a series of other things that now concern my parents n makes them waste their money on me.

have tried to kill myself a couple of times n ended up in the hospital once.

the only reason im alive rn its cus i havent found an effective way of ending everything, n cus i know my parents n possibly my dog would never recover from this. but at the same time i don't know how i can improve my life and stop being so damn...irrelevant to people, other than the ones that raised me lmao. i love my family a great deal and i have improved tremendously since first getting diagnosed 5 years ago, to the point my friend still wont believe me when I say i have npd. i just...dont know what makes me so undesirable to other people, in every single way. i don't know what im doing wrong.
 everyone has friends and partners and colleagues, and these people have good reasons for loving them and im just here cus my mom couldn't get an abortion n my dad wanted to share the burden of raising me with her. they're great people and bc of that they wont tell me im a burden but i know I am, just for being alive. 

i don't really know what to do n honestly i just really need a friend. i wanted someone to tell me i have worth and can work this out but i know i personally would never say that to someone like me, who has done the things i did and has the personality i have. i dont knwo what to do anymore since I've tried everything to change my life n it hasn't worked"
depression,10+ years of rejection,"I am almost 35 years old, failed miserably at dating or finding a partner.

**General Note:** that I am an introvert to going out and speaking to strangers, specifically women, is not an easy thing for me to do.

**English** is not my first language, so excuse my mistakes if there are 

Since 2010 after college I tried to find a partner for me, every attempt failed miserably.

**Attempt #1:** a girl I knew from college, and we're close friends at the time, I tried to bring the topic that I am interested…etc, she politely apologized and of course our friendship ruined after that, 

This is not the worst part, a close friend of mine was dating her already and I didn't know, during the same month of her rejecting me, he kept calling me while I am depressed so after a while I answered, and he told me he's preparing his proposal to her, I tried to apologize, but he insisted and refused all my excused, ""the worst part coming right now"", during 1 month I got rejected from a girl liked but also watched her say yes to very close friend while me holding the sign ""will you marry me"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Attempt #2:** around 2013 it took me a while to get over attempt 1, a couple of years after I still have connection from college there were another girl from college also I was close to and friends, I invited her over a coffee and brought up that I am interested 

\*\* note that since 2010, and before I've known that second girl and always in contact with her, so I am not just jumping and bringing the topic to a girl I didn't speak for a while\*\*

Suddenly after I brought up that I am interested she started yelling and screaming how you do that to me, what did I do to make you think that way, why do you do that to me (those were her exact words) and it was a big scene, clearly I went into a depression for a while because of how bad the situation were, in addition to bad experience 1.

**Attempt #3:**  around 2016 all my circle were either immigrated to other countries married or engaged so all my circle is out, close circle to be accurate, now I am all alone, so tired of being alone, so I thought of trying blind dates were set up through common friends or family members. Etc, so clearly we're meeting for a relationship purposes.

I met this girl and then stated chatting for almost 2 hours it was rough to be honest, but I thought maybe she was shy or something or not comfortable. Gave her a call, and then she said you're like a brother to me... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Attempt #4:** I tried bling dates again, and it was a disaster that final girl I tried to meet with there were huge major ideological difference that will make life a disaster, she was sweet and kind though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dating Apps:** I have been on dating apps for over 10 years I got matched twice, both of these 2 girls unmatched within the first 24 hrs.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my self-confidence is destroyed, feeling very lonely at almost 35, thought of suicide multiple times and attempted 1 and failed, feeling of rejection by all girls is overwhelming, not a single girl showed /showing interest in me in all my years, I feel so ugly  I don't know what to do, loneliness is eating me alive,"
depression,I’m losing my mind,Two weeks waves on waves of sadness. Fuck I miss her. Fuck I’m lost in life. Fuck I wish I had someone to help me. I’m so lost in my life. I’m fucking 30 with no sense of direction. Idk what to do. I’m losing. I’m losing it.

depression,why do I not look forward to my future?,"So to go ahead and say I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm taking an antidepressant. I've been taking it for 9 weeks and for 5 weeks I felt okay to live and didn't have as many depressing thoughts. Now I have almost had them this whole week for a full day. Also everyone is graduating at my job and some of the people I am friends with, and  next year I will graduate. People who are juniors are really looking forward to graduating and I literally don't give a shit about it. I'm not excited and honestly I'm not looking forward to it. I also have no motivation to find a college or find a career. I just feel like once I'm 18 that my life will automatically be shit and I have nothing to look forward to. I want to feel excited about graduation, college, and life in general but I just can't. So my question is, is this still depression even though my medication worked for 5 weeks?"

The fact that people are leaving me behind specially that girl that I really liked left me hanging. It's just depressing for me. I feel small, and useless to everyone. I've been comparing myself to the person that he really likes, Sociable, kind, friendly, adored by many. And I'm just useless to her. My time and effort that i gave on her, all for nothing. And also my friend just have trust issues with me now, Even though i didn't do anything to destroy her trust. I don't know now. I lost my motivation. I'm trying to find my happiness through internet, even in the real world. But I just couldn't find it. Is what you always get when you love someone?

depression,Heartbreak from years ago still affects my life.,"Hey guys, I (m, 30) had my heart broken by a girl I loved in 2012 and then stupidly stuck around as her friend (that old stupid hope that she'd change her mind) until she found a bf in 2015 when I finally cut her out of my life.

I won't go into too many details, but to make it short this girl was basically using me emotionally and physically and had no actual romantic feelings for me. She would put me down a lot, and was extremely promiscuous outside of whatever we had. Despite this, I still loved her. I have never felt closer to anyone before or since.

My confidence has never recovered, and I already suffered from low self esteem but was hopeful. She basically confirmed my fears that I'm inadequate and not worth someone else's love. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough as a man to attract a woman and keep her interested. My first thoughts when I like someone are ""you have no chance, she'll get with someone better"". 

I'm so lonely, the pain from what happened in the past drags me down, and sometimes it can be extremely debilitating. I've basically given up. 

I need help."

depression,a glass dome,"Depression is a glass dome. You are sitting in it. There's no way out. The oxygen is limited. You can breathe, but barely. You looked out. All 360 degrees you see. There's nothing in the way of your sight. And you stare at everything that is happening around you. 

You see your family. You see your friends. They are going about their lives.

You witnessed your best friend's wedding. You smiled and you felt the joy that everyone was experiencing together. 

You then watched another friend give birth. Oh! so cute, that little girl. or that little boy. That small little family looks so perfect and...whole. 

You look at yourself. In the glass dome. You smile. It's alright. You have everything you need and want for now. A happy marriage. Your own home. 

You watched as your friend's little one grow up. ""Aunty! look at me!"", the little one shouted from outside. You waved, you smiled. 

Then you heard a loud knock. Your best friend, your cousin, your friends. They all knocked on the glass dome and said ""look you! over here!"" They stand with their families. Their careers. Their travels. Their awards. Their recognitions. 

They waved and they started looking smaller and smaller. It's as though they were on a travellator, moving away at a constant pace. They became smaller and smaller. Their backs facing you, only with some heads turned, stretching their necks hard and far, so that they can catch the last glimpse of you.

And then you breathed. and realised that the air is limited. You looked out the glass dome. It is dark and empty. You tried to break out so that you can run after them. You hit the glass, you screamed, you threw things against it. And it cracked. but it did not break. 

You fell back onto the ground. You kept calling out for them. But it continued to stay dark...and quiet. 

And then, you are alone."
depression,Just a rant,"Can't sleep. Life's keeping me up. Basically, everyone throughout my life has been calling me a faggot. I had selective mutism in highschool. I couldn't talk. My dad growing up would make copious amounts of fun of me. That's the root cause of everything. I didn't learn to speak my parents language properly. My cousin's hate me. I didn't get to have fun in life. Life's come to a dead end. University won't get me employed. My neighbour, I still remember, said ""fuck you"" ""loner ass bitch"" and tried shooting me. I got made fun of on the bus. Fuck even is my life. Fucks even the point of this bullshit. Fuck my cousins. Fuck India. And fuck this midget of a rapist fuckass neighbour. Idek I'm such a disgrace I don't even feel like leaving my house and now I finally understand it all. The shit I should've been taught when I was younger but wasn't because I have a loser ass fucking family."
depression,I live and have lived such a pathetic and sad life,"I have no one to talk to, no where to go about this so I’ll dump this on you guys, hopefully that’s okay.

I try to live a good and fun life, and I have in the past but nothing is really fun anymore, and the fun I can have is pathetic and I’m lying to myself thinking I’m having a good time anymore. I just really miss my childhood, childhood friends and even highschool a little bit.

Highschool was the worst for me, I just graduated last year and as much as I’m truly glad to be out into the true world I regret a lot about it. Being surrounded by people and being antisocial, smoking my brains out making me even more stupid then I was before, only having 1 close friend those 3 years. I had all this opportunity and I wasted it. During high-school, after I graduated and now I barely had any true fun, I hate how I enjoy myself now and with other now, it’s just boring and a waste of time to me 

I moved 4 months ago across the country to start my career I’ve wanted sense I was 11 and as much as that makes me happy, I don’t have time to do anything. Everything has been stacked against me for what feels like a long time but lately it seems like I can’t catch a single break, not 1 thing that goes in my way so I can get 1 less thing off my brain. Oh these 10 things are in your way of accomplishing something that you have no control over? well we have a few more to add. That or one of those 10 things gets worst and worst, it’s unbelievable how stressful shit keeps getting.

That’s all I need is 1 little thing to take some weight off my shoulders, idk we’ll see how it goes hopefully something positive will happen eventually and I can use that to calm my head down.

Oh and a little thing, this job and especially my living situation is strictly no smoking or drinking. No smoking doesn’t bother me, but not being able to sit back and have a drink once a month is excessive IMO. I understand people binge drinking or drinking all the time and that being a problem, but I just want a drink to relax, take a load off and not have my sober mind to overthink everything. Especially after working my ass off these past 4 months and feeling like I’m getting no where. Is what it is

Thank you have a good night/day"
depression,Any new treatment options for Depression pop up in the last year or so? Any promising treatment options coming in the near future?,"Just curious. I haven't been in the mental health subreddits anywhere near as much as I was a few years ago. I (36/M) have tried about everything for depression over the past decade, and never found much relief. 

thanks!"
depression,Looking back on Past Experience,"I was a victim of Depression as-well, let me tell you something about it. It wasn’t a quick chilly Rain, No, It was a long hard winter that set off before I got a phone. It started the moment my parents undressed me naked and threw me out our apartment room for people to see. And why? Because I didn’t give the teacher my Homework. Although I didn’t understand then, But it sowed the seeds. You see, I would’ve actually killed myself if I didn’t have Social Media, In it I found friends, People who cared. People who every time I even mentioned self harm would talk me off the Ledge and then tell me that I *Mattered*. I’m grateful for those people. And on the other Hand, I went to see this piece of shit Therapist at a Hospital who devalued my feelings, didn't bother to listen to me, Mostly talked to my parents without me in the room (I AM THE PATIENT!) and was a general asshole. He was like ‘There have been 100s of people in that chair before you, So I know better and shut up’.  I still have some problems with it today but I’m proud of myself and thank Social Media. Sure, It can be destructive but Great aswell.

My parents still act like it didn’t matter.


Also, Asshole therapist should loose his license."
depression,Pain and sadness are the only things that feel real,"Sometimes I want to live without it, but even if I magically could cure my depression I would feel fake. This is who I am. I can run and I can hide as much as I want, I can fuck myself up with drugs as much as I want, but I can't escape the fact that I'll always be this depressed fucking mess of a human.

I don't know how it began, but I sure know how it ends."
depression,Does anyone know where you can find positive news?,[removed]
depression,I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna survive the next few months,"So I'm currently in the process of redefining my relationship, I probably won't be able to find the strength to actually leave, but I'm not going to go without sex anymore. Probably more worryingly, we've become co-dependent, so we are staying together and have been staying together even when the relationship isn't working.

Ironically, as of the past few days I don't even want to fuck anymore, just as the opportunity is finally arising. So I've ruined my fucking relationship for no reason, great. That will probably change in a few days knowing me but who knows. 

I might just not be able to even think of sex without all of these fucking feelings coming back up, it's already happened to the point where I don't even really enjoy jerking off or porn anymore because of all of the negative feelings it conjures up.

My university counselor cancelled (I don't even fucking go to classes anymore beyond just doing the assignments) and it's in like 2 weeks, and I am going to see an actual psychologist (btw, what is the difference between psychologist and therapist?)  as well, but the wait list is probably going to be months. I seriously don't know how I'm going to deal with the stress of everything, no matter the outcome."
depression,It disturbs me that I can't be sane if I don't have a purpose,"That's all.  I give up.  All I want is to be content.  Monkey on my back, always.  Weight.. emotional stuff, damaging.. Now I'm a wasteland of possibilities ashed out washed up chunks of dead and dying oh yeah ..."
depression,How do people get up everyday knowing it's all pointless?,"I've recently adhered to the idea that nothing really matters since at the end of the day eventually the world will just stop existing. All the stuff we struggle for and worry about is small. I know we're supposed to make the best of it and enjoy what we have but I have nothing to really live for.

I wake up lie in bed for a few hours, go to work, come home shower, brush my teeth, find something to do for a while then get some sleep. Wake up and repeat. The only things I enjoy are eating and jerking off. I just kind of exist at this point.

I hate this shit so much."

depression,INEXPLICABLE,"The birds have travelled far and long
To hear me craft a perfect tune.
But a woman dressed in repulse and sly
Whispers me an insidious lullaby.
She paralysed me,made my vocals slurry.
And I collapsed, striking a single note
That echoed a monochrome so prosaic.
She lured in a entire town's fleas
Besides threatening my timid heart, wrapped in oblivion
And my whimsical black and white keys.

She sat and ripped out my senses
 Like petals of a rose
My clarity,my awareness,my sense of judgement and gratitude,everything froze.
She made me wear a blindfold 
That sat there on my skin till it infused,
Draping my vision and shutting the world out,
Leaving everything blurried and confused.
The sickness fed on my flesh and I craved to feel my face,
No prayer,no drug,no shrink could help me scrub it off my head.
Inch by inch,the poison had branched into my core that ached.

She tricked me into a room that smelled of rot and deceit.
The walls engulfed in chaotic grey mold
Enclosed each day by a feet.
The void of darkness and numb 
Was occassionally meddled with pain and sorrow.
Sometimes,like a saw slowly grinding back and forth on my body.
And on other times,like a sudden slash of an axe on my brain
Cracking it open and leaving me to drain.

My legs got rooted in the cold dead floor
And the spiteful air choked me.
I desperately hunted for a door.
I resorted to every possible distraction
I glued my useless eyes to a tiny neon screen 
And shoved my mouth with food I couldn't taste.
Please let me out of this disdain
To breathe again,think again,live again.

Finally I see your face,at the end of the tunnel.
But you ask me, 'Is it that unbearable?
You're just being weak and superficial.'
I collapse again with just a wonder 
Which part of this whole drama is hell.
My suffering? Or my inability to express it
To people I love the most?
Who point me at the culprit,as 'her'.
Who accuse me of an imaginary crime.
I realise I need to pay my cost 
Forming apologies to your countless blames
And garnishing explainations to your plates of gossips 
Throwing away my time to heal in flames.

It's a slippery slope
And I'm back at her feet
In the pit of depression and lifelessness
Where a million trains of thoughts crash against each other
Oh! What a massacre to watch!

It's a gigantic loop.
And I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired.
I'd do anything to get out of it.
Yet I can't do anything to get out of it.

depression,I can’t take this anymore,It hurts way too much. I want to bash my head on a wall till I bleed. I want to cut my arms or legs. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I hate this. But I can’t. I can’t let my parents down like this. But that makes me feel even worse. They’re so kind and caring. I feel like shit. I want to give up. I feel so hopeless It makes me sick. I feel so empty I can’t even focus in school. I haven’t even done work in weeks. The antidepressants don’t work anymore. So what’s the point
depression,My psychiatrist slept with me then discarded me like trash. What shall I do?!,"I’ve been seeing this psychiatrist for months before she decided to ruin everything just to satisfy her needs.  It was my first ever psychiatrist and I was seeing her for my sever depression, anxiety, and PTSD.  She’s about 10 years older than I am with over 25 years of experience in this field. To be fair, initially i was benefiting from the sessions and things were heading in the right direction.  During all this, she was going through a divorce and her mind was all over the place.  Long story short, after a few months of seeing her, somehow I had a feeling that she’s into me but I ignored it because my mental health was my priority and the last thing I wanted was to cause myself even more harm by ruining my relationship with my doctor.  After months of trying to convince me to go out with her for a drink (her excuse was to observe how I behave in social settings) I agreed and went for it.  We both got a little tipsy and then she asked me if I wanted to have sex with her.  I agreed to it after a while and we booked a room and had sex a few times.  After that night she started telling me that she loves me and wanted to hang out again the following night to have sex.  I was hesitant at first but then went ahead with it.  I know I should’ve put a stop to it immediately but being very vulnerable and in such a messed up state of mind I wasn’t thinking and done what she wanted me to do.  She kept repeating the words “it’s ok you can trust me” the whole time but deep down I knew it was wrong.  After that night, I had an appointment with her a couple of days later and I decided to tell her how I felt and whatever is going on has to stop because I didn’t want to ruin the doctor-patient relationship with her and my mental health is my priority and it’s what I’m hear for.  She could tell how much it was bothering me and the amount of anxiety it was causing but she didn’t care and kept on trying.  I kept trying to explain to her that it is wrong and it’s affecting my progress but she didn’t cate about how I felt whatsoever.  Eventually she got the point and stopped but it came at a cost.  She didn’t care anymore about my mental health and her personality just changed towards me.  Basically, she neglected me and started treating me like trash.  It reached the point where I would text her that I’m suicidal and her reply would be “oh boy” and just ignore me.  Eventually i decided to leave her and look for another psychiatrist.  After this experience, I have a lot of resentment towards her and I’m consumed with anger because of her unprofessionalism and what she put me through.  I’m also angry about the fact that she knew how severe my mental illness was but she still put her needs first and actually today my condition is worse because of her.  Just FYI, I spent over USD 10k on treatment with her and this is what I got from supposedly the best psychiatrist in my country.  Today, my hatred towards her is extreme and a part of me can’t let go of the shit she put me through.  What shall I do?!"
depression,Can’t seem to get my life together despite having help with therapy and medication. More in body. Any insight will be helpful.,"Every time I pull myself out of my depression hole and start working on myself, something happens like a fight with SO and I regress instantly.

To elaborate, I’ve been in therapy and on meds which seem to help. My therapist is amazing and we have made lots of progress. I feel empowered after a session and have the desire to get my shit together but then some shit goes down irl and I regress into a dysfunctional ball of mass, incapable of doing anything. 


I cry too much, I stay in bed and my heat rate shoots up. I feel like my inability to handle a roadblock or a setback keeps in the depression loop. 

Does anyone have any insight to offer.

I’m on Quetiapine and sertraline and doing mentalisation based therapy after having done DBT in past. 

I am a smart person otherwise, with a masters in engineering and I feel like I’m wasting all my potential away. I oscillate between berating myself and pitying.

This is prob the last thing i ever write lol"
depression,"I give up, i can't trust anyone","I've no trust in my family to talk to them about anything, I have one friend who basically only talks to me because we work together, and basically all other friends are and have been online.

I can't trust them, everyone I talk to just ghosts me 74 people in the last two years, like 9 in the last few months.

No matter how genuine I am, no matter how hard I try to be different, or change, they just stop responding randomly, slowly taking longer and longer, short responses...eventually people just leave, no matter how long we talk 

It doesn't matter what they say anymore, I've heard every promise, every ""I wouldn't do that"" variation, every ""I like talking to you"", 

Nothing but lies baiting me to make me feel good or something.

I'm tired, I'm so afraid of going back to the absolute silence of having literally zero people to go to, for anything...but at this point I literally just don't believe people or trust anyone about anything they say about me or our relationship.

I know nobody cares, nobody read this, and I'm just talking to myself...but it's not like I have anyone else.

I'm done, from now on I will just isolate myself again, no more believing people."
depression,Not sure how it gets better,This is my first time posting. I just don’t know how things will ever feel better in my life. I’m 26 and I hate myself. I cringe at everything I say and do. Any time I recall something embarrassing or painful I verbally say some variation of “I wish I was dead”. It’s literally become a reflex at this point. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished anything and all I ever do is think about how great my life could have been if I had done it differently. I don’t want to die I just want a do-over. Every social situation makes me feel anxious. I stay home as often as I can. I don’t have any friends. Any friends that I did have dumped me years ago and never looked back. I don’t know if anyone outside my family has ever really cared about me. How am I supposed to like myself when no one else does? Doesn’t that make me a bad person? I just don’t see a way for this pain to ever go away. I have great parents who gave me a great life and so many other privileges. Do I even deserve to feel this way? Or am I just making excuses for being a lesser person?
depression,Why are relationships so tiring?,"Like, don’t get me wrong, it’s amazing to have someone there for you, either a good friend, partner, family member, etc. Having any kind of good relationship with someone is amazing. 

But it’s also so tiresome, like it’s weighing me down. Having someone to care for you and there for you and all that good shit relationships bring with them, it’s just too much and too tiring.

depression,"""the deep red of the deserving""","Trigger warning: self harm 

This is a journal entry I found today. Must've been 16 years old when I wrote this. I still struggle with my depression and anxiety, but the self harm is at bay for now. This entry took me back to that time and I honestly just thought it was interesting and thought you might too. Buckle down if you want, she's lengthy 

""It does not end. It is a column of negative thoughts. A list of bullet points that stretches it's limbs for a thousand miles, and though unseen, never unheard. 

Far from unheard, the list repeats, each time adding a new point. With every repetition, the weight becomes heavier, the shadow grasping at my throat becomes tighter, and within my stomach, I feel something new begin to fester. As each second passes, it's as if a quarter is being dropped into the pit of my stomach. The weight adds until minutes later, its as if there's hundreds of quarters resting themselves inside of my stomach. All that im able to do is heave, waiting for something to come up, but it's never a feeling of release. 

While the weight lie atop my chest, while the shadow grips my throat, while the quarters multiply, I am blind. My vision impaired, blurred from the overflow of liquid spilling over in a myriad of weight, what feels like gallons fill my eyes. The salty taste of my tears reaching the corners of my lips, demanding entrance. I am blind. The dim light shines through, but I am blind. 

I rub at my eyes endlessly, but the tears only come back. They reappear in multiples, and so I sit. All of the symptoms adding on top of eachother with no remedy in sight. I sit with my face flat on my bed, eyes still open. I sit contemplating, as I finally see a remedy. 

The scars on my wrist, they speak for themselves. They tell a story of a girl with nowhere to go. No 'up' to jump to, no 'down' to fall. A girl who only sees one option. To place a blade upon her bare skin, and pull. To watch as her skin splits apart, watch as the blade tints in color, watch as the blood pools in the divot she's created. The deep red of the deserving."""
depression,Trapped,"I've been depressed many times in my life but not to this extent right now. I'm newly prescribed citalopram and 3 weeks in so maybe that has something to do with my current mindset. I live in at my place of work which is in the middle of nowhere, approximately 40 mins to nearest town which is the 1st thing that makes me feel trapped. Secondly I don't have my own transportation at the moment. Third I'm struggling to find anything in common with my colleagues and the fourth thing making me feel trapped is I don't have enough money to move away or get my own place (I share the accomodation). I know these things can change with time but it's an overwhelming feeling that spirals out of control. Anybody in a similar situation that managed to overcome the feeling of utter dread? TIA"
depression,"Really don’t know where else to post this, TW","My dad is taking me out shooting on may 5th for my birthday and I almost don’t want to go as I don’t know how I’m going to resist shooting myself. I have really bad panic attacks very often and I’m really impulsive during them, hell part of me even now wants to go just so I can kill myself easily. I don’t know how to tell my dad that I don’t want to go shoot guns, I’ve always thought it would be fun but now that it’s coming up I don’t know if it’s a good idea… he’s really excited to go as well and I can’t bring myself to tell him I just don’t want to go. It’s not like I can tell him “hey, I don’t want to go the shooting range because I’m going to shoot myself if I do”. What do I do?"
depression,I just wanna disappear,"Not in the sense of dying (altho it would also be greatly appreciated) but in the sense of deleting all social media, all contacts, changing phone number, moving to somewhere no one knows and leaving it all behind, the people, the memories, the everything. 

I’m just so tired of everything, of people, of relationships, of life, of everything.

But at the same time I know it’s selfish, I know there are people who care about me and I care about them too, and it would be selfish to just disappear from the radar for some time or forever. But they’d get over it eventually, I’m not someone that is worth crying over, I’m forgettable. 

I just don’t know what to do. I wanna disappear. I wanna be selfish for once, but I don’t know."
depression,Overdosing doesn't end well,"I'm not sure what was going through my mind but yesterday night I ended up taking all the paracetamol i had (12-13 approx.) I honestly just just didn't want to wake up anymore. I wanted a break from everything, temporary or permanent. But I woke up and was feeling really nauseous. I ended up puking some 20 times in total. The doctor asked what did u eat and stuff but it didn't make sense as to why I was puking so much. I couldn't tell them that I tried to overdose myself coz if they knew, my mom would also come to know and it might hurt her a lot. And I might end up in a mental hospital. Honestly, I don't mind going to mental hospital, atleast I'll get a break from everything for while, as long as my mom wouldn't know about it. I love my mom but I just can't anymore."
depression,I feel no interest in living,"Even when I feel ""okay"" I could still say I have no interest. I could be doing the most fun thing in the world and I still would rather not exist at all. I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for the last 6 years, since I was 13. I had a wonderful childhood and I don't have any horrible trauma, but I was still cursed with this horrible disease. Im assuming it's genetic because I have to rely on medicine just to feel somewhat normal. I have so much trouble handling my emotions, they are the bane of my existence and the most troublesome thing I have in my life. I'm constsntly irritable and on edge all of the time, I don't remember a moment in the last few years where I wasn't. I'm 3 weeks away from graduating highschool and I haven't been able to get up and go to school for the past 2 or 3 weeks. I just want to lay in bed and live out my ""fantasy"" of not existing. Sleeping is the closest I can get to that without actually taking my life. I don't feel like I belong here at all. Maybe somewhere else but Idk exactly where. I'm starting to convince myself that maybe Im not meant to be here after all. Sometimes I wish I could give my life to someone who's terminally ill and has the desire to live that I don't have. I feel so alone and I don't know if anybody else feels like this."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid to wake up one day in the hospital after a suicide attempt, there are times when the motivation doesn't allow me to do it, and others when it seems like my body is acting on its own. I want to go to the hospital but it won't do any good. They will tell me to go to a psychiatrist, but I don't trust anyone, I'm convinced that deep down I'm worthless and awful. I can't change this belief. When I was on medication, I didn't take it either. I want to continue to isolate myself but that's not a solution either. 

It hurts me to go to school and see people, I feel like an animal, a dog or a deer. Despite all this, I would have thought that I wouldn't feel the pressure to get better and that I would get used to it, but no. I'm skipping whole weeks of classes and I have a math test this afternoon and I don't know what it is about, I feel so many things now : anger, fear, sadness, stress, pain and shame.  I know that I was once like everyone else and I know what it feels like to study and be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I live alone. Even when I make an effort, people tell me I'm different, all day long that's what everyone tells me. I hate knowing that it's possible to heal and I can't. I don't know what I want.

I'm so lazy that I don't work on the things that are causing my problems. I just avoid everything. All I want to do is get away from the things that cause my issues and I can't, so my depression is getting worse.

I wish I wasn't born. I never asked to be born and now I have to live with envy of others who are having great lives and experiences.

I don't relate to anyone where I live, they all want babies and families, a mortgage and 2 cars, the most boring mediocrity that anyone can subject themselves to.

I'm sick of doing normal shit and finding life boring. I have things that I do (horse riding and weightlifting) that should bring me joy but I'm either forcing myself to do them or having only short lived joy that never lasts.

I wish I could be somewhere else but this would mean I have to work on my problems and I just *cannot be bothered*.

depression,rant ig?? if anyone has advice pls give me anything,"so i dont even know where to start, I am 16 and i am also a trans guy, ive been only diagnosed with adhd, anxiety, and depression i think. i used to be in therapy and stuff but it never worked out for me.
im not sure but i think i have been pretty much traumatized in a way over the things ive been through over the past 5ish years or so. i guess i struggle with addiction in a way, i love getting fucked up (havent been as much lately because of severe depression), but anyways i am a heavy weed smoker and im also addicted to nicotine. this probably all started when i was 11-12. i always hung out with older kids and they all did drugs so it got me into alot of really bad shit when i was so young. i mean i am still young, shit. but anyways  yea that led to me having a pill problem for a little while and taking acid way too much for someone whos brain isnt fully developed. 
I was also sexually active pretty young too, and i regret it every single day. i wont go into that as much cus nobody wants to hear about that shit, but i think you get the point. i got myself into some shit a couple times that i am still regretting to this day. 
ive always been poor, so ive gotten really desperate at times for anything i couldnt afford that time, whether be stealing or anything like that. plus i guess i never noticed that i didn’t exactly have the best childhood when i was little either, even though my parents tried hard for me. long story short my dad let this woman move in with us when i was like 7, theyve been broken up for years but she still lives with us. over the years she has probably stolen over $1,000 worth of my belongings, probably more. she is the definition of a narcissistic leach. horrible woman.
anyways, ive dated quite a few people, and every one of them fucked me up even worse. but not like this last one. i thought i found a chill person, but as time went by they got upset when i saw my friends, stole my vapes and tried to force me into quitting nicotine with no support at all, got pissed when i smoked weed, and literally ghosted me after being together for like 7 months. honestly after that relationship i have changed so much, im not the same person and im so angry about it. i am in a relationship right now with someone i love a lot, but i literally do not know how to have a healthy relationship. i mean im definitely learning with her, but i literally just had a 4-6 hour breakdown because she didn’t call me today. and i mean a literal manic breakdown, screaming at her when she couldnt hear me, because i was alone screaming to myself. stopped going out or seeing friends because i just want to hangout with my girlfriend everyday. also struggle daily with being trans and not passing as male, but i could make a whole big post about that.
i just don’t know how to get better and heal from the past so i can have a fun happy life. i just want to have a good day but they don’t happen a lot anymore, and i feel like i have a lot of untreated mental illness.
if you read all of this, thank you, i just needed to talk about this somewhere besides my own head. ❤️
(i definitely didn’t get into everything, cus that would take forever plus thats whats therapists are for lol)"
depression,I feel safe in my depression bubble,"I haven’t had a depressive episode this bad in a long time, kept my up all night thinking about the worst moments of my life and the terrible pressures I’m in now. Everything that’s destroyed me over the past 12 years has been playing through my head, reminding me how much hurt I’ve been through and how it’s changed my life’s direction in ways I would have never thought my life would go. The scary part is that I haven’t felt this safe and comfortable in a long time, waddled up in my blanket holding my teddy bear so tightly on the verge of crying. I feel as if being depressed for so long has made it so my mind and body think that this is a good thing and making me want it more.

depression,Wondering if it's time to get a diagnosis,"Hello everyone, for about a decade I have been living with what I believe to be depression. I have done my research on the topic but of course I can’t be sure of it unless I get a diagnosis.

I’m sorry for the long story but I needed a place to share, I put a tl;dr at the end for anyone interested.

I lost my father to cancer when I was 8 and was abused by my mother’s partner when I was 10; the same partner who stayed with us until I was about 16, when he took his own life. I am currently in university, but I remember feeling extremely low already in my first/second year of High School. My academics achievements were great yet I didn’t feel accomplished, rather I felt like a failure and that the only way I could prove my worth was through my grades. My awkwardness prevented me from having many friends and I tended to isolate myself (not replying to messages from months on end). I had frequent negative thoughts about how no one cared about me and how I would be better off dead, but they were still moderate. I had periods of time where I felt decent, happy even, so it was bearable.

In my second to last year and last year of High School especially it got worse. For context, my class was divided into groups who loathed each other, and I only had 3 real friends, the rest constantly seemed to judge and make me feel worse about myself. I had always felt self-conscious around people from other friend groups, and I tried to keep my distance from them in order not to spiral into self-criticism. Once my group of friends started befriending one of the other groups, the feelings of loneliness became even more present. I couldn’t be myself anymore because my friend’s new acquaintances would make fun of me, say mean comments or hint to me that I wasn’t welcome. In the morning I would arrive late to class in order not to have to deal with anyone and I would rather spend time at home than in school.

The isolation got to me and along with the lack of motivation and passion for anything anymore, a toxic addicting relationship I was going through at the time and the feeling of hopelessness about my future, I started experiencing severe suicidal thoughts. I never actively hurt myself, but my feelings were getting progressively worse, and in the month of February 2020 I had planned to take my own life by jumping in front of train.

The covid national lockdown in my country saved me from doing it.

I went through my last year of high school at home with constant demotivation, an incapability of getting out of bed while perpetually drowning in misery. I had my good days where I could feel happy and loved, and I had my really bad days where the only thing I wanted to do was disappear, not exist, lie in my bed without doing anything at all as the world stays quiet for a single moment. The summer after I finished High School I didn’t feel overjoyed, I simply felt empty. I had no hobbies and grades were (until then) the only basis on which I could prove my worth.

Then I started University online. I didn’t know anyone and felt I could make a fresh start. That wasn’t the case. I developed a sort of anxiety which prevented me from making many friends and I felt even more alone. Fortunately I did talk with some people from uni from time to time but I didn’t form meaningful connections. The stress from the exams was harsh on me and I had less and less motivation each month, yet I did it. I managed to get through my first year.

The second year is where everything began to crumble. I went to university in presence and because of excessive worrying I didn’t manage to make friends and I started to fall behind on lectures. I had 3 friends who each have their own group of friends with whom I didn’t feel comfortable with. I started to spend all my time at home, I dreaded going to university because of the loneliness I felt seeing all of those friend groups already formed and fell even more behind. Of course the more I fell behind the more I became too overwhelmed to fix it. Not to mention that Thea, my nine year old “support” cat, died in the midst of all this from a heart attack.

In March I got a boyfriend who has been extremely helpful with dealing with everything and I’m really grateful for him. I made plans to change with his help but I can’t manage to even start because I have this constant gut feeling that it won’t matter in the long run, that I’m a lost cause and that I’m going to take my own life regardless. I really love this guy, for real, and while sometimes we talk about our future together I can’t be honest and tell him that I don’t see a future for me at all. There are times where I think we should just break up, despite how much I love him, because I don’t want to be a burden he has to bear, and I don’t want to cause him too much pain.

I have been going to therapy for about a year now, but I find it hard to implement the advice I get from my therapist because of my lack of energy and lack of confidence. I lost hope in myself because I don’t ever seem to get better no matter how much I want to change. Something always stops me from actively making a change and I am tired of hearing “it all gets better in the long run” as a response to how shitty I feel.

I have been having persistent crying spells over the last two weeks and have to recover a year worth of university lectures, I have no energy, I feel hopeless, my general lack of appetite is getting worse, and have been having moderate suicidal thoughts. I was wondering whether maybe I should talk to my therapist about getting a diagnosis and start medicating or if I should just wait for this low period to end.

Tl;dr : I’m not diagnosed but feel like I might have depression because of frequent lows, isolation, suicidal thoughts and other symptoms. Wondering if I should talk to my therapist about getting a diagnosis (in order to know what exactly is wrong with me) and start medicating or if I should continue with therapy alone.

i thought i would be fine since it’s usually really short but i think it lasted around 15 to 20 minutes so by the end they finished with the hair stuff and tried talking to me, i couldn’t. i was trying so hard to answer but i couldn’t. 
they were calling my name so many times but i was just there, bot being able to move and talk.

A couple decades ago, I worked for a lady who was nice - treated me with respect and provide much flexibility plus support. Until I showed signs of mental illness (being perpetually tired and slow, because I couldn't sleep and was struggling with intrusive thoughts), and one day she pulled me into her office, poured me a beer, very softly asked if I needed to talk. That was the first time I was shown such kindness, I broke down sobbing and told her everything. She reassured me that she would support me and listen if I ever need to talk about anything.

Guess who I caught talking shit behind my back a few weeks later. Turned out she wasn't happy with my performance and decided that I was using depression as an excuse, in fact I was just lazy and irresponsible. And she didn't discuss my performance with me because that was my responsibility. She also didn't fire me because she believed I'd sue her for discrimination if she did, so alternatively she turned coworkers against me and created a hostile environment hoping I'd get the hint and quit.

I did quit after that. It was the first and last time I believed when someone said I could tell them anything."
depression,"Yesterday was the worst day of my life, but I woke up feeling good, something that has not happened in a while","(24M)
Yesterday on a weed hangover I was crying all day (haven't cried in 9 months), from my failures (weed makes me introspective):

- betraying my fencing team by leaving without saying a word even though I was the 2nd best there (I was teams national champion once) and was needed to help the team get better results.

- (dropping out of college with only one subject left to complete, I had great grades)

- (betraying the first company I worked for where people truly treated me like family and believed in my potential (I was the best programmer there) because one day I smoked too much weed and stopped going to work which caused tremendous backlash and made the company not able to deliver the project in time.

- Hurting myself emotionally by hanging out with my first love and passion for 3 years basically in the friendzone, even living with her and her boyfriend for a while.

- One day I tried to strangle one of the most compassinate friends I have.

After crying so much I became unresponsive, I wouldn't react to anything my parents would say, take a shower! React! I don't understand you!

- I felt this angst in my chest that only got deeper and deeper, I couldn't speak, only cry.

- My brother runs away from whatever division I am in the house, I understand him, watching someone like this, I hope he doesn't become a failure like me.

- My mom is bipolar and started crying uncontrollably, which broke my heart even more.

-----+++++--+--------------------+-+-+-+-+--------+-+-------+-------------

- At night not to be a burden to my family I moved to my grandmas's house i had a deep conversation about the human condition with my uncle and took a sleeping pill which helped immediately, we watched the last shaman, although he feel asleep immediately I felt he was there with me, the movie really touched me. Today I woke up feeling refreshed I just did 20 push ups, I am going out to walk outside a bit an buy a pack but after that I am going to take another sleeping pill and watch the movie again.

I was such a hot shot I don't know what happened to me.
I was supposed to take my family out of poverty, I was the smartest most physicaly and mentally fit of the 3 brothers there, I was gonna help the mentally hill people in my family, some recourses for them to travel and cope with their problems.

I was gonna be their superman. Just started crying, I am gonna wash up and buy those cigarretes and limit social interaction and watch this beautiful movie again.

Thanks for reading this, really, I was never so honest about my feelings in my live I was always proud of not have them, which would make me the most productive software engineer, techlead and programmer, but I need to recognize I have emotions too"

depression,How my diary helped me and why yours should help you too. You are worth being listened to.,"For years I’ve been struggling with mental health especially in middle school. I felt trapped, vulnerable and borderline worthless and I knew these feelings weren’t normal because my peers seemed to have normal responses to certain situations. I was just numb.

I was about 12 and i stumbled upon this book “ Go Ask Alice “. It was a “ diary of a real girl “ who was talking about her struggles with drugs, rape and rape pregnancy at 15 years old and how she killed herself. It affected me deeply when i was a preteen. After reading that i grew up more and more scared of social gatherings, parties, spiked drinks, sex, drugs and human interactions in general. I’ve never done drugs because of that book. It kind of shaped my social life. I was utterly terrified that a normal 15 year old’s life could become so fucked up because of her peers. { for the record, upsettingly the author said that the book was made-up. This confession angered an entire generation because we didn’t want to be like Alice. They scared us but gave us a lesson ). 

I loved that book so much that I started writing my own autobiography/diary. Every event, every traumatic experience, every medical record, every feelings. Detailed, raw and real. 

Ironically I wanted to keep a diary because I wanted to die before 20. I didn’t want to live so I wrote and wrote everything. Mostly because I didn’t have anyone to talk to. My peers didn’t understand me, I couldn’t tell this stuff to my parents nor teachers at that time. ( Kudos to my history teacher who helped me in 12th grade by being my own psychiatrist and talk to me about my depression by getting me out of classes and ask about my mental health ) 

Now I’m 22 and for the last two days I read every page that I found on those diary’s. And I realized one thing. I survived them. I survived all those feelings, bottled up feelings. I didn’t feel suicidal for two years until somethings happened in life that I do not want to discuss about it but then I realized again that I survived those too. The point is, I think everyone should have their own diary’s. Maybe five or ten years from now when you open and read them you will realize just how much shit you lived and you survived. You fought. You won thus resulted you being here right this moment. 

Also I love reading autobiographies so much. Historians, cancer patients, teenager’s, suicide patients. Every kind of autobiography i can find. It really changes your perspective in life.

Do I still struggle with mental health issues? Yes, on the daily. Major ones. Major enough to fuck up my love life, education life and even personal life. But am I affected by them as I used to be? Definitely not. My diary’s helped me, your story should be written too."
depression,I deserve everything I got what I went through today.,"I deserved it, when I was 10 years old, I trapped a cat inside a plastic and slam it on the ground until it becomes unconscious, I threw it far away from bush. I thought it was funny, I was living on the time my parents were still arguing about anything, my dad was drunk. Both of them would argue and break something. I was living in that kind of environment. But that does not excuse the fact that I intentionally fucking drowned a cat for fun. But it didn't died, because my dad saved the cat. I still got nightmares about that cat.

I also bully innocent kid for fun when I was a kid, up till 2017 when I was getting into high school everyone bullies me. I suffer from it for 5 years. I feel like I deserve it."

The only reason why I even acknowledge the fact that I need help to begin with is because of how much it’s interfered with my life - including school and grades. So… yea I guess."

depression,Is High Functioning Depression a thing?,"I'm doing a course at the moment in mental health awareness and the one topic I am doing right now is depression. It talks a lot about clinical depression where low mood lasts 2+ weeks and severely impacts your daily life and I for sure have experienced depression like that in the past. But, lately, I've realised my life has improved- before I couldn't work and lost my job because of it, I barely made it into university once every couple of weeks, I ate my emotions, and I was hardcore into drugs to get me through the day, and hurt myself regularly. 

Nowadays, I'm functioning okay. I get up and I go to work, I study and I've been doing way better studying for my degree this time around, as my last time was a disaster. I've lost weight, I exercise and I eat better, but still have issues with it. All in all, as an outsider, you'd say things were going pretty well. I have friends, a supportive family, I have my own place (kinda) and I have money to get by. Yet, I'm not really happy, I'd say I never really have had my depressive feelings go away. They've improved, for sure, but they're still there. I still feel very pessimistic and people call me cynical. I don't hold out much hope for the future and I feel like I'm just getting by. Some days are harder than others, and I still struggle maintaining hygiene and doing basic tasks sometimes, but I still survive. It just feels like that's all I am doing... surviving. I don't find joy in too many things, except my studies, which is probably why I'm doing so well, but even then I worry I will lose interest one day like I have done with so many other things.

Is this a sign of high functioning depression? I read something about persistent depressive disorder, and I seem to fit that to a T. I'm managing, but it feels though the darkness is pulling me in, sometimes, and I am fighting it all the while. I remember having very dark and severe suicidal thoughts in the past and they rarely crop up now, but I do tend to have a suicidal ideation where my dreams constantly have themes of me offing myself or dying, and they happen in my daily life too. I'm pretty cool with them because I don't feel the urge to act on them but I'm aware it's not 'normal behaviour'. I just wonder if it will ever go away. I've not been the same since I was 16, that's 10 years with my head in a dark cloud."
depression,I wish I never existed,"I’m tired of living in this world. I’ve literally never experienced happiness. I’ve suffered mental health issues since I was in middle school and I’m 23 now. I have severe anxiety  and it’s hard for me to socialize, so I    
Isolate myself from friends and family. I’m never invited to do stuff with friends but I understand because I distance myself and never wanna tag along when offered. My family has been calling me weird for years because I isolate myself and I’m antisocial but they don’t understand that I’m not a social person. I can be In room filled with people and I always seem alone. I just wish I was never alive the day to day struggle gets worse and worse. I go to sleep at like 7am every night because negative thought run through my mind constantly. I just want the pain to end."

I feel like I’m lying to them even though I fully believe those lies myself. I’m so sick of wasting a week after week not doing anything. I’m sick of letting my chances of passing uni drop every week. Is there a way to break out of the cycle?

depression,I feel like my hopes and dreams are slipping away,"My dream was always to become a professional tennis player. Ever since I was a kid, I've trained so much to achieve this goal. In 2019, I even gave up my childhood friends to move away so I can train better. Lately, however, it hasn't been going well. I am soon to enter my senior year of high school, and the likelihood of me achieving this lifelong dream is dwindling. My mother has forced me to cut back on my training due to my studies. I've been told that after I am ahead of everyone and doing well in my studies, then I can get back to training as I want to. However, even with more time on my hands, my studies haven't gotten any better. I see my competitors post about their achievements and winnings online and how some have even already committed to a college. I feel like everyone else is just continuing without me, living the dream that I've always dreamed of"

depression,Help finding a way out of emotional support desert,"I'm a 35m closeted atheist, which is wrecking havoc on my life. No one knows except two friends. But leaving religion created a barrier between me and most people that I know. So I can't talk to my family or friends about my problems. I have no support. Almost no one to turn to when I need emotional support. Even worse, people are trying to help me with all the wrong pieces of advice. Like motivating me to turn more to faith or invite me to prayer sessions or proposing arranged marriage. And the more I feel not understood, not supported, the more I plunge into depression. I'm trying to fill this void by looking for a girlfriend but I don't think it's fair to her to handle all this emotional baggage. And my therapist thinks that I'm trying to fill the void with a relationship which is not healthy. So what am I supposed to do? My entourage is very religious and I'll face huge backlash if I come out. I feel suffocated. Any advice is welcome."

depression,"Hey, anyone free to talk?","We don't really need to talk about anything in particular. I just well, it's 2:12am and I've hit a bit of a rock bottom. Just anything is fine, anything at all :)"
depression,"Help, please.","Do I need professional help?

Two years ago, I was talking with my closest-and only- friends. Out of nowhere, a major political event occurred over the media, and my friends became visibly upset over it. I disagreed with them, and offered my own perspective on the issue. Heat was exchanged, and I called my best friend a coward. They all turned on me and essentially told me to fuck off. So I did.
I took my political perspective to social media, and everyone disagreed with me. They debated me, and refused to listen to what I was saying. They called me crazy, ignorant, and even evil. I received texts from my ex-best friends about how much they ‘hated my guts’. 
In one day, I lost every single friend and acquaintance I had. They all loathe me, for reasons that are unjustified. 

Every time I see them, 7/10 times I have a panic attack. If not, I become angry, guilty, hopeless and detached. I dream about it almost every night, and when I talk to myself I pretend that I’m talking to them, either to debate or to pretend that the argument never happened, and that we were still good friends.

I cannot handle the fact that these people run the world. These people who lie to their people and manipulate them into believing that they are the ‘good guys’. It DESTROYS me.

I am on the highest possible dosage of my antidepressant. I am desperate.

Please help."
depression,Having people depend on me...,"Depression is something I battle nearly everyday, the only thing that keeps me from going over the edge is my family and brother/dog that depend on me. It's gotten me this far but I fear one day it won't be enough. Just came here to see if anyone has a similar situation? Is it something that I can hold onto to keep me from being too overwhelmed with my feelings of self hate? I wouldn't want them to be negatively affected by a selfish decision of mine.... 
Maybe my next step is therapy but I'm worried about bad experiences I've heard from others"
depression,I just dont have anymore hope,"I just don't believe there is anything that is worth living for. Like, what's the point of putting effort into things you don't like or want to do when the outcome is also undesirable or blurry at best. Like, a hyperbolic example would be like your boss asking you to work the weekend but they wont pay you for it. You obviously wouldn't just work for nothing on your day off, but you might if they offered you a million dollars. I think the same applies for any action a person might do; that the degree of motivation dictates our endeavors, whether those motivators are personal or external. I don't believe I have any motivation to do anything other than the bare minimum required to survive an be comfortable, yet I still desire things like a relationship, wealth, or property. I just don't believe that my desires are achievable and therefore have no motivation to chase them. Like, I'm sure we all want more money and might be willing to work extra to make it, but like in my example, you wouldn't put in extra work if you were told you wouldn't get paid for it. I'm not even sure why I lost hope to begin with, but I doubt that I can get it back simply by thinking harder or by listening to the words of strangers. There is literally nothing about me worth fighting for and I genuinely don't want to live to see how bad the future will become."

depression,I'm too young for this thing called depression.,"So I'm 16 years old and I think I've had depression for atleast over a year but I don't want to go see someone about it because I don't want my parents and other family to worry about me right now.

My dad has recently been putting pressure on me to get an apprenticeship(An apprenticeship is like a job and school combined, you train for a number of years for it) for panel beating (which is repairing dents in transport) and it's been pushing me further into darkness and I haven't a clue what I want to do after I leave school rather it be this year or next. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be 25 with no job still living with my parents.

Before this I went through a faze where I would barely talk to any of my friends at and after school. They put the pieces of the puzzle together, and they would all tell me that life would get better and that that'd hope I feel better. They try force me to go to the school counselor which I don't want because they notfiy my parents about it and then I'll put pressure on them when they work their asses off for me and I feel so ungrateful because I show barely any emotions anymore. Even before that faze I was bullied because I was the ""pussy"" and the ""waste of oxygen"" at school and alot of people hated and still hate me.

5 or so years ago I was such a cheerful young boy that would get along with everything and everything I would draw cool little pictures and give them to my friends and family, but now I don't have any energy to do anything anymore. All I do is go to school, sleep in most of my classes, come home and lie in my bed and scroll through some social media till I cry myself to sleep which would be around 11 then wake up the next day at 7 and go to school. 

I feel so empty inside all the time and just of late I somehow got a crush on this really nice and cool girl at school, so I plucked up the courage to ask her out but she sadly rejected me.

I want to end it all right now, I feel like theirs nothing and nobody in this world for me even though so many people care about me. And I honestly don't want them to care so much because theres nothing special about me at all.

I congratulate you if you've read all this thank you for your time. Please older people please tell me it will get better"
depression,How do I help someone with a different kind of depression?,"People react differently to stress. Me? (F21) Im the sensitive empath. I cry a lot, I don’t want to go out, I isolate myself, I feel like I’m an inconvenience &amp; no one loves me like I love them. My friend? (M26) Is the angry asshole. He gets so mad at himself, is annoyed with everyone, ignores all his problems &amp; possible solutions. I love him &amp; care about him very much &amp; at our core, we have the same feelings, we just express them differently. I’m dealing with my own issues but I am always willing to help other bc I don’t wish this on anyone. Making others feel better makes me feel better. It’s a win-win. However, all of us in this subreddit know that people that don’t help themselves &amp; don’t want to be helped, cannot be helped. So obv, nothing I do will help unless he lets it &amp; ofc, he’s not. He basically hates everything right now. He wants to call me but he doesn’t want me to talk bc he gets frustrated bc he’s in the “nothing matters” mindset &amp; he doesn’t have anything to say &amp; he also doesn’t want to hang around anyone. I can’t say anything without getting cut off with a snappy response. I am very patient but I also need to have respect for myself &amp; I need to be respected by others. I tend to let people walk all over me bc im too caring &amp; empathetic. How do I set boundaries in this situation but still let him know that I am always willing to help if he allows me to? He’s very hot &amp; cold with this bc he’s fine when he’s calm but as soon as he’s overwhelmed he gets extremely irritable/rude. I can’t allow that but I also understand. Any advice? :/"

i almost constantly get this weird uncomfortable feeling. it’s like my brains telling me nothings right around me. things that i always knew as a certainty like my love for my girlfriend and my life goals are constantly being questioned in my mind (when deep down i know they’re true). 

it’s really hard to explain but i never feel comfortable in my skin i constantly feel intrusive thoughts and a general desire to not want to exist. it’s not really a typical depressed or anxious feeling as i’m used to, more a weird and uncomfortable feeling of despair and confusion. it makes me not want to exist anymore because it’s so uncomfortable and confuses me so much on if what i’m thinking is right or not and why i feel so freaked out by things once normal to me.

please if you have any advice lmk, i’m getting desperate because i hate this feeling so much, feel like i’m going crazy"

I then stopped getting the monthly phone calls out of nowhere (seemingly unrelated to my 18th birthday) and then randomly got a call from a doctor at camhs (not the adult services) (not a therapist) who said she was putting me on medication. Ok, fine. I still didn't get any check in calls. I got one to see how the medication was doing and refill my prescription when it was running out. The other day I got my first call from them in a couple months. It was the doctor telling me I'm being discharged from their services. After the other woman told me they had accepted me. I've been sat here waiting for and expecting (only given what I was told by them) therapy sessions.

Looking back on the last decade, I think the biggest theme has been loss of hope. I had one girlfriend in the last decade. And I do miss her. I miss having someone to talk and laugh with. Someone who smiled at me like I was special and important. I miss driving from my university to hers on Fridays and spending time with her before taking her back home for the weekend. I miss intimacy. I miss her family. I miss her house. I miss going to restaurants and taking vacations with them.

But I think what I miss the most is feeling hope. I used to believe, even at my darkest moments, that things could get better. Depression is what ended the relationship, and in the 6 years since then, I've stopped believing things can be better. And now I am entrenched in a rut so deep that I don't see how to crawl my way out.

It was like having a few years where I got to experience what it's like to be a real person, and now I'm just a husk."
depression,"Anhedonia is so tiring, like not only I feel like crap, I also can’t distract myself with some fun","I used to have a lot of hobbies and all, I was interested in drawing, 3d art, video games and all. All my hobbies except gaming kind off stopped giving me any pleasure and they just started feeling like chores. For more than year video games were the only thing that I was enjoying, but that just also passed. 

I just feel awful and all I do is wait for the day to end. Like the most enjoyable thing for me is literally lying in bed with my cats, but it isn’t enough to make me feel at least happy for the moment."
depression,I’m trying to reconcile with the people who I trusted.,"How do I go about it. I don’t like the idea of court and all of that. But I can’t live life as normal. I would literally feel good if they would just take me serious, I’m not going to backstab them. I hurt everyday. These people can just talk to me, be honest, there’s nobody except me. I don’t want this to be case. Please, let me join you. I already know how it works man/woman, I can replicate and show you guys I’m not a piece of shit. I was just in a very bad depression."
depression,Tips for dealing with depression at university,"After two years, I finally admitted to myself that I needed help. I had my first doctor's appointment today and was given Citalopram. Hopefully things will finally start to look up!

But to others here: Do you guys have any tips for me in college? Two years of letting everything slide in my masters has caused a lot of problems. So it is difficult to take the exam because the module is not offered this semester. In addition, how do I explain to the research group where I want to write my master's thesis why it took me two years longer to complete my previous studies? Somehow it is still hard for me to tell others about it."

depression,I feel like a huge letdown to myself and my family.,"I dropped out of University twice, I have no real friends and I am still living with my Dad at age 20. I am hopefully starting a job at McDonalds soon and I feel like the most pathetic man alive. Nothing I try to do feels worth it anymore and I just wish it will all end soon."
depression,Why am I like this,"I feel like I should be enjoying my 20s, dating, partying, etc. but I’m constantly working, very small social circle, etc. A few days ago my friend asked why I never see anyone and that kinda broke my heart. I don’t know why…"
depression,my severe loneliness makes me fall for anyone,"I know I'm young, I'm 15, but I've never even held someone's hand romantically or ever even made intimate eye contact. All of my other friends have been in relationships before, had their first kiss, etc... but I'm genuinely so unlikeable. After being treated like shit for most of my life I fall hard for who treats me somewhat decently. It hurts how much I like him, he'll never like me like that. It hurts so much but all I can do is admire him from a far. He doesn't even know my name. I've had many crushes on teachers and tutors before and these feelings are the reason I'm scared to get a tutor again. Idk man fuck life I'm over it"
depression,So sad that I can’t cry,"To relieve stress I cry and have full mental breakdowns but I can’t cry. I’ve been holding in my sadness and anger on many different things and I feel like there’s something in my throat that wants me to say something but I can’t get it out. I can’t even pin point why I’m sad, and why I feel this way. I just want to cry"
depression,Seeking solace in nostalgia and its comforting certainty,"The future could be anything and so it's easier to drift back into the forged archives of the past. Like re-watching a movie that we learn the words to we revel in the certainty and familiarity. Hand-picking moments that gave us the most joy to revisit.

But the joy is short lived and the price we pay can be deep. Frustration that these moments can not be replicated. That you are walking through the past on your own. That in your reminiscent world the people exist only as they did then. You cling to a past which your present self can form no new connection with.

Is the past something we think about more when the present or future feel bleak? Is it the brains way of attempting to reconnect to something positive, to save us from depression? But in that attempt sometimes making us feel more low?  don't want to keep going back there, I'd like to enjoy new moments as they happen. 

""To live in the moment"". A cliche but a strong sentiment. I think it's something I only ever done when I was young. When work or finances or relationships were less important. I would love to get back to that place."

depression,Why isn’t it getting better,"I find solutions to my problems and I try to change my thought patterns but all of the negative thoughts keep rushing back in. Whenever I think positively I feel like I’m lying to myself. I’ve skipped school for over a week now, I lie in bed all day. All of my friends have finished their exams but I’ve still got three exams piled up. My friends all work harder than me but for some reason I still feel so tired. I just want a break even though I can’t get myself to do as much as what my friends do. I‘m constantly doing mental gymnastics trying to keep myself here, I wish that counted as hard work to other people because it surely does feel like it. I can’t tell if I’m putting just as much effort into living as other people (or even more effort) or if I’m just weak and lazy. I hate how my friends are dealing with climbing big mountains like applying for jobs yet my big mountains are doing one thing a day and eating/drinking water. I feel so inferior compared to them and I feel so stuck. Why aren’t I getting better? Why can’t I be where they’re standing right now?"

depression,I feel like a token for people to say they are inclusive.,"This is my first time ever posting anything on reddit besides comments, so I'm sorry if this is like really bad or stupid or something. I have a personality disorder and it sucks because I have to fight with myself everyday just to act and feel normal and sometimes I can't do it. I can't always fight off these thoughts and changes that can happen on a dime making me do bad things. Thankfully it's been nothing too bad but I feel as though my friends are slipping away from me unable to actually deal with me and when I vent my frustrations or these intrusive thoughts in my head I get silenced or ignored. It makes this dark depressed feeling inside eat away at me slowly. As of recent I have been accused of doing something absolutely atrocious and I can't say anything to prove it otherwise since I'm the crazy guy so all of my friends just abandoned me and called me said disgusting thing even though it's not true. I hate that I'm just a sign for them to say they are inclusive to people with mental problems too. They can't bear my issues and throw me away and make people who don't know me and people who do hate me with false claims when I become too much to handle and I'm sick of it. I'm a good person fighting to be normal and I'm doing a great job climbing up, it's just not fair."
depression,A dream about being at work,[removed]
depression,Suddenly thinking about disappearing from my family for 10 years,"I love my parents and my older sister, but I get depressed whenever I think about my life with them in the future. I’m talking about how I have to help pay for their debt while trying to maintain a successful career and save money. Not to mention they will expect me to buy a house for them and take care of them. I can’t even take care of myself. I hate responsibilities. 

I suddenly want to block them. I don’t care if I end up dying somewhere, but I just want to run away for some peace of mind for maybe 5 to 10 years. My parents call me every single day to ask how I perform at work and to remind me to check my bank balance so that I’m on track with “my” goal. This has stressed me out so much and I wish they could just stop calling me. Mom and dad, I don’t give a penny about marriage, car or house. Stop telling me what to so."
depression,How do many people get through their days despite a lack of meaning?,"Right now, I'm OK, but I had a rather little depressive episode just recently. And this made me think about a think once again: How do many (maybe even most?) people just do all the stuff we have to do without becoming nuts? Don't most people (at least in less religious countries) also think that there either is no such thing as a meaning of life? If so, then how do people find so much motivation to do stuff and not get depressed? 

I wasn't (or at least only occasionally) depressed for about 2 years now, but I think that only worked because of an effective strategy for escapism which currently doesn't work no more.

I heard about all this absurdist or existentialist ""you have to give your life a meaning"" but that's exactly what doesn't work anymore because I had to cheat myself for it to work."
depression,Back to Square 1,"I’ve been taking antidepressants for about 8 months now, a few months in my psychiatrist doubled my prescription. It’s been fine for the past few months but, every time i spiral back, it somehow feels worse and heavier than before. I take them every night and yet here I find myself wondering what I did wrong in my routine to slowly sink back in this hole. None of my friends know this side of me, and I’d much rather prefer to keep it that way. I’m turning 16 soon, yet I still have this empty feeling inside of me. This unwanted guest that’s always roaming around in my mind and this useless force that continues to weigh down my chest. I just needed to put this out there, and i’m sorry."

depression,"Another day, yet again...","Don't believe it'll become better.

I've suffered from depression on &amp; off and was drawed toward death since I was 8yo.

I'm 34 now; with a house (on credit), a wife, and my three cornsnakes. Unable to work atm, due to back problems (&amp; the depression, obviously).

Shit's still the same.

  
The only place I was feeling that I could fit in, was being among the Theravada buddhists monks in a Burmese jungle monastery, but it's a lot of sacrifices staying over there (No PC, No music, No videos, No money, Nor drinks or drugs,...)

I came back from there persuading myself it was to take care of my grand-parents; when I was dreaming of cheeseburgers and videogames.

Time passed, I worked, got my snakes, met my wife, bought the house, then health issue, lost job, lost back, grandpa died.

All I do now is watching youtube, vaping weed, prepare dinner for mylady when she get back from work, and go to that ""spine school"" twice a week for training my back. Oh and care about my grandma.   
I'm supposed to find a new job after the back training, don't really know what to do, I've been jobless for more than a year now. Thinking about dubbing actor; without putting much energy or faith in it, having no connexions nor experience yet in that domain.  


Will then only remains my wife and my snakes as last attachments...

I don't know where I'm going or how long it will last.

Maybe I'll get by another day to tell you all how it went.   
I'll probably watch events around me and do nothing as usual.

**TLD/DR:** **This is going nowhere, no question or nothing, I just wanted to vent I guess.**  


Take care you all. Your life are all precious, nevermind how worthless you feel."

She was quite tall and rlly grown up for her age as well I thought she was like 18 at first. One day she asked if she could kiss me on the lips (just a quick peck) and I let her do it because I was too nice to say no. The same thing happened a few more times and now I feel terrible about it to the point I wanna kill myself. I feel so creepy and weird even though I had no feelings for her whatsoever I still feel terrible. Also I've been kicked out of my friend group because of it"

depression,An interesting title.,"I'm 27 and I've been depressed for half of my life (probably have bipolar depression, but not a fan of diagnosing myself and haven't been to a doctor in a long time). It's hard to explain what it's like now. I ""function"", I work and clean my house and take care of my dog, I talk to friends (who I am happy to have), I read books when I get moments of lucidity. But in between all of this - or rather, pervading all of this - all I think about is dying. I try to listen to music to trigger some sort of emotional response; I try to reread books so they aren't as hard as new books, but maybe I can get pleasure from something I know I once enjoyed; I try to play with my dog, and cook for my chickens, and do things to make other animals happy so that maybe that will make me happy. I don't get happy. Now I shoot for satisfaction, for being content. I rarely get these either now. I wish I was a low energy depressive, I wish I didn't have animals; I could just sleep all day. But I can't, I'm never really tired anymore. I would rather destroy a wall or piece of furniture than fall into a coma. But I never do. I'm not violent, I don't cut myself anymore (mostly because I want more tattoos lol), and I don't tell others - even those that care about me - how fucking terrible just waking up is. But deep down I just want to cut my entire body up, or destroy some dumbass ape I see way too much in society, or just fucking scream as loud as I can. But I can't even scream because that would make my dog stressed. I just sit here dying, trying not to become an alcoholic, trying not to worry about my low stash of weed - the only thing triggers positive emotions. Trying, trying, trying - literally always fucking TRYING. Everything is uphill. I wonder what it's like to just wake up happy, must be goddamn crazy. I also wish I could cry. I had to take my mom's cat (who used to be my cat) to get euthanized yesterday, and I loved him but I didn't cry. And just going to the animal hospital felt like one big joke: quotes on walls, beach ASMR, emergency buttons - things for humans and human comfort. I just wanted him to be dead and buried, so it could be over like every other pointless thing. And that's the thing - everything is pointless, even life and death. But we are just another animal, and we are literally programmed to make the pointless seem fulfilling, to mean something. My body doesn't even have the fuel to keep up with that programming though. Everything feels the same, and it's all terrible."
depression,just needed somewhere to dump this (tw just in case),"i don't deserve the few friends i have. i have done nothing to warrant anyone being nice to me at all, let alone anything to warrant having some really amazing people look out for me. someone who used to be my lifeline doesn't want to remember that i exist. i am pulling them all down and making them miserable. suicide would objectively be acting in the interest of the people i love. their lives would all be happier and easier if i was dead. my parents wouldn't have to pay for meds and therapists and doctors and fight with teachers and listen to my bullshit on top of it all. my friends shouldn't have to keep dealing with me accidentally treating them like therapists and checking on me to make sure i make it to school the next day. if i actually cared about the people i loved and wasn't such a fucking coward than i would've killed myself a long time ago."

depression,300mg/day Amitriptyline (Redomex),"I've had over 20 medications to help make life more bearable but none of them ever worked. Took a break from meds for two years (with doctors help in decreasing meds). I was okay for 1,5 years but then fell into the pit that is depression. So now I'm back to trying out medication. I'm tired. Nothing seems to work. I'm now on Amitriptyline, 150 in the morning and 150 before bed. The only change I noticed was that I lost motivation and energy and I've gained a few pounds because I can't seem to feel full after eating anymore. I'm still as depressed as I've always been and I wonder if maybe this medication doesn't work either. I'm on week 6, so it's still early but I figured I should've been feeling some relief, right? It's so tiring to always have to wait and see if you feel better. The years are passing by and I still don't want to live. When does it ever get better? It's like I just don't react well to medication. I rarely even get side effects. I just want to feel better. I don't need to be rich or pretty, I just want to feel happyish or I'd settle for just okay. I'm so tired.."
depression,"I don't feel like fighting my depression anymore, it's getting too hard","To clarify, I don't want to actively harm myself, I just don't want to keep trying to get better. I've been severely depressed since I was 15 and I'm 23 now, I've been in and out of mental facilities, tried several rounds of medications (that always needed mood stabilizers or some other medications to balance them out as I have other mental illness), I've practiced self love and trying to overall be positive..it just doesn't seem like anything I have ever done made an effect, if anything I just feel stupid for thinking I would be able to get out of this hole. Obviously not every day is a bad day, there are a lot of good days but it's just..hard..especially lately. I have a severe social anxiety, I freeze up and don't know how to talk to people, I want friends so badly it's a problem but I never seem to succeed in making a friendship that lasts, or that doesn't turn around and bite me in the ass. There's also been a lot of changes since last Novemeber in my life that have just really..set in stone that I don't want to try. I quit my job that was making me miserable only to end up in so much debt I can't breathe most days, I don't have health insurance so I can't afford my mental health treatments or therapy, I broke up with my partner who I was with for 2.5 years because we just were not compatible and i was causing a lot of damage with how mentally ill i was and it wasnt fair to him to subject him to that because I was not able to be the partner they deserved..and I may be homeless by August because I cannot save money by the time our lease ends because I am trying to get out of the 15k+ of debt I owe. It feels never ending. I just want to stop trying. I have no reason to keep it up. I really think I'm meant to be sad, lonely, miserable, and lost my whole life. I've always been the person to love and give love, but in the same token I don't think I was meant to be loved or even understood past a certain point. I'm just a waste, I'm pathetic, and I probably deserve to be this way. I'm sorry rambling..I just have nobody to talk to that understands how I could possibly feel this way. I don't want to kill myself, but if something were to happen to me, I think it would be a blessing."
depression,I lost my friends a month ago and I'm not going to make new ones ever.,"I have always hated the term ""cut ties"" and this would later make sense when I realized I have a fear of abandonment. My friends cut ties with me on March 1st and another friend 2 weeks later over things I couldn't control. It has put me into an extremely depressive state which has ruined my grades and my relationship with my father. I was always open to them about how scared I was to lose them yet they still did it anyways. I understand that they don't want to be my friend anymore and I'm not going to pursue a friendship with them anymore but to protect myself I'm going to try my hardest to not become close to anyone ever again. If I ever want to play games with someone I'll find randoms online. If I ever need to vent to someone I'll go to a helpline. Everyone I've talked to says I'll make new friends but I don't want new friends because it will just hurt all over again if they abandon me too. The other person they cut off doesn't seem to be bothered that much either and I just don't understand why. People may say this is a sad way of living or it is self destructive but this is how I'll protect myself from now on."

depression,I don’t know what to do with myself and my life," I’m just stuck…I have nothing to look forward too. I have a beautiful girlfriend who I’ve been with for almost 6 years now, but about a year ago I found out she fucked her boss and her bosses boyfriend. I knew for awhile but couldn’t prove it. I even started cutting myself because I couldn’t deal with it and it didn’t bother her at all. She just kept cheating on me until I found proof. Worst part is I don’t even mind doing stuff with people who aren’t just me and her, I’m very open sexually. But I’m not good enough to be involved! Nobody invites the socially awkward boyfriend of the hot girl hahaha

Afterwards I tried to be accommodating and had us both be more open sexually, but that just led to her talking to several other guys behind my back, talking to them like they were her soul mates, telling them things she’s never told me. It’s like, damn, why do all this? You give somebody as much space to figure out what they want as you can, and  they still keep things from you. I don’t even care that she liked other people really….it’s all the hiding and the intimacy. Our entire relationship she acted like I was the only person who she could ever be attracted to, acted suspicious anytime I’d talk to another girl, removed the girls from my phone that weren’t her…..it’s a bit much but I thought that’s just what happens when somebody loves you a lot. But it’s all projection I guess.

Now here we are over a year later. We have a lot of good times. I love her and love everything we do. But there is ALWAYS a voice in my head telling me what a joke I am and how she’ll cheat on me again as soon as she gets the chance. I have no confidence in myself. I feel dumb even having sex because it’s like, she’s actually done all her fantasies and I’m just the guy who wishes I could have been there with her. I wouldn’t even think of trying to explore my own fantasies, I feel ridiculous.  I’m a nervous man who would need her to guide me through them and make me comfortable, but she has no need for me to explore herself.

I don’t know what the point of this is even…..just don’t know what to do. We live together. Neither of us could afford our own place. I wouldn’t want to live without her anyways. I left home for an hour last night and it’s like my soul was crushed. Nothing mattered to me. When I’m with her, all I see is how she hurt me. When im not with her I feel like a shell of a person. It’s just too much….I wish I didn’t have parents who cared because I’d rather just blow my brains out then deal with all of this. I hate that people would mourn me. Ugh.

I cry every night, I find it therapeutic but sometimes the emotions are so strong, I don't know what to do. I can't even get a proper sleep thinking about my future, I studied really hard when I was in college, had part time jobs, but I realized, that I'm not even good at anything I'm doing. I kept thinking that everything would be fine. Everything will pass, but here I am still stuck in a dark void. I just wished it will all be over soon. My mind is killing me."
depression,Thinking about disappearing and leaving everyone alone,"I've entertained the idea of disappearing for awhile. Probably the first time was when I was about 8, and it's been pretty steady throughout the years. I think that I might finally be at a place where the pros would outweigh the cons. I don't provide any value to the people in my life, and all I do is cause issues. I exert all of my energy into being a people pleaser, a fixer, a problem solver, all in a desperate attempt to make people happy and to feel wanted. But it's never successful. I'm either ignored (I can flat out be talking to my mom and she won't hear a word of what I said) or told that I'm wrong. I'm always wrong. Nothing is ever right, nothing is ever good enough. And I am not a whole person as I am. I am a shell. I am nothing. I have no redeeming qualities, I have no complete friendships or relationships, and I pretty much just exist. As it is, my mom only talks to me to vent about her life, my friends only really talk to me to complain, and I am not adequate enough to have a boyfriend who wants all of me.

I think that if I just left my life, it would take days or weeks before anyone even noticed. Once they noticed, they'd realize that it makes no difference, or if anything, they'd realize that their life has improved. I view it as the ultimate act of love for those in my life, showing that I care enough about them to no longer bother them anymore.

The problem is that I'm a huge anxious baby. The thought of leaving my apartment and going off to some other place and starting over makes me really scared. I know that there's no going back once I go. I have to be completely dedicated because there's no way that I could turn back once people realized how good it is to not have me around. I have to have all of my ducks in a row before I go.

depression,I need help..,"Lately I’ve been depressed because am alone with no friends. However my family when they talk to me I always reply rude things to them push them away and I hate it.

I want to practice being cold and not to talk too much. Can someone please tell me how? Cause i hate hurting my family feelings I don’t want to reply rude things to them. I want to stay clam and cold all the time am with them."
depression,Blood.,"God, why it is so hard to cut yourself to your bones. To see your blood dropping down. I hate myself. I am a disgrace to everybody else. Everybody hates me in the end. I deserve death."
depression,I consider myself a decent person. No-one will ever love me however.,"I live a dull life with little social interaction because I suck at it. I lift a lot and have built a decent physique that I'm proud of. I work almost full time while studying full time at university. I've saved up more in my bank through stock investment than most people my age(21). Despite this I am painfully socially incompetent. I'm unable to get close or open up with most people because of my awkwardness. My days are painfully dull and stressful, but I keep doing it because I do what produces the most money and long term success. I still come home depressed everyday and drink myself a beer or two to dull my emotions. I try to always be a good person, I buy my loved one gifts, I help friends when needed, I follow a strict moral code, I try to be open minded. But none of these matter because I suck at being cool. I can be the richest nicest man, but no woman will ever like me because I'm a disappointment socially. But I keep living, and fuck I hate it."
depression,Should I adopt a puppy when I'm depressed?,"I'm 20 F, and I live with my extremely toxic parents, hoping to move out soon. I have a cat and I still haven't decided whether I'm gonna live or impulsively kill myself. I've been wanting to get a dog since a year and I tried fostering a dog last year but that did not sit well with my cat (the dog would actively growl and bark at her, wasn't used to cats) . It was also very stressful for me because he wasn't used to eating dog food either so I had to make his food fresh everyday. He was aggressive and as someone with zero experience with dogs I had no idea how to handle him. By the time I got a dog trainer I was so exhausted that I'd started self harming and hence decided to let the him go which in itself was an extremely heartbreaking task. Everything suggests I shouldnt get a puppy rn. Maybe it's just an impulsive thing and I won't be able to cope with it. The idea makes me sick to my stomach.

I've been in intensive therapy since and was generally doing alot better but recently had an epic fight with my parents hence things aren't looking so good rn. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I'm hoping somebody here will understand what I'm talking about and perhaps have had a positive experience that I can look up to, which might be selfish of me. I don't want to get a puppy because I expect it to fix me and then not be able to take care of it but at the same time I'm sick of being a loveless shell of person. I'd appreciate any insight or advice you may have."

depression,A quick question for you all,[removed]
depression,I have nothing going for me and no reason to stay,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for almost 7 years now..i turn 20 this week and I came to the realisation today that i have no purpose or reasons to stay or anything to keep me going, I’m not close with my family, i never was my parents were never affectionate, i ended up detaching myself from my high school friends last year and the only person im close with is my girlfriend, university is killing me, i chose this degree because i didnt know what else to do and its no passion of mine and neither will my future career be. My girlfriend makes me so happy and i adore being with her more than anything shes the only person that has ever made me feel so loved, safe and comfortable, something that not even my own family was capable of doing and yet whenever we talk about the near future she has so many dreams and aspirations, she wants to travel the world and get her dream job, she has a life outside of our relationship, she has friends meanwhile the only thing i look forward to in the near future is moving in with her (since we study in different countries) it made me realise that she and this relationship are my only source of genuine happiness and if we were to ever break up then what would i have? Nothing and this just made me feel really miserable because time is going by so slowly these days and i still have around 2 years left of university which i despise and i dont know if i will make it until then, i referred myself to therapy via my university and they put me on a waiting list so i cant even get help or advice or anything regarding this stuff and it just sucks im really just exhausted and havent had the motivation to even try for years i dont know what im living for and i feel very pathetic because of it."
depression,Lately it feels like there's no meaning to anything,"I've always been a depressed, fearfull and anxious person. Never had any goals, except to survive till the next day. Spent almost all my time on this planet watching my own life passing me by. Always full of regrets because I have not done things I wanted to because I was too afraid. Being scared to experience things only to then be haunted by the lack of all those experiences others had except me. 
Now I am an adult but I do not feel like one. At times, I don't even feel like I am here. Or that I should be. 
As a teenager I would develop some hobbies, such as drawing, painting, scrapbooking, I even tried learning to play keyboard. Though eventually I'd lose my interest in any of those things. Lack of discipline or drive was always an issue. I gave up because I'd always reach a point where I'd start thinking that there is no point ofnme trying to do all those things because I could never be good enough. 
I don't believe in myself or that I have any value. 
I graduated from university studying the only thing I was ever truly good at - English language. Didn't study it because if was my own choice, I was forced by my parents. I wanted to be a dietician, but since I was never good at chemistry or biology, and never was brave enough to stand up for myself and fight for what I think is right, I just went with it. Ended up doing what was expected of me. Can't say I didn't have any good experiences following that path, but it was never truly my own. I believe I am pathetic. I really hate myself and I don't know what to do with my life. I used to love music and listen to lots of it every day. Now I don't even care. A few months ago I developed a passion for cooking. Not in a professional way, completely as an amateur since I only started cooking when I entered my twenties. People who tried my cooking said it was really good. I thought the same thing. Of course I didn't immidiately think I'm some next Gordon Ramsay, but it just gave me joy and I thought I was relatively good. It was this kind of thing I wanted to do regardless of how tired I was. Now, even that doesn't seem appealing. At all.
Nothing gives me joy anymore. I feel so numb and useless. I don't know what my purpose in life is. 
I want to find a job abroad, somewhere in Europe to start my life with a clean slate, maybe that would help? I truly don't know and need help because I know staying where I am will do no good."
depression,So I never thought I would be posting on here.,"(21m) I never thought It would come to the point where I would be posting on a depression subreddit. Honestly, I never thought I would be depressed at all. I’ve had family members pass away and I was sad for a while but life moved on. I had my oldest brother pass away when I was 13 (he was 19). Even then, I never felt depressed. Just extremely sad. 

It wasn’t until I took dating seriously and had my heart absolutley torn apart. It was something I had never experienced before. Two years gone like that. I started working out and I’m never satisfied with how I look. I’m 6’2 and 150lbs. I try to convince myself things will be fine but sometimes my head gets to me. I’m still going through the breakup so everything is hard. It happened three months ago, and I am finding it hard to move forward. 

I’ll be fine for a couple days, then it’s days of constant sadness and not really wanting to be here. It comes and goes in waves, but those waves hit hard. 

Not really sure what to do anymore."
depression,Depression fighting tips anyone?,"Hey all

I have un-diagnosed depression since high school (now in my late 30s).  The reason for haven't visited a therapist is that I have the will to fight the suffocation I feel. I believe that by going to the therapist, I accept the fact that I am too weak to fight. I usually try with different strategies. Music, focus on the positive things. Stop visiting news websites. Cut off toxic people from my life. Drink (bad one I know, but I haven't touched alcohol for 6 months now). Exercise.

I also have a family that I truly love. The bad thing is that I only get good energy from my child. It's like I only live for her, nothing else satisfies me or makes me happy. It's like everything else in the world has no meaning. When she needs me, I find purpose. For 5 hours a day she's at daycare, I feel suffocating.

I believe that all of these years I was fighting depressing and winning. I had episodes of deep depression and episodes of uncontrolled happiness. I believe that I might be bipolar.

The therapist visit is my last ammunition and I will probably do this, I just don't want to take prescribed medication. I have the will to fight but I don't know what else to do. It seems that I've fallen in a hole I can't get myself easily out. So I am asking you.

What has helped you except meds?"

depression,Depression recovery struggles,"I have been recovering from depression past year, I feel happier and more fullfiled with myself. I enjoy time spent alone, which I hate when I was struggling since I would spiral. As i have been recovering; friends group I met during my darkest time hasn't changed and adapted. I feel like they don't listen to me but only criticise. When I tell them I am recovering and feeling very good since I started medication a year ago they shrug it off. No one told me directly they are proud of me or that I am doing incredibly well. In addition I realized their way of socializing doesn't fit me and started spending time with other people. Does anyone else experience similar thing? I wouldn't mind entire situation but I have been getting angry messages how I need to figure my shit out and pull myself together from them. I feel like I am doing something wrong but if I don't involve them in my life I feel happier since I recovered."
depression,I'm so depressed about the fact I can't leave Russia,"I think I just need a place to rant. I've been extremely depressed lately, and this is the only place which comes to my mind. I'm a software engineer and many of my colleagues are leaving or already left. I can't. I had a plan on how to emigrate, and according to it I have to spend another 2 years here, to obtain more experience and maybe a master's degree. I now have a little more than a year of experience, so nobody wants to bother to make visas for juniors. Yeah technically I can cross the border, but have no legal right to stay for longer or work. Nor do I have the money for this. I'd have to literally live on the streets in another country. So I stay here. Surrounded by nazies, having to use VPN for any kind of information, with no perspectives. I can't even help people in Ukraine. I went to protest, but it makes no sense. You even can't send money, because international transfers don't work, and you can also be jaild for 15 years for that. Everybody's crazy, they put new-nazi's symbols on their cars, make children in schools pose for it... Ask people to say the authorities if they know someone who ""discredits the Russian army""... It feels like the worst years of the USSR, though I've never lived there. My mother's husband said to my face that my Ukrainain relatives deserve to be bombed and starve. My God, I hate everything so much."

depression,No matter what I do it's just the same,"Just needing to vent.
Every time I try to do better, I end up feeling the same. I'm over-weight and I tell myself that it's okay and I will start exercising and eating better but I have no motivation 99% of the time and I also every time I visit my dad, he is always telling me I need to drink water and he compares me to my sister who is the skinny one. I sometimes do starve myself for days and then I will binge.

I know I need professional help because I always have those bad thoughts that I'm not good enough, I'm too fat, everyone would be better off without me, I just want to kill myself, but I can't get help. I have no insurance and don't money to pay a hospital or a therapist. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, my partner always gets upset when I do talk to them about it, and I don't have any friends. I've always been too sensitive, and every little thing just makes me think too much. I can never stay at a job for too long, people can be so fucking rude too you over nothing.

I've tried doing drugs and drinking but my body doesn't like to react to it how it should. It takes me double and triple the amount with drugs just too feel something that last more than a minute and I can drink all I want but my brain always has to ruin it. One minute I will be all drunk and happy and then the next I will be sober and in my head. 

I just want to die. I believe in God, and I pray to Him all the time to just let me come home to Him, but now I don't even want to do that because I feel like I'm disappointing Him or/ making Him annoyed. 

I tried killing myself three times but the only thing it did was make me feel like shit, I'm pretty sure I fucked up my kidney.

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't kill myself correctly and living just so hard, but then I feel guilty about feeling this way because I have so much when others have so little. And now I might be pregnant, I hungry and tired all the time now. I have to take another test in a couple days because the line was too faint. I don't want to bring a baby into this shitty world, plus being pregnant and depressed is bad for the baby."
depression,Progress doesn't help,"Tired of seeing advice for depression having to due with progress and improving life. That if you get 1% better everyday that things will get back to 100%. It's simply not true. 

Three years ago, I never left me bed and smoked weed constantly. I paid for university and didn't go to a single class. I didn't talk to anyone, online and especially in person. I did 0 things in a day but exist. 

Two years ago, I got a job working 9-5 at minimum wage. I saved up and paid off my student debt fully. I bought myself clothes and games and even managed to make some connections with coworkers. I was sober. On my time off work however, I just sat and thought of how I'm not accomplishing much, and this was to be my life forever. 

This year, I'm back in university. Im only a half year away from graduating with a finance degree, and have been getting top marks in most my classes. I work out 3-4 times a week and diet on top. I sometimes go out on weekends with friends to get drinks. At night, I smoke a little and read a lot. I have a balanced day start to finish that's often full with responsibilities I fulfill. 

You know what hasn't changed? I'm depressed. Maybe worst than I was more. I'm closer to ending it. It doesn't matter what I add or subtract. I find no meaning to life. This is an illness, not a life state."

Me, being stubborn, decided to find her. I check out a couple of her favorite places and found her in nearby town. I gave her sweets that I bought for her earlier and sat besides her in silence.
I knew that she takes long walks to avoid people so I didn't want to force any conversations. 
After 2 hours of wandering around the town L headed to her home. I walked her there and we parted ways. 

Her phone is still turned off. I don't know what should I do. Will visiting her today be fine or is it too much? Will it be too selfish and annoying? I don't want make her angry but I'm really worried. Her mental state was getting worse lately and I don't want to let her attempt again.

I was 13 years old, and I wrote “I sometimes wish I wasn’t here. If I weren’t here I wouldn’t know it.” I wrote some other things about “nobody would miss me until I’m gone” and “The only person I have is you God, so please please help me.” And this just hurts me so bad like after reading that I just can’t stop crying because I still feel this way.

depression,My experience...," 

Hi Everyone 

I just joined this group and wanted to share an experience I hope will offer encouragement to anyone who is in the same position I once found myself. Earlier in my life I had some serious issues with anxiety and depression. After spending some time utilising various coping mechanisms I experienced a particularly difficult period. This experience was horrific. It made me wish I had never been born. But it terrified me so much it spurned me into action. I decided to abandon the coping strategy I had clung to and pursue the root cause of my issues. I believed that if I found the root cause I would be able to address this and cure myself of these symptoms for good. I made a list of treatments I thought might allow me to do this. I worked my way through this list. One of these approaches allowed me to get to the root cause of my depression and anxiety and resolve the issue. I went from being someone who was being crushed by the weight of my emotions to someone who wakes up with an optimistic attitude to life’s challenges. I now start my days with a genuine excitement about the future. I walked this path and made this transition. If you walk this path you can make the same discoveries, the same changes and be cured. "

depression,i think i’m going back into depression,hi. i’m 18 years old and i’ve been depressed for about 2 1/2 years now. it started my sophomore year and it was just normal depression over silly things i almost feel like break up losing my friends and just growing up. but it got worse into covid. i started smoking a lot and it wasn’t the best i dropped the sport i loved and just a stayed home and watched tv all day. i finally started to get out of it towards the end of the year and went back to football but i lost my best friend before the year ended. i’m not sure i haven’t ever felt the same since i’ve felt like i always see people with best friend they’re always with 24/7 and i just guess i never have it and don’t think i ever will. i also had a crush on this girl for 2 years but she had a bf they’re broken up and i told her how i feel but i don’t think she feels the same plus she just got out it doesn’t affected me much anymore idk y but i just have accepted it and all. i talked to one girl who really liked me but we couldn’t date because she’s going to another college. i asked her to prom but she already got asked. i haven’t ever been to a dnace really so i’m really nervous about it which is crazy but yeah so it’s just hard and i’m scared i won’t get to go to my last dance because idk who would go with me. i’m not ugly i think i’m the opposite but it’s just hard idk where to go anymore and all my fun was wasted by me.
depression,I have been existentially depressed and chronically bored for years.,"It started when I was 12 or so, I don’t remember what it was like very well back then, but I do remember dodging responsibilities and I got bored of things I used to like etc. I believe it came about after rejecting Christian religious beliefs after realizing it’s just a mythology that the indoctrinated indoctrinate to young, naive children. I got professional heath, and felt better. Got depressed again after a while, but this time with suicidal thoughts. I got professional heath again, but that did me nothing. Though I did overcome this episode after about a year or two. I had slowly started to get “back on track”. I started with my hygiene, then with my school grades. Fast forward a few years of being an A+ student and I am realizing that my depression has never left me. I am an agnostic and I often contemplate things when I am bored (which is a lot). I have been getting the symptoms I had at the very start, boredom and a sort of restless-tiredness. On the weekends I sleep 15 hrs or so, I find something to do and get bored in 15 minutes. Everything in my life seems like a boring chore that never ends, like a grind for nothing.
Sometimes I feel happy, but then I realize how stupid it all is. I cant stop thinking about how nothing matters and everything I do is meaningless. I wonder what I’m even still here for. I don’t have anyone I care about enough to keep living, I don’t have anything that seems worth waking up and doing all the tedious chores of my life. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of messing up, and if the next plane of existence is worse than this one. And now any form of help is useless because in the back of my head I know being “mentally heathy” is another way of saying distracted and oblivious to the truth and reality."
depression,I don’t know how to do this,"I’ve never made a post before. 

Idk how to do this. Idk how to do anything really. I feel like I’m stumbling through life for no reason. You know how people ask “what would you tell your younger self” I’d say just fucking do it. You know what I mean. JUST FUCKING DO IT. Spare everyone the trouble. It doesn’t get better. You keep hurting everyone around you. No one really wants you. They may act like they do sometimes but they make it apparent that they don’t really. they’d be so much better without you. It would all be so much better if you didn’t be in the first place. Never there to bother anyone. You just fuck everything up. You think hey this is actually going okay but oh wait no it’s not it’s just as bad as it ever was even worse actually because you made everyone think you were okay and then you pulled this stupid shit and made everyone hate you because you hate yourself and you want to not exist. You don’t wanna die necessarily. You want to have not been. You want to go back and make it possible that you weren’t even a thought. But that’s not possible. So just go back and end it before you met anyone in your current life. Yeah your parents might think of you and hurt a little bit but let’s be honest they’re gonna forget you existed they never cared anyway you weren’t the favorite or even the preferred. Didn’t matter how hard you tried. Where did that get you? Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. You fucking failure. JUST DO IT. Just disappear. Everyone will move on. You aren’t a significant mark in any ones life."
depression,I think people have been taught that suicide is bad and that is why they say not to do it.,[removed]
depression,My therapist and other friends of the past thinks my parents caused my mental issues. I'm not sure though. What should I do?,"The reason I'm asking this is because I don't know if I believe them. Ive had depression for the last 7 years and since I'm 25 going on 26 that's basically my entire adult life so far. But mostly all my life I've dealt with anxiety, super lower confidence, extreme lack of social skills to the point where I can't connect with people and sometimes just general anti social behavior from what I've been told. 

It's ruined my life in everyway possible. But my therapist and friends say that my parents have basically messed me up mentally and emotionally. I would like to not say so because I am an adult and a guy so I should be able to be mentally strong enough to move on no matter what. 

Because in my opinion my parents did a lot for me. I always had food. And they made sure I had clothes etc. There were a few downsides as my parents were protective so they didn't allow me to stay the night at my friends until I was a nearly a senior in high school. I also had a curfew at 8pm as well then which only was lifted after I graduated high school.

My parents pushed me to be great at everything. Including my looks as they would point out any flaw I had throughput the day like teeth not being super white or hair messy or didn't smell amazing even in public. Sports was big too. Even though after I stopped most of my family just called me a waste of size or they called me a bad return on investment.

And even as an adult they don't want me getting a job with a white population too large as they think I'll get hurt because I'm in a minority group. 

There's more to it but I don't think these things should have large impact into my adult life. And I think it's my fault that I'm not mentally stronger and fell into a 7 years major depression disorder that anti depressants can't even fix.  

Idk what to think anymore..do they have a point or am I just weak?"
depression,friend I met online blocks me after finding out I got pregnant because of him and I feel like my life is falling apart,"



im 15 turning 16 next month and from the philippines
I know im stupid and careless and irresponsible for letting this happen that i have been crying myself to sleep every night. ive been meeting him for weeks now and really liked him he was always sweet and kind and funny. i really felt safe being with him until one day he was upset because we still havent done ""anything"" and i didnt want to upset him because hes done so much for me already so I let him do what he wanted.

ill never forget how my mom shouted and slapped me saying me and my sister now have to work side jobs to raise money for an abortion and i agreed.
I know I have to have an abortion because my parents cannot afford to raise another child. my dad lost his job because covid here in the philippines is so bad.
some of my friends gave me some money for the abortion and i love them so much but its just not enough. abortion in the philippines is illegal so the clinic im going to is asking alot.

ive been calling the guy who got me pregnant to atleast help in paying the clinic but hes blocked me on all social media accounts. im so stupid and feel so angry towards myself for letting this happen. ive been having random break downs in my room and im always panicking and dont know what to do. im also scared to have an abortion because ive never done it.
i dont even know why im posting this here on the internet."
depression,Every sunday I want to die,"(vent) I'm just it happens to a lot that really hates what they're doing in life and suffers from depression.
Every sunday I want to die because I don't want to go back to pursue school in a field I don't like, where I know way less than my classmates and that my anxiety make me miss because I can't get through my front door in the morning.
Some days I just call in sick, hating myseld because I'm missing my education, promising myself I'll use this free time to catch up what I'm late behind... and then it's already 8pm and I did nothing, the day went fast while doing nothing. And so it starts again. 
5 days go by, it's friday evening, I'm relieved that the week is over, promise I'll work during the week end... saturday I stress about sunday and all the work I have to do, sunday goes by and nothing happened. I just know I'll have to go through another week. 
And in this situation I just want to end it all. Always finding a new way to die on my way to school. 
Rince and repeat.

I know I just need to be able to make a full week at school to feel somewhat less of a waste. But for now I struggle with that too."

I cut myself twice this week, I cried so hard I feel like vomiting and my body genuinely hurts....i feel like I am just a manifestation of everyone's hatred. I have wanted to die since I was 9 or so and it's just... exhausting.

No one seems to feel love or appreciation towards me, only hate and disgust. My bf told me to ""cry him a river"" when I tried to tell him I felt like he hated me. I called the suicide hotline and it didn't really help much, the person was very nice and gentle with me but it just made me sad that no one in my life talks to me that way or listens to me as much as they did ....

I guess I just desperately need human compassion and comfort right now, if anyone has any sort of phrases or something that help them when they feel like this I would really appreciate it...thank you~"
depression,I'm just so tired M14,"My friends hate me , they barely talk to me and if they do its talking shit about me or just bs and make jokes that hurt me alot and they constantly remind me how much I mean nothing and how I'm ugly, dumb but then they call me fat or that I need to eat more , I cant stand myself anymore,  everytime I look at myself I feel disgust,  out of place , I shouldn't be be here I just wanna die"
depression,"i do not want to go back. well, that’s another lie for you. i am so tired - indecisive yet again (shocker)","school is so exhausting when you only give a fuck about tomorrow, not what comes next. relationships are so exhausting when you only give a fuck about the person, not the relationship. next is so draining when you know your habits and that they will not change (they never fucking change and it’s already tomorrow. holy shit). so much was on the line, but i can’t tie anything back onto it. i will figure it out like i always do, but fuck, i just want to go to sleep. i can not go to sleep."
depression,I'm very very very very sad and disappointed in myself.,"Just the title. I'm too tired to even complain, rant or vent."
depression,I don’t know what to do. I do not know what to do.,"I sleep so much. I quit working a couple months ago because it’s gotten so bad... Nothing sounds fun. I was so social, and all of a sudden thinking of interacting with others makes me anxious. 

My bf has been so supportive, but I’m worried he’s starting to resent me for this depressive episode. I’m all over the place emotionally, whilst letting the house go to shit because I cannot bring myself to do anything. My limbs feel like lead. I’m only happy when he’s home from work, and I can curl up next to him and feel his arm around me. But it’s not his job to relieve me of this shit, and I’m worried I’m coming off as clingy or worse that he feels my happiness is dependent on him. It isn’t, I just don’t know how to move forward and he’s a comforting presence.

I haven’t been this bad since 2014, long before I met him. The last time I felt this low, I was selfish and put my family through two suicide attempts. I sometimes wish I’d succeeded but no, I just put my parents in debt given I was a minor at the time. I was shipped off to wilderness therapy and picked up some great coping skills in the 3.5 months I spent cut off from the world in the desert. It’s gotten me to today, where I no longer remember any of them and need help.

I got hired into a new job (I’m a behavioral therapist) but it doesn’t start until March 7th. I’ve made efforts the past couple weeks to do better — I had a dentist appt on Wednesday and my first therapy appt in years yesterday. It was over zoom and was an initial ‘get to know you’ session so I just kinda covered all the background info rather than delve into anything but I was at least a tiny bit proud of taking the steps I know I need to take.

But here I am, nearly 4am, recovering from a near panic attack but keeping quiet because my bf doesn’t deserve any more of my shit than he’s already put up with.

I just need help."

depression,Sad or Depressed,"I've felt rock bottom low for ten years, I constantly struggle to change the things that I thought make me sad or lonely but I just end up feeling the same despite the better job, nicer house etc. Am I depressed? I tried to talk to my doctor, he just told me to read a book called The Art of Not Giving a Fuck, which didn't really help."
depression,Please someone help I don’t know what just happened me,"Last year I began a battle with depression and it’s been a crazy 7 months since then. I’ve been on anti depressants since this all started and It’s made me be able to live a more normal life. Things have been going better in the past 4 months.

Since January I’ve been eating healthier then I ever have, I’ve been working out almost everyday and I’ve been looking to get a job again. I’ve genuinely been proud of myself for the first time in a long time. I started talking to this girl who I used to know and have been texting/calling her for the past month. She makes me really happy and I really like her.

Finally we scheduled a date a few days ago and I haven’t been this happy in forever. The day starts and I’m nervous and ecstatic to see her. Long story short the date was great. So heres the tricky part.

WHY DID I HAVE A CRYING FIT WHEN I GOT HOME. I feel exactly like I did when my depression started. My anxieties back and I’m feeling so down again. Why the fuck now when everything’s been going so well. There were no signs of this happening yet for the past three days it feels like I lost every part of me that was doing so well. My medication isn’t doing shit anymore so wtf do I do to get back to myself once again. 

Please someone tell me this is normal and that things will get back to the way they were soon. I really need help now because of this. Most of all I can’t ruin what I’ve started with this girl. It’ll kill me."

depression,Depression not only hurts me,"It also hurts my parents. They have always been very supportive but they have no idea what to do to help me.
It makes me feel even worse.

Yesterday I told them I wanted to resign on my job because I couldn't make it anymore. My bosses and co-workers definitely disrespect me. Many people can cope with such aggression at work but I just can't.
They are super worried, they are afraid that I will never be able to work and have a normal stable life with a good job, a wife and kids.

All my parents want is to see me happy but ever since I entered high-school, things have gotten worse and worse.

I managed to build a new social circle almost from scratch after college (because for some reason, people I believed to be my friends in college stopped communicating with me afterwards, even though I've tried to keep in touch with them). But I realized that all these new people I met aren't true friends.
I can't open up to them about anything serious. 
I'm also still single. Never had a girlfriend or whatever (I'm 27).
This is probably the thing that hurts me the most. Knowing that no one will ever love me because I'm basically un-lovable.
The only exception are my parents and yet I keep disappointing them all the time.

I wanted to end it all but my parents would probably die too if I killed myself. Well, I'm pretty sure that my depression already shortened their life expectancy. It's terrible because I'm basically slowly killing the only people who really care about me.

Sorry, it might be very confused, I didn't really know where I was going with this post... Just needed to writer these things apparently."
depression,"I have trash (not biohazard trash) literally sitting on the floor and don't even use a bag that's 1cm away to put the rest of the trash in, someone observed that I probably have depression because they used to live like that too.

depression,I'm so tired I just want to fall asleep and sleep for a long time,"I guess I have depression and I think I had it most of my 20s and I think as years go by it just gets harder problems get harder energy goes down even more and then you get close to 30 and start dealing with all the feelings that go along with that milestone. And then I had a pet loss like 6 months ago and that was the worst and I realized that when she was alive how the fuck could I be sad at least I had her. Depression ruins everything you always focus on what's missing and feel miserable

I'm so freaking tired My parents are hopeful for me to find a job and career but feeling motivated is so freaking hard and I think being alone for years with no friends and never having had a boyfriend also saps motivation. I wish I was married by now with a man who takes care of me and loves me. I feel like that would be energizing and solve my problems. But I never felt good enough or pretty enough"

depression,Getting better intimidates me,"I know what steps I need to take first. It just seems so fucking scary, knowing that at any time I can get worse again. Staying at rock bottom isn't as bad as falling back down. It's the feeling of knowing that you're getting worse... knowing that everything you worked for is gonna be thrown away. Getting better feels just as hard as suicide, which is why I'm afraid. I just don't want to end up at square one again. I guess I find comfort in knowing I can't get worse (jk it always gets worse)"
depression,I'm so irritated with people misunderstanding psychopaths as mass murderers and monsters,"We are judged for being aware of the weaknesses of empathy and simply being more logical most of the time. It doesn't offend me or anything, since I'm pretty much not able to get offended, but it's just simply annoying and the amount of misconceptions about psychopaths is insane."
depression,what now,"i don’t know what to do anymore, i feel like i know these other people who have chronic depression but they have coping habits, healthy or not whether it be self injurious behaviors or drugs or co dependence or anything. and i’m just to a point where that doesn’t fix it i can never ever get better. i am alone whether or not i’m fucking related to. it’s not about oh “you’re loved” or anything nothing helps. i‘be tried everything healthy or not therapists, meds, anything and i just feel like what the fucking point anymore. i’m just a kid i don’t know what’s happening i don’t know who i am or where i wanna be and i wish i could just be normal and fix it and anything. i cannot believe this is glorified. i’m am in the agony i created for myself. i am my own fucking demise. i just need to know what’s next because i’m at such a huge loss of what to do anymore."
depression,I don't get it...,I don't get it. I met the love of my life and felt we were so compatible. He felt the same way. I became depressed because of the many things in my life I couldn't handle. I almost killed myself and didn't tell him because of the many things he was dealing with. I also am afraid he would have left me because people have left me before due to my depression. I broke up with him in a weird way because I needed time to heal and didn't want him to suffer in the relationship. It would have taken a toll on him. He can't forgive me because I wasn't honest with him and lost trust in me and no longer thinks we were compatible. My depression ruins everything.

depression,having a career crisis rn and idk what to do anymore,"im 20 and a first year college. Ive always been in love with the arts and I draw, take pictures, and do music production. 

 I took Multimedia Arts in college so I can explore more other artforms but Ive always wanted to take music production bcos ive been very very into music and thats one thing that makes me stand out.  But i didnt take music production because i dont want my creativity to be limited and not be insecure with the fundamentals of it ++ tuition is very expensive. 

bcos ive been so into music, I lost my adrenaline with drawing. I can still draw but I just dont have that crave of sketching anymore, it feels more like an household chore. it's one of the reasons why i took MMA cos I might just get that spark back.  I also took MMA so I can earn money and save up for music gears for my artist career. Ive always wanted to play on stage and go touring w a band or record in my solo act. MMA is literally just a Plan B bcos who knows I might not sell with music. 

I'm already getting torn with studying MMA though. That one semester is very creatively draining and exhausting. I'm starting to not like taking pictures (bcos I do film photography, I dont have a DSLR yet bcos it's expensive and unfortunately, film is also getting expensive so that leaves me burned out and broke).  

And then all of my music mutuals are releasing their albums, eps, new singles. My 3 songs in spotify are like back in 2019 and the other one is just last year. I've been trying to build just one ep and I still havent finished it. I'm getting insecure and jealous whenever I see my friends performing and doing gigs. I feel very useless and like I cant do anything. 

 I'm starting to think of training as a barista, but tuition is also expensive and I really want to do it. I might have to stop for a year in college, but in order not to disappoint my family, I must do well in my training and get a job so I can at least be financially stable. 

 But these days, I'm trying to practice latte art during 2nd semester (I havent gone to my classes completely bcos of my burn out and it's rlly getting out of hand), I keep failing my latte arts, i dont know what Im doing wrong and it's been a week of coffee and latter art researching and practice and I just couldnt get it. I just want to be prepared and have that stable hand motion when pouring milk to the coffee for latte art and I just cant. 

 Meanwhile, my non binary boyfriend in Ireland (we're 11,240km apart), is just a bit younger than me but they already have a job and is very mature already. I cant really talk to them right now with what Im feeling because it's either theyre asleep or theyre at work and that leaves me feeling lonely. I cant really sleep thru it bcos I have a very very bad sleep sched so everyone's asleep and Im just up in the middle of the night with fuzz in my head. All I got is insomnia and oversleeps.  

I am in a very very lost place right now. I don't know what to do at all, I'm having a hard time functioning day by day, I'm overwhelmed. 

I feel dumb, useless, and comparable. and im broke too ;((  I thought I had my life planned but idk what to do at all to organize. I cant seem to look forward anymore.   
   
p.s. I don't think im capable of receiving phrases like ""oh im sorry. i hope you can find your path soon"" something like that, bcos honestly it's very hard for me to imagine my future. I would love to read similar stories from u guys tho!! id also appreciate practical tips or mind changing ones if u guys know something!!"

depression,I’ve resorted to coming here..,"I… idk what to say. Idk how this works. I don’t use Reddit often. I’d just rather not be insulted or anything rn. I’m an 18 year old guy who is currently having a mental breakdown. I have hereditary depression, which is a real thing, but I don’t often have breakdowns. But I’ve been experiencing extreme sadness and depression for a while now. However, I’ve been bottling up everything. I’m too much of a coward to actually ask for help or confide in someone. My cousin is also having bad depression, so I’ve been trying to be strong for him. But it’s getting too hard. My brain is torturing me with people from my past. It’s some real petty shit that is causing me all this pain. But idk what to do. I don’t want to die, but at the same time, I just want all of this shit to end. I won’t kill myself though for the sole reason of my family finding my lifeless body. I can’t bare to imagine their reactions. But then sometimes I do just wanna stop all this mental pain. For a while now, I’ve been putting all my pain into writing. And every single day, I just try to distract myself from the pain. But it doesn’t always work. I’m at a point in my life where I feel like I self sabotaged too much. I’m lonely as fuck. I have like no friends because I dropped them all years ago. I also have Asperger’s syndrome, which really doesn’t help. That and my social anxiety. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so trapped.

Recently went to a psychiatrist because of a panic attack at work and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and was told by the doctor to resign from work as it might make things worse down the road (working at a call center). 

I just feel so weak right now, like I'm unconsciously faking things just to get out of a hard time. I have some savings to work with while I'm unemployed. Everything just feels so complicated and it feels like my meds and consultations with my psychiatrist will bleed the small amount of money I've saved up dry, I really just want to end it all. I don't deserve to live being this pathetic."
depression,Please help me.,"**tw: suicide**

I don't know how to start this. My head feels like it's going to explode, I'm shaking from both anger and hurt, and everything in the world seems incredibly shitty. I feel terrible and the only thing on my mind is that I want to end my life. I'm obviously not going to do it -- I'm safe. Just in the wrong headspace.

I had a situation/argument with a friend as soon as I woke up. 50 messages from her side, though not saying any one of us were entirely in the wrong. Loads of miscommunication, arguments, saying I'm ""attacking"" her friends and her blah blah you get the point. I was slightly petty in the beginning too but tried my best to communicate. After whatever happened at the end, I felt like an absolute cunt. A shitty person and a shitty friend even though I tried my best to put forth what was bothering me. Ended up feeling so so miserable ad a weight on my chest as soon as I woke up.

An hour later, as I type this, I had an AWFUL argument full of yelling and screaming with my mother. Keep in mind my relationship with my mother has always been unstable -- again, not anyone's fault. Just normal mommy issues and loads of miscommunication even though I've tried my best to forgive and understand her side lmao. But after every, and this argument too, I ALWAYS feel like THE person who is at fault. Makes me realize that I shouldn't have brought this xyz thing up or mentioned the one thing that bothered me because people find it so SO easy to throw it back into my face. I'm obviously a sensitive person, and every time, EVERY fucking time I try to communicate, I'm the person at fault. Not just with my mother, but with this friend today too, I'm the shitty person. I'm the bad friend. I'm a bad person. I'm a bad daughter. 

As my mom argued, she claimed that no matter how good daughters are -- some part of them will always be jealous of their mother, aka me. This made me very sad and VERY angry. I love my mother with all my heart, and yes we have our differences, but I've never EVER thought of her this way. I've tried my best and I occasionally do get very loud and angry and say the wrong things, but so does she. Anyway, she claimed I'm jealous of her because I told my dad that she has a habit of always wanting to be right -- which is again, the way i view her. She got angry at that and said I'm always trying to turn my dad against her which is insane talk. She's always trying to make me feel very fucking excluded from my OWN family (her, my dad, and my older brother) every time I try to take part in a conversation. She says I have no right to comment anything about her to my dad or my brother because I only have a negative perception of her. When I was younger, any time I'd try to make a joke with my older brother -- she'd cut me off and make things more strained than it needs to be between my brother and I. I like to think this is half the reason my brother and I stopped speaking from a very young age. We barely talk now and when we do, it's all very formal/small talk.

This brings me to my last point -- my life has a funny way of always making me feel excluded from things. I'm the person that's left out, discarded, projected on, a fucking movie villain in everyone's lives. I can't make a joke with my brother because everything is my fault and apologize to your brother because he's sensitive and doesn't open up easily while you're loud and can talk about your feelings so obviously your brother is suffering more than you are! Your feelings don't matter because occasionally people hear you! (No one does. But my mother likes to think so.)

I can't remember the last time anyone else was as interested in my life and I as I am with other people, nor can I recall when someone gave a shit about my feelings. I'm not a boring person by any means, but people just never want to get to know me the way I do with them. With certain friends, with my own fucking family, etc. It's always there. I'm the background character that loves to get to know people and involve myself, but gets absolutely shat on every time they try. A life like this and constant situations like these always perpetuate the idea in my head that I'm truly better without anyone in my life. No one is ever interested in me or cares for me and I'm all alone."

They became so traumatized and she was so refusing to get help I finally filed for divorce and restraining order based on her crazy actions. She went from rehab, to sober living, to another rehab for a couple years. I kept contact because I loved her and wanted her to get better. After a few years she started to get better. The kids were starting to do great now they didn't have to deal with the drama of addiction and parents that were fighting. 

I started to allow supervised visitations with kids and started to bond with her again. Fast forward a few months and she has a near death experience due to a bleeding ulcer and I decided to allow her to move in with us from her sober living with the understanding that she would continue to work on her sobriety and get a job. Any job. I didn't care where and I didn't need to see any of the money. She just needed to be responsible enough to maintain a job.

She recovers from her surgery, and for the next two years we live together with ups and down. She stopped the opiate abuse but then started huffing aerosols. I catch her with that and eventually she stops but the weight loss drugs are a recurring abuse whenever she can scam enough money from me to get them.  No job.

Our house we are renting is being sold so we have to find a new place. I am tired of renting and tell her, please, get a job and I will buy a house and pay all the bills but you have to handle your own expenses.

I manage to buy a house on a single income in southern california which is no joke. She never get a job. She spirals into depression. She starts drinking heavily. At this point I know I made a mistake letting her move back in. The kids are suffering. Grades are going to shit. They are angry and depressed. Reflections of the relationship they see between us.

My wife is upset I am distant. I say, I have only asked one thing of you and that is to get a job. Its been 4 years and you have not been able to do it. I can't be loving when I am so disrespected. Gaslighting becomes a common experience.  I know I should break it off but am afraid will separation cause more harm for my kids than good. They were traumatized when we separated before. I decide to try to mediate peace as best as I can for sake of my kids.

Last year my oldest son tells me I think Mom might be cheating on you..   Couple months later my youngest son calls me at work saying a strange man is in our house. I leave work and confront her and him and she admits that she has been seeing someone else.

I immediately blow up and say. Its done. I call a real estate agent that week and the house is up for sale by the next week. 

We sold the house. I gave her half and me and the kids moved to an apartment. The kids don't want to have anything to do with her anymore. She keeps coming back trying to reconcile. But she keeps lying and going back to this dude.

6 months later and she has run through 130K dollars that I gave her. Her alcohol abuse is insane. I want her to get better for her and her children. I keep trying to be supportive. But it is hard. She has taken so advantage of me it is not even funny. When she is wasted she is mean to me and the kids.

I have started drinking too much in response to all the trauma. What I don't understand is when I am drunk I am sad and miss her. When she is drunk she is mean and blames everyone for her problems. No responsibility taken.

This hurts so bad. I know I need to just break all contact. But it is hard. I do love her. I do wish her the best and want her to get better. I do realize addiction is a terrible disease that destroys you and those around you. I want to see her rise up from it. But I can't take anymore abuse.

So scared of the financial impact a divorce is going to cause me since she has refused to work for the last 18 years. I already gave her 130k that she blew in six months. I give her $400 every two weeks since we split. I crunched the numbers and in California I am supposed to pay even more for eternity as alimony. I can't afford to pay for a place to live based on that. I went from owning a 3 bedroom house to sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with me and my two kids and can barely afford it.

It is so depressing. I am afraid of my future. I have started drinking more than I am comfortable with in an attempt to self medicate for the depression this is causing.

I day dream of quitting my job and buying an RV and just vanishing with the kids. The kids are done with her because of all the drama. I have to force them to spend time with her. It suck being her advocate when she treats me like shit. But that is the right thing.

Sometimes I dream of just dying. Because I can't take anymore of this bullshit. I won't, because I have two teenage boys who need me.

Please forgive my venting. I have not ever really let all this out and I need to before I crack.

It is so sad when you put so much effort into something and have it implode around you despite all your effort.

It makes you just want to give up completely.   :("
depression,Opinions on seeing a psychiatrist?,"So I’ve been depressed/had depression since I was about 12 but only started really seeking help for it in terms of meds a year ago, I’m 20 now. I’ve tired 2 types of ssri’s so far those being sertraline and fluoxetine but I hated how they made me feel and the side effects they had (no libido, couldn’t orgasm, headaches ect) so I went off them for a while but found that I couldn’t really handle my depressive episode with therapy alone. I’ve been in and out of therapy for most of my adolescence trying CBT and DBT but I found they didn’t really work that much especially when I’m in the midst of an episode.

The last time I saw my doctor i asked if there was anything I could take and after a lot of deliberation she put me on agomelatin but that hasn’t even put a dent in my depression. 

While my doctor is great she isn’t very experienced in mental health medications so I’m wondering if I would be worth it to see a psychiatrist and talk over medication with them.

I’m in aus so a psychiatrist would be around 400-600 aud but I would get about half of that back with a rebate. Is there any point in me really seeing a psych for something so common and what else could I go on that would work but not give me such horrid symptoms?

TLDR: don’t like ssri’s and agomelatin isn’t working, doctor isn’t very well versed in mental health meds, thinking of seeing a psychiatrist but kinda expensive wondering if it’s even worth it?"
depression,Why does everyone treat me like I'm a boring unfunny nobody?,"Whenever other people make comments, they always get laughs; literally if I'm in a group of six people, everyone makes a comment and the others find them funny, but when I do, no-one laughs. I'm always the odd one out and I hate it. Why is it that constantly when I talk, people give me an awkward glare like there's something wrong with me? I remember even back from a couple of years ago, everyone treated me like I wasn't even there. I want to be more outgoing, but when I do, this always happens. I've tried so hard to stay positive but why do people shit on the last bit of positivity that I have in my heart. I don't want to be depressing, I want to be happy, I want to be funny, I want to be optimistic, but it's so hard. When people ignore me or treat me like I'm unfunny or whatever, I just feel weak and defenseless and like I'll be stuck in this situation forever. I hate how there's nothing I can do about this."

depression,On antidepressants…I feel different…Was I supposed to be like this all along?,"This is probably a very common question amongst people taking antidepressants for the first time. I’ve started taking it and I can’t believe the immense change in my mood. I’m not overly happy, just okay, not lingering on thoughts that make me sad etc..Just feel like I’ve “changed the channel”. Which state is the “reality?” My current state or the pre antidepressan state?  Is this how I was meant to be feeling all this time? What if me being overly obsessive is just a personality trait that I blunted?   
Im not complaining about my results but it does make me wonder the potential I could have reached if I were on these a long time ago."
depression,Another year of my life wasted.,"I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. In 3 months I'll be 22 and what do I have to show for it? Absolutely nothing. Still in the same room I've been in since I was 10 or 11. Yeah, I could've left years ago, and I could leave at anytime I want, get a job and finally start living my life, but for some reason I haven't yet. But anytime I have a reason for why I haven't or can't or don't it's always labeled as an excuse and I'm repeatedly told that I should by sheer willpower just negate my depression and anxiety and pull myself up by my bootstraps instead of playing victim. I'm just tired of hearing them always say the same thing that only I can control what happens in my life, but it feels like they just say that so they don't have to empathize with me. If you don't care or don't want to be supportive just say that instead.

They don't understand what it's like to feel worthless and weak. I feel like this every day and it's a confidence killer. I would constantly be kicked when I was down to the point where now I don't even feel comfortable in my own skin anymore and I feel like I can't do anything at all, so I hesitate putting myself out there because I'm afraid failing or being humiliated.

Any effort made at anything feels like it isn't good enough or pointless. Any praise or compliment feels false or is overshadowed by negative thoughts. Feeling like I don't have a purpose in life. Feeling like I don't belong or inferior to people who are doing better than me. Everything is overwhelming and it's impossible to act like I can overcome whatever life throws at me with all these feelings and thoughts popping up in my head every minute of the day. I wish I could just find the confidence, motivation, aspiration or whatever the hell it is that everyone who seems to have life figured out has and break the cycle."

depression,"My brain holds me hostage and I have no urge to kill myself, so I'm stuck in this never ending loop","I am so very tired.

I don't ruminate and have suicidal ideation anymore, except when something or someone triggers me, which is cool I guess.

However, this anhedonia is killing me. I have things that interest me, that get me excited and hyped, but I just don't have the energy to do that.  
I used to watch a lot of tv shows and anime and I haven't really done that in a bit more than a year, it feels like a chore.  
I started reading (light) novels especially, and I could read for hours, but in the last few months I just can't. My attention span is horrible, my concentration is so low.  
If by miracle I find the strenght to watch an anime/tv show or read a novel, 5mins later I lose my attention/concentration and want to be done with it ASAP even if I like/I'm excited to do what I'm doing.  
This is the only enternainment I have. I watch short YT videos if something interesting pop up, refresh my socials, read a few chapters of the manga I follow (even though doing so feels so forced and exhausting) and that's about it. I have things I want and need to do, but I just can't.  
I was supposed to try working out again in January, and not only did I not do that, but I gained weight, like wtf is wrong with me.  
I'm still trying to work out, but I just don't. Next month I'm gonna go to the gym and see if it works for me.  
I'm supposed to get a job, and years later I'm still jobless, it gives me anxiety and used to give me panic attacks plus massive suicidal thoughts.  
Lately, I wake up late in the morning, to a few hours later, take a nap in the afternoon because even though I got stuff (I want) to do, I just can't, so I'm bored, and the only thing I can do is sleep. Then I wake up before dinner, eat, go to bed again, do all the things I said above (socials, reading some manga) and wish for me to go to sleep asap to pass the time and wake up the next day.

I used to want to kill myself because of all the bad things I told myself, insecurities, stress and anxiety.  
And now I don't want to die anymore, but I'm trapped in a body that just can't do shit. Sadly it doesn't me want to kill myself, so I just wait and do nothing, waiting for something (god knows what) to happen, but nothing ever happens.  
I'm bored, tired, I want to do things but I have no energy to do that, it makes me cry sometimes."

depression,I have always felt felt like I’m inferior to everyone else but recently it feels like the joy and excitement in my life has finally been completely sucked dry.,"This is a bit of a rant but I just wanted to get this off my chest.

For as long as I remember I’ve been helping my family doing chores and gardening expecting nothing in return but then being treated lesser then my younger siblings who do nothing but fight each other.

Ive had a lot of hobby’s in my life but recently I feel like I’m actually going backwards in my skills and just feel extremely bitter about it.

Every time I’ve tried to organise something with people I used to call friends I’m either just ignored or people just give shitty excuses even though i can tell they’ve just been excluding me from things and when I try to confront them about it they claim it’s my fault for taking it personally and then claim how I’d rather isolate my self and wallow in self pity ignoring that they are the ones who exclude me from things.

I’ve had two jobs and I’ve done everything to my best ability but I was fired from both jobs without given a reason as to why.

I don’t know why this happens to me but I’ve already given up on the people I used to call friends and I’m seriously considering just giving up on my hobby’s and passions."

depression,I’m tired…,"I got up for an hour. And already I’m too tired to even sit in a chair. I can’t get out of bed, I really want to but I can’t.

I just want this suffering to end."
depression,I constantly feel like everyone hates me or pities me,"I think I've picked this up from high school. 

I had a friend group that I'd sit with at lunch but one day I realized they never really liked me. Basically it was like wow no one cares when I speak. Like I could disappear for a year and no one would notice. I was just the butt of jokes really. So I got another friend group. They were a lot nicer to me but unfortunately I picked up another bad rationale. They're only friendly to me because they pity me having barely any friends. 

In college I assumed everyone was friends with me because I had a ride, weed, alcohol, or knew a decent amount of people due to those first three things. I had a handful of friends I wouldn't doubt they liked me though because they were weird in the way I was weird so it made sense and we're still friends just obviously not as close due to life. 

I'm noticing now this has always been affecting my relationships since thinking about it. I oftentimes want to reach out but don't because ""they probably think I'm weird af and I should take the hint they don't like me and leave them alone"" which coincides with my stupid following of ""set it free and if it comes back then it loves you"" except I'm setting it free every time and I'm surprised it keeps coming back until it obviously doesn't because I'm not putting in effort because I don't want to get hurt when they come to their senses and stop pitying me and leave. 

Right now I've been dating this awesome dude for two weeks. He really seems to like me but I really don't know why. We've been hanging out like 3 times a week and then some more online gaming when we aren't together in person. 

But I've been falling back into my bullshit insecurities. I shouldn't text him because he probably thinks I'm annoying or doesn't like me and I should just wait for him he'll come back if he actually likes me. We go on another great date, we sleep together per usual, split after breakfast, and mid afternoon when I'm alone it's ""he obviously doesn't like me set him free he'll come back if it's meant to be"" all over again. Being ghosted in the past doesn't help but it's not an excuse. 

This probably has to do with me hating myself. I commonly go through the day non ironically saying I'm a garbage person. I only have a few friends because I'm trash and they pity me.

I got in a fender bender a few days ago and still want to die whenever I think about it. What kind of idiot causes that and although the guy I hit said there was no damage and he was incredibly chill, I've probably permanently damaged his back and my actions are just idiotic, I should turn in my keys and just stop ruining people. He asked if I was ok and I was too busy apologizing and rethinking all my actions to prevent this from happening again and how I possibly could make it up to this poor man besides just giving him my insurance to even ask if he was ok.  It's like I'm so busy beating myself up because I feel like I deserve it.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to get close to people because why would anyone like me, they'll just leave."

depression,Emotional pain is worse than physical pain for me personally,"It is almost my birthday. I want to kill myself on my 20th birthday. I am not certain on how to approach it but I want to. I cant bear this pain I am feeling right now. It’s embarrassing that I had 2 attempts and I even failed to do that. I have no one to turn to. I feel completely alone. I have to realize that being depressed lowers my chance on having a stable social life. I’ve always push close people away. Lost many close companion. And I’ve always hated that I yearn for companionship. I always wanted to focus on school andgetting a job but feeling this loneliness is a pain I cannot tolerate anymore. It’s a lot easier to be certain that I no longer want to live. I think I’m ready now. I know that yes there is a possibility that in the future, I can tolerate my depression and live happier. But not right now. The pain is so unbearable. Thoughts are racing through and I feel like I have no one to share it to. If you read through all of this, I just want you to know that I really really appreciate it. The idea of someone hearing my torment is enough. You must be suffering as well and I understand it, more than ever before."

depression,I love life but my anxiety is killing me.,"Long story short. About 5/6 years ago I got beaten up by some guys badly , that ended with me with a nosebleed and me saying sorry despite it not being my fault at all. To make things worse someone recorded the whole thing. But it never got public or posted anywhere , I eventually got over this incident within a couple months / year. This year almost 1/2 weeks ago it has made a horrible comeback. Im with the most amazing girlfriend Ive ever had and life just hasnt been better like this, In amidst all these Im constantly terrorised about this video resurphasing or my amazing girlfriend seeing it someone. I have talked to a psychiatrist regarding this and he has given me all the help and suggestion he could but I am still unable to get the lingering thought or anxiety off me. This issue bothers me way too much and no matter what I cant get the negativity away from my mind. Its scaring me and I dont know what to do. Can someone help me ?"

depression,"Don't keep toxic ""friends"" around","Growing up as a kid me and my family moved cities a lot (because my dad's job required it), so each year for me was a new place, school and faces. Needless to say that was fucking horrible for me, imagine that dreaded ""first day at school"" but every single year. It made me extremely shy and horrible at socializing. Every new school I went everyone already knew each other since kindergarten, so I would always stand out as the new weird kid.

So when I was around 10 or something we moved to a new town that we would thankfully end up living for the next 6 years. There I met this kid that enjoyed everything I did and we became best friends instantly. We were besties until at 15 he moved out of town with his parents, and, at that time, I missed him dearly. Sounds good, right? I used to think like that... the thing is, as I grew older and became an adult I realized how much of a toxic asshole he was and how much damage he did to my mental health. I just had never noticed it because I was just so fucking desperate to have a friend. 

He would take any chance to demean me in front of everybody. You see, I was terrible in math (and he, the son of a super cool rich engineer, wasn't). He would call me a moron and a failure. I dreaded showing my tests to him, he was always a straight A student, while I would struggle. I remember once I was at his house and he did that in front of his older sister, I felt so fucking embarrassed. But I never lashed out, because he was right, I was a dumbass that wouldn't go nowhere in life.

What really affected me tho was how he called me a fatass. Growing up I was a really chubby kid, and he would taunt me all the time because of this (not only him, other people at class would make fun of me too, but he did it religiously). That fucked me up so hard that one day I would stop eating almost everything, I literally only ate a sandwich with salad in the morning and a plate of rice and beans on lunch. All that went for about a month or so, until my parents noticed and forced me to eat normally again (I went from 100kg to 70kg).

Looking back now as an adult and seeing how much I endured without saying a thing really disgusts me. I wish I could go back in time and cut every bond I had with him. I still carry his insults with me, I have zero confidence in everything I do and in my appearance... and I know I could change this, I could overcome this stupid childhood trauma with therapy, but honestly at this point in my life I have given up on everything, many other terrible things happened that are completely unrelated to this guy, way worse stuff. I just posted this here because I want to know if anyone else had similar issues, with toxic friends and shit.

Don't keep toxic mfs like this around."
depression,Figuring out my depression,"I’ve been depressed before but it’s never been this bad or maybe It’s becoming harder to ignore. I keep pushing off my depression as my anxiety instead as well as my adjustment disorder due to going into college soon. But it’s starting to interfere with relationships and harder to handle. Most of the time during the day and at school I can focus and stay on track without feeling too down but once I get home I feel sorta dead inside. It’s hard for me to gauge how bad my depression is or if it’s actually just anxiety. I have moments of happiness and enjoyment when I hang out with friends or with my mom but it’s becoming harder to really enjoy those moments. And when it comes to hanging out with friends that’s actually done online and not even in real life. I believe Im actually enjoying those moments but once it’s over I’m just sitting there feeling pathetic and worthless, where I then spiral into questioning everything. Am I faking this for attention? Am I actually depressed? I think even most of my happiness is coming from sugar highs as I’ve been eating more sugar. So am I actually having real genuine happy moments? is it from sugar/caffeine? Am I just escaping? I also wouldn’t ever commit suicide as I have people who do care about me and I know it would hurt them but honestly if I was like hit by a car or I was shot I wouldn’t care. I’d be sad to know my mom would hurt but for my own well being its whatever. Then when it comes to the future I ask myself what’s the point? I’m not even really doing this for myself

At times I wish I could jump into a different reality. At times at school I just want everything to suddenly stop where I can just take a deep breath n have silence. I think about every other week I’ve just had a night of crying for no reason and feeling sad but then I think why am I even crying? There’s not a clear reasoning. I’m on track to graduate with a great gpa and I have my needs met so what is there to even be depressed about? When it comes to real world interactions I feel normal but deep down I’m just sad. I’m also lonely and wish I had a real life friend. I don’t really know where my depression is coming from and for some reason I feel resistance on going to get help even when my mom is a literal psychologist… like what’s with that? I told my friend about how I feel and they told me I’m being stubborn and should talk with my mom but it’s not even like I don’t want help it’s more like somethings holding me back and I’m not sure what is. I’ve joked about it with my mom and she’s offered me to see someone but I just laugh it off and say naaa. Is this on me? Maybe I’m afraid? I want to figure this out"

I tell them how I got them always and I want to, but it's so draining on me.

depression,No Trust,"It's exhausting not being able to trust.

Having been severely bullied, having been abandoned by whole friend groups, having been cheated on in a serious relationship.  It takes a LOT of convincing for me to open up.  Whether that's sharing personal and vulnerable things with friends, or committing myself fully to a relationship without doubts that I would be better off single.  My anxiety throws in intrusive thoughts all the time.  I really just prefer not to talk about myself.  People think it's so weird as if all I can do is have small talk, but it's not that.  I am happy to talk about all kinds of complex and serious topics, or to explore other people's history, but there's a serious block pushing me to avoid talking about my personal issues or feelings.  

It's exhausting being on guard and preparing to be on defense all the time rather than being able to just let me mind rest in the comfort and continuity of trusting the current state of things, and my current company."
depression,I need some help,"Hello everyone! today after lots of crying alone in my bed I decided that I want to try to get better. I moved to a new country for college, but can't leave my dorm cuz I am so fucking depressed. I don't know how people carry on with their lives, but I want to be like them. Be normal. 

So I am asking how to I try to get better? What do I do? I don't have any friends, I have parents in a different country but I am not comfortable with reaching out to them because they were very abusive. So what can I do to be normal? How do I become productive even with this my shit mental? I just need so directions or something. I am so fuck sacred that I will always feel this sad. I need a way out."

depression,Need help conversing with someone who might or might not be in depression,"Hello all, first off I am really proud that this sub exists and helps so many people battle depression. Thank you for existing!

Recently I made friends with a colleague and we started texting quite frequently. In the beginning it was quite normal but as we eased into the friendship, I started getting a feeling that they are in depression or were in depression at a certain time. They joke about suicide and depression and stuff like that but never told anything explicitly. 

Our chats don't have much and they always kinda give one word responses and whatnot. I understand it might be that they are just busy or something. But since quite some days she is feeling a bit low. 

Now, as a friend what are some things I can do? We live in different cities so it's pretty much just texting back &amp; forth. I check on them from time to time, send memes &amp; wholesome stuff.. but just wanna know if there's anything else I can do in case they actually have/had depression. 

PS: I know I might be looking too much into the lines, extrapolating unnecessary conclusions and all but I didn't want to take a risk when it comes to this and I just wanna help out a mate!

Thank you for reading,
Cheers."

depression,How am I supposed to get better?,"I swear sometimes it feels like over the last decade of seeing psychs I have been diagnosed and tested for just about everything in the book as much fun as it is to know how many lovely little labels I have I'm still fucked (i don't know if I can swear in here I assume I can but I also get kids might be in here so I'm so sorry kids). Now I'm an adult, working full-time, completely unfulfilled, and can't afford to spend $100 a week so that a person sitting on the other end of a computer can tell me my feelings are valid or that they're sorry I went through x,y, or z. I cannot take another decade of paying through the nose to gain no results. The mantra of ""it gets better"" is so relative. Does it? Does it really? Is coping with the constant mental strain of the pit of loneliness and shame and self-hatred really ""getting better""? Is that a way to live the rest of my life? I shell out like 65% of my salary after taxes on rent because I live in a city so I can have a job and at this point, my options are food or therapy. I just don't know how I'm supposed to get better. I'm clearly venting here and once again I'm sorry I just feel like I'm out of options. It's not like mental illness is curable, it's like having internal herpes - yeah sometimes it flairs up and it's really bad and other times it's just kind of nagging in the back of your head but it's always there. The only difference is that this shit is rotting me from the inside out. I can't tell if I should be screaming or punching or crying or just numb at this point. But hey, my cat likes her new toy so that's something I guess."
depression,M19 - I’m only happy when I’m high,"I told myself that I’d stop smoking weed until I was an adult because I’m not fully developed. But recently I don’t even care about all that. I don’t see myself having any kind of future and I’m unsure about what I want to do with my life. Everyone else seems to be a step above me and I feel like an idiot all the time.

I’m almost 100% certain I have ADHD. I feel so slow and anxious having to do basic tasks and when I see other people around me completing them so effortlessly, it makes me feel like a complete failure. I want real human connections yet everyone around me feels so artificial.

I feel like I fuck up every social interaction I come into contact with. I’ve tried to work on my social skills for the longest time, but I always feel so slow and clouded. I’ve just began to give up recently and I’ve isolated myself. I sometimes wonder if other people can tell if I’m depressed.

I wonder if they actually care about me or like me as a person. Why would they though when everything that comes out of my mouth is idiotic even when it feels like I’m trying my best. I just have such a hard time relating to most people and I feel like I wasn’t made for this world.

I can’t stand the idea of going to school and working a job until the day I die when I already feel like I’m giving up at 19. People tell me that I’m super smart and that I have so much to live for but I have a hard time believing that. The only choices I have are to face reality and feel depressed or to smoke weed everyday.

Is it really healthy living like this though? I feel like being high gives me a break from reality and makes me much more optimistic about the future, yet once I come down I’m back to how I felt before. Those little breaks are so therapeutic to me though. Should I continue doing what I’m doing? I just don’t know anymore.."

depression,Lost everything. Literally going insane. Going to die.,"I've lost everything. I'm in a weird purgatory before suicide.
Everyone knows who I am but I have literally no friends. I can't talk to people. Occured to me after nearly two years that everyone in drumline thinks I'm annoying (drumline used to be one of my favorite activities). I found out that pretty much every hangout I've been to since 7th grade I was only invited out of pity by one ""friend"". Everyone there thought I was an annoying and I don't blame them. I never have and never will be in a relationship, I will likely never have friends for the rest of highschool seeing how much I've tried to socialize to no end. I look like a homo erectus so there's that as well. My grades dropped so hard and now my parents stripped away playing instruments which was the last thing that made life bearable. 

I'm living in spectator mode, watching all of the people that I thought were my friends (who actually hate me) move on with their lives, building new relationships, going out and doing things, etc. I used to be a really hyperactive kid because of bad ADHD and now I just wear my hood and sleep in class and not say a single word all day.

I'm so fucking lonely I've been full on talking to myself and having multiple hour conversations with people in my head I've never met. My mind is acting weird it's fucking terrifying. 

Only reason I'm here and not rotting in the earth somewhere is because I haven't found anything to overdose on (powerful sleeping pills would be fantastic). I don't want pain, just wanna go. Other thing I've thought about is just driving down an empty road at 2am with the pedal floored and just waiting until I hit something.

ive lost everything that makes me happy and in so lonely I think I'm going mentally insane and I want to die every minute of my life."
depression,"(CW: Suicide talk, brief mention of CSA/abuse) Nearing the end of my rope","This is gonna be another one of those long posts that’ll get maybe five views and two comments, but I don’t know how much I care. It’s not like I have many people in real life anyway (especially at 1 in the morning where I am right now), so might as well just put it all out here where someone might see all of it.

I’m a first-year college student in the U.S. and I just transferred to a new school for this semester because I liked the location more. Dorms were all full when I applied, so I moved into an apartment nearby with a roommate who I don’t really think likes me all that much. I kinda get the vibe that she’d prefer to keep things as a “peaceful coexistence” rather than any sort of friendship.

To put it lightly, making friends has also been rough. I have a couple (read: like four, i counted) people who I knew before, but half of them are in different states and everyone has their own life so it’s not a perfect solution. I’m not someone who’s super confident socially, so when I reach out to try and connect with someone it can be pretty nerve-wracking. Unfortunately, it feels like every time I reach out it just doesn’t go well or it only lasts a couple of days.

One example of this happened a couple of weeks ago, at my school’s athletic complex. I was at the climbing wall trying to meet people, and I met this group of three guys who I hung with for the night while we were all there. I was making good conversation and all that, and it felt like it was going super well so I asked for their Snapchats. One of them never added me back, one of them I haven’t reached out to, and I messaged the last person once and realized this evening that he unfriended me at some point so my message went unread. That stung.

The mountains have really been my happy place since I learned to ski a few seasons ago. There’s no place like it and, as someone who doesn’t feel like they belong anywhere, it’s the closest thing I’ve got to a place I could call home. But enough exposition. Last week I asked a lift operator for her Snapchat and (to my surprise) she gave it to me. However, it got to the point where I felt like I was carrying the conversation because I was initiating everything, she’d only reply like once or twice a day, and she’d only follow-up once among other things. So today I ran into her at the resort and waved, and she reacted as I would have to someone I’d never seen before. At that point I decided to just give up on it, because, while I’m lonely and therefore more than willing to pull the weight of two in a friendship, the rejection really set in and I couldn’t make up reasons for why I wasn’t being appreciated.

Finally, I went to a bar with a friend of mine (someone I knew previously) the other night and I was actually feeling super good when I got there, but that feeling soon faded after it hit me how alone I am and how I feel I don’t fit in. It’s like everyone my age who I see has a social circle, and then I’m just…there.

As a result, I’m starting to feel discouraged from trying to reach out because it almost never works out and I can save myself the sadness and disappointment. It’s the same reason why I never post polls or Q&amp;A’s on social media. Regardless of what I tell myself, trying to engage someone always gets my hopes up that they’ll engage back and I usually end up feeling let down. At this point I’m probably a few more rejections away from just giving up and isolating myself because it’s not worth trying.

Things have kind of sucked for as long as I can remember (traumatic childhood, abuse, molestation, family instability) and I’ve been passively suicidal for the past two years straight. It’s gotten slightly worse at times but tonight I really thought about it. I started drafting the letter and thinking about how I could do it, and I went for a walk to clear my head and (after some nicotine) I still didn’t feel great, but I didn’t feel unsafe anymore. I decided to reevaluate my plan of getting drunk because I just didn’t feel like it (and I have class in the morning anyway) and I didn’t feel the need to do it anymore, but I’m really losing here. I feel like there’s only so much more of this life I can take. I wish I was one of those “lone wolf” types (assuming they exist) who doesn’t need people, but that’s not who I am. I don’t know how much more of this I can take, because everyone tells me “it gets better” and I tried to believe it, but I just can’t anymore because things have gotten worse or stayed the same for so long. I mean having hope would be nice, but I’m just running out of things to feel hopeful about. I don’t know what to do and I’m at the point where I’m really starting to care if things get better, and instead just wanting to be done."

Sometimes while laying in bed I felt pity to myself because of the way I act and do stuff. I want to separate myself from the world but on the same time I want the comfort of others.

depression,This girl is poison,"My name is Kyle. I'm a 31 year old male virgin skinny and not that bad looking for a tall drink of water and I am absolutely crazy about a girl from work. So much so that she haunts my thoughts daily and has wormed her way into my psyche. 

The girl in question started working at my work last summer and my job being almost exclusively to men it was a nice change of pace. We were separated by shifts at the top me and I worked the night shift, so at the end of the day I would shoot the shit with her for a good 20 to 30 minutes. This became an addiction. It wasn't healthy for me, at this point in my life I have never had a girlfriend so having this interaction with the opposite sex was something of a new thing for me and was at the same time exhilarating. After a few weeks of talking I worked up the courage to give my number, which would never have happened if not for the encouragement of my coworkers. But I did just that.

 And she shot me down, we didn't talk for a week, I think it was due to the awkward exchange but we were cool a week later. At the time I didn't know about the boyfriend. She never once eluded to him. She was very flirty, and with me being the inexperienced welp that I am I fell for it.  It wasn't long after that when she finally casually mentioned the boyfriend and then I decided to stop trying to go for her, obviously cause she was taken and second this was becoming a huge problem on my end. 

I started to ween off her, a few min every day at the end of work nothing as long as before, until I stopped altogether. And that's when I started having withdrawals. She was on my mind before but when I took the break I couldn't shake her. Every though was her and it was absolutely mind melting. I wanted to break free of it so, my solution was to go back to what we was doing. And then she took of me that soon she would be working on my shift. I was both exhilarated and terrified of the thought. I loved talking with this girl we had so much in common it felt like a natural match but in my foolish attempt at trying to find love I fell into a web.

But now it's gotten even worse. It's so bad that my thoughts have gone from her to dark thoughts because I now know that she has no feelings for me. It took a long time to figure this out but this girl is naturally flirty, and does this with everyone. But I'm still positive what we have is special compared to the rest. I dwell on this girl daily but it's not just her now. Thoughts of death and other things find there way into my mind as well  

All because I'm too big of a coward to admit my fellings or stand up for myself when the time arrives.

When she started we sat together every day at break time but now she opts to break by herself, what the hell? I never once eluded to get that I want anything romantic with her, I probably should have but I never did, and now I get this. I loved sitting with her, talking about nerdy stuff like anime and manga but now I feel so isolated. Not just from her but everyone and everything. Life doesn't feel the same anymore. 

I've always been a coward, I never talked to girls due to fear if rejection and I'm just terrible at coming up with conversation and I want more than anything to get away from anything that has to do with her. Should I quit my job? Surely that would help but I've been here almost 5 years, I don't know anymore.

 like a magnet, I'm drawn to her."

I can literally feel my soul filled with humiliation and embarrassment. I feel like my life ended the day I hit my head. I’m over this shit I just don’t know where else to go.

So my recent schools of thoughts are either not-totally reclusing myself: get a new phone and remain in contact w some close ppl, aside from my family. Or just commit suicide, cos I definitely can’t see a different path in the future.

My way of doing things and how I am is different, and how those friendships were broken/strained was because of my differences. And I can’t keep being me and keep forming &amp; breaking new friendships….

depression,Day 1: The outbreak of war,"Yesterday I hit one of life's lows, today the counterattack commences. 

I slept very little last night but today I must try and fight back. 

I've started with the hardest part, I got out of bed. I showered, shaved and dressed, and that brings us to now. Not much of achievement, but a start. 

Plans for today. 

1. Have a small, healthy breakfast. 

2. Walk to the local clothing store, I need some running trainers, budget ones will do for a start. 

3. Potentially get a haircut, we'll see how busy it is and it's not a pressing need, but a step worth taking if I don't have to wait around for long.

4. Go to the supermarket. I'll need some healthy food and snacks, I will resist temptation and choose wisely. Some juice for the morning, fruit, granary bread, wraps and tune will be a start.

5. My son's stays at his grandparents tonight which, coincidentally, is also my temporary home. They have my old Lego, so I'm going to try and get the right side of the brain working and build him something before he comes home from school. 

Hold me to account for my actions."
depression,Over the last two years I have become really unmotivated in my education and life and I think it is due to depression,"To give a bit of background, I was really studious and I used to find studying fun. I used to enjoy the thrill of topping a test or getting compliments for my intelligence ever since I was a kid. 
That was until year 11 and 12 when I started to not do as good in tests and people I used to beat where now beating me in the same tests. Not to sound so egotistical but beating people in tests was one of my motivations and when all of sudden, when I stopped doing so I started to have feelings of self doubt that I was dumb and the only reason I did good academically was because everyone wasn't trying. The fact that year 11 and 12 (in Australia) are also vital to getting into a good university gave me more anxiety and dread that I never had before. Despite trying my best, I could never get the same ""high"" that I used to and I lost motivation to study and no matter how hard I tried, it was dissapointing result after dissapointing result. I asked my parents (who are Indian) but this led to more self doubt as they would give the same advice of "" You arent trying hard enough"" or ""You are playing too many video games"" despite it being at the peak of lockdown (mid 2020) and playing video games was a way for me to cope with the stress of school. 
Year 12 wasnt any better as I had done poorly on a test called the UCAT which was vital for me to get into my dream job of medicine and my school results werent any better than the previous year and my motivation for studying dropped even more and I started coming up with excuses that the teachers don't like as a coping mechanism but deep down, I had even more doubts about my abilities and my intelligence. 
Despite year 12 ending, I still have this feeling of self doubt and it has been made worse by not getting into any medical school, something that I thought was an attainable goal. While I do still have a course at uni which allows me to still pursue my dreams of becoming a doctor, I have immense dread when I think of starting my course and have feeling of never getting my goals no matter how hard I try.
Any ideas on how to get over this feeling of dread, anxiety and lack of motivation would help as I would like to regain the same motivation I had for life  and education that I had once before.

P.S sorry for such a long rant but I feel like a burden has been left of my chest. Sorry for any bad grammar as I typed this on my phone."
depression,I feel okay but empty (non native english),"Idk how to describe it maybe you know from just the title.

I really feel okay, still depressed from time to time, but not that lethargic or energy-less(?) anymore. I can get up in the morning for work, shower, keep my room kinda clean (cleaning at least once a week). I finally found friends that take me like I am. But still somethings missing and idk what.

Since my depression comes from repressed feelings and past unrequited love (i think but i aint sure) maybe the lack of a romantic binding causes me to feel like this. I mean my depression not only comes from these two things, it still makes a small amount of sense to me.

I have hobbies, daily social contacts, work and therefore income. But i still feel like thats not enough. Like if you drew a picture and can't finish it bc you don't know what to add but it feels unfinished.

And idk i really want to make something out of my life but i can't figure out what to do/become. My lack of interest in many things just hold me back from achieving goals. Like my job is good, but i don't like it and still any interest that I have won't ever create enough income to live if i would do it as a job.

Can somebody maybe help me figuring out what is missing in my Life?"

""You are loved"", ""People care about you"" great, thanks but those words are not going to stop the thoughts in my head, they aren't going to lift the fog and make everything brighter. Words are meaningless without action to back them up.

Don't tell me what you think I want to hear, in fact the only words that help are ""*how are you*"" but asked with a genuine sincerity and then listen, just listen. Don't judge, don't comment, don't try to come up with words to make me feel better, or suggestions on how I can sort my life out. Just listen and give me a hug. That's it.

I want someone to show me that they have taken time out from their day, their problems to sit with me and devote their time to me to just simply listen. Even if I have nothing to say."
depression,i feel like i always need more help than is available,"i should probably go to a psych ward, but i don't have health insurance, plus the pandemic. i should probably reach out to people who I'm positive love and care about me, but they're all busy juggling an increasing number of balls, and there's only so many hours in a day. i need someone to walk me through getting a job, but i'm 24 and expected to know how to be a normal person, there's nowhere i can go where someone will give me that kind of attention. i only see a therapist once every two weeks on average, enough time for me to fit in two nervous breakdowns.

everyone's hands are tied, and i'm slipping through the cracks. how can i not feel like a lost cause? i know 24 is still young, but not that young. and i dont know if i've got a lot of future left either way. there's just nothing in my life i can rely on to be there to help, anything could be taken away due to covid or time constraints or unaffordability or just bad luck. i haven't wanted to hurt myself this badly in a while."
depression,I cannot expect people to love me,"I cannot expect people to care for me. I cannot expect people to love me. But I can still attempt to help myself to love myself and with that, love other people as well even if it is one-sided.

Maybe that is why I am still trying to improve myself today and hopefully the days after too. Living is so so so painful. I really cannot bear the thought of someone else suffering, whether it is from depression or something else. But my ability is extremely limited; I will be satisfied if my potentially healthier future self can lighten the burden of someone, even if it is just one person.

I am an awful person. Maybe this is me trying to make myself appear noble. I am a horrible person.

Life sucks, and it will probably still be even if I appear to be moving forward. I do not have any expectations any more. What will be, will be.

Even if it is all for nothing, at least I can say to my miserable self that I tried.

I really feel awful right now and it will likely stay that way for a long time; but for those reading and not reading this, I wish you all the best."
depression,Thoughts,"Having some dark thoughs lying in bed, in pain and trying to sleep."
depression,I just wish I could just turn my life off,"I am 22 when I was 18 I had a huge car accident that I almost lose my life at. I felt helpless I had no friends, couldnt sleep for over a month and whenever I sleep I just dream about driving a car to an accident with no brakes. 

I recovered and went to GYM and made new friends felt like they are close to me, but it’s just fake. They only like me when I am supporting them, but they really never asked about how I am doing. When I looked at them treating me it was just their benifits.

I fell inlove with a really lovely girl 2 years ago. She made me feel like I am a special person. She was the only one to know and feel when I am sad I really loved her I was excited everytime we meet, but she was just having fun she was faking or actually having benifits from me having a car, also used me to be protected from others. Plus she cheated on me with some other handsome guy.

I don’t know how to express my feelings anymore I have got no one to talk to. My memory is becoming too short. When I talk to people I might repeat the same word 2 or 3 times like my brain is lagging. My body went from 80kg with a good muscle shape to 60kg. I dont have feelings for anyone anymore I have tried to love but I just dont feel anything anymore I just wanna shutdown. I have been a smoker for 2 years now it helped me at the start to forget about thinking but now it doesnt. I just had another car crash today not a big deal not my fault its a minor but probably I will pay for fixing it althought I am working a job that pays shit. 

I have tried to recover, but its impossible. I just skip my days playing games or watching some series hoping nothing bad happens but surely happens anyway..
I dont want to suicide, but I just want peace til I die. Not hoping for things to happen but the opposite."
depression,Don't think therapy or meds can help me at this point,"i'm just talking to myself here but damn i'm too damaged. 

i'm just waiting for one thing to happen and then i'm out. i don't even get sad or anxious about kms anymore. it feels natural. like it's meant to be and i'm okay with it. 

people tell me to search for help but what would help even do besides forcing me to live......."
depression,Considering ECT（ o_o）,I've run out of options. Idk what to do buy I'm getting worse. Medicaid soukdng even pay for it would they? What does it even do? Any positive stories of experience here?
depression,I’m so tired of existing just to pay stupid bills that will never bring me any kind of happiness except pure misery,"Like I’m just so sick and tired of having to go to work everyday and still have nothing and be poor and constantly have to worry about having more money so I can continue to pay bills so I can survive this awful miserable fucking life I never asked for. 

No wonder people kill themselves. I don’t want to continue with this life anymore. Not even a little bit. I wish I had the balls to end it. It’s the only way out"
depression,I don’t see a point in living,"I hate myself. I’ve hated myself ever since I was a kid. My parents used to say, “you’re stupid so you have to study twice as hard as everyone else” or “don’t even try, it’s a waste of time”. They also constantly compared me with my cousins or friends on how they were smarter and had better manners than me. I gradually started to think that I was a problem for my parents and started to hate myself for it. Fast forward many years later (27 yo), I still hate myself and I have absolutely no confidence in doing anything. I have no skills, no work experience, no job, no friends, no money…what the point of living when I can’t even fit into society and I have nothing to offer? Why can’t people just let you die? There’s been so many nights where I wish I didn’t exist or build up the courage to just end this miserable life. I’ve been feeling miserable ever since I was a kid so don’t give me the “life will get better” bs. I’ve been suffering for 20+ years and it’s never gotten any better."
depression,Can’t stop ruminating about my past,"My depression got diagnosed when I started university (2016).I struggled so much to get treatment. It didn’t get better. I got kicked out of my dream school in 2020.  It killed all my dreams. I always wanted to stay in academics. I was so involved on campus too. Now I have nothing. 

Today I came upon my transcript of my grades in first year and never realized how great I actually did despite all my mental health problems and this made me spiral. I can’t stop thinking what I could’ve been if I wasn’t stuck with this illness. I could’ve been in med school right now. I could’ve been in grad school. It’s so hard because my parents are immigrants too and I’m the first born. 

How do I get over this? I’m sobbing right now and this rumination of what could’ve been keeps coming up especially with my birthday coming up."
depression,Is it normal to feel this?! (Depression symptoms),"It is not the regular headache I felt before and that is considered normal، I don't know to to explain it, but I've been feeling this since my depression got worse, it it's an annoying feeling, it like permanent pressure even after waking up. (I'm not taking any medication.)."
depression,Im so close to killing myself,Without meds im going to do it in 1 month
depression,I’m just so sick of needing to feel loved but being incapable of it,"It’s fucking awful, it’s like being massively dehydrated but you can’t physically swallow water. It’s like there’s just this block in some part of my brain, whatever wiring is necessary for human connection and feeling loved at all is just non-existent in my head. It’s fucking awful.

It’s like I have the most socially avoidant personality imaginable, I hate most people, and when I happen to find ones I can halfway tolerate I just can’t handle knowing them for too long or them knowing anything about me and the feeling is so pervasive after a while that I need to just move away and ghost everyone I’ve met. And the one and only time I’ve ever met someone that didn’t happen with, who I actually wanted to keep in my life, she fucking left because I was too much because of course I fucking was because I have no idea how to deal with this shit. Just having her show me a shred of decency threw all my feelings all over the fucking place, eventually led to me developing romantic feeling for her that I knew weren’t reciprocated, which only made me spiral even further until I was just a fucking incoherent mess of self-harm, suicide attempts, alcoholism and drug use. And so yeah, of course when she eventually found out about my feelings she left, cause it was the final nail in a fucking coffin absolutely full of them. 

I’ve tried doing the whole “love yourself first” thing too, but I fucking can not. I just can’t do it. This is where that mental block comes in that disallows me from feeling loved, I just can’t feel that feeling. I’ve been to 3+ years of therapy, been on every medication under the fucking sun, tried all the mediation techniques and “positive self-talk” shit but it doesn’t matter what I do or how long I do it for, I can’t love or feel loved by myself. 

It’s fucked. I’m in this constant tug of war with needing to just be held for a while, but also not wanting to be touched and not even wanting anyone to know enough about me to know that’s what I need. I just wanna get hit by a fucking truck or something."
depression,Guys HELPPPP I FEEL STUPID TODAY,"I got a bad grade but not failed I got a 2:00 grade for my two subject is it bad or its ok????

Plsss... someone help me... and tell me if its ok to got 2:00 from  my two subjectssss 😭😭

I got no one to talk about it...."
depression,Needed to get something off my chest,"I can't talk to anyone about this because my family refuses to acknowledge it and basically forbid me from talking to anyone outside of the family about it. So I just wanna tell someone.

My oldest brother hung himself on December 1st.

I haven't seen him in person since I was 6 (I'm 20 now) and I haven't spoken to him since June 2020. There's a lot of issues with our family's past, but long story short he ran away and was basically cut out of the family. I wasn't close to him, in fact I hardly knew him. But it still hurts.

When the rest of my family found out, they immediately dropped it and wouldn't talk about it. I think I'm the only one really grieving and it fucking sucks, y'know? I hate showing those kind of emotions to people, but I hate being forced to grieve alone again.

Anyway, um, life sucks and I can't wait to die. Thanks for letting me tell you about my brother. It's nice to finally tell someone."
depression,Guess I can't even sleep without fucking something up,"I was just woken up at four this morning and snapped at because I mostly slept through the night, guess I shouldn't have worn my cpap, while not getting up to check on the cats we had gotten spayed. I figured that since the other person had the day off it would have been no issue. I was wrong and was talked down to for getting more sleep then them. And it was wrong of me to only need to get up once for the bathroom. I am trying to make up for it by sitting in the room with the girls, contemplating on just laying on the floor next to them if I am still tired.

Love that even small things like using a machine that is supposed to make sure I sleep through the night are wrong because of some conceived belief that I am inconveniencing other people. Not surprised with that since I am always told I don't do enough."
depression,Just cry and cry as much as you can as a cheap therapy,"I have read a lot of these post and can relate. I periodically (months apart) watch sad scenes or think about sad things to just let it all out; like letting a flood gate open up. I am also aware some people cannot physically cry because of up bringing or something else. I recommend screaming for them or punching an inanimate object that will not cost $ or damage to anyone else. The point is let it out. In our society we are expected to be okay always. I am asked by family and clients how I am on a daily basis as more as a quick acknowledgement and as you and everyone who has little time and must keep up appearances will say is ""I fine"" when it's farthest from the truth. I usually build up anger/upset/sadness and of course you cannot display how you feel in public, at work or in front of your family and loved ones so you keep it inside because you have to take care of business. But if it builds up too much and you are like me you start feeling tired. Not physically tired but emotionally. Like all that pain and sorrow is something you are carrying around and it stacks up. Eventually I start not liking waking up and the joys I once had are not enough or matter little. I don't want to die or cause harm to myself or others but I just want to sleep and never wake up. If this continues for long then the real bad thoughts occur. ""How do I end it to be the least burdensome on my family, I can make it look like an accident maybe so they still get insurance $"". Those kind of thoughts. I just had a crying session last night and feel much better this morning. I do hope this helps someone with little time and little $ to ease their emotional pain and burdens. I also am a man and in our culture like many others crying is seen as a sign of weakness. I sucks I cannot be angry and you should never take out your anger on anyone. But you can't also be sad either in society either. What's left to do but become depressed and make it worse the longer you hold it in. Take care everyone and as you see from this post and many others you are not alone. Do your best to keep charging forward and know that it's hard at times."

No watching together or FaceTime.

But just something to look forward to at the end of each day that keeps me kinda connected to my mom. Plus I’m a big fan of trivia like games.

PARENTHESIS

&amp;#x200B;

So here it is, last year (I was 24) during the pandemic, the whole planet was in lockdown undergoing several restrictions. During this period I was training as a web developer. Due to the pandemic, the courses were online. This means that from September 2020 to April 2021, from 9am to 5pm, I was behind my computer. And as the courses were mostly in winter, at 5pm it was already dark. So for 3 months I didn't see much daylight. Added to that I didn't sleep much and I ate anything, it was really a bad lifestyle. 

I didn't really like it but I told myself that it's not the end of the world because in April I would be free.

&amp;#x200B;

During this period I was talking a lot with a long time female friend who I fell in love with. It was comforting to talk with her during this shitty situation. 

All this time I was telling myself that in April it will all be over. 

The end of my training.

The beginning of good weather and sunshine.

The easing of health restrictions.

And at the same time, I wanted to reveal my feelings to my friend. 

I thought April 2021 would be a cathartic moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

And then, April came and as expected, two days after the end of my training, I finally opened up to her but unfortunately it didn't end the way I would have liked.  I expected that there was a possibility that the answer would be negative. But I didn't expect the reality. I didn't know it would hurt this much. It wasn't so much the answer that hurt me because she answered me in a very nice way but it was this feeling that it would be impossible to have a future with her. This thought made me understand that in life we don't have everything we have. I really couldn't forget her.

And that's not all, after more than 6 months of living like a hermit, going out and socializing became difficult for me because I had this impression that I had changed in the meantime (physically). 

&amp;#x200B;

So all this to say that I thought I was ""immortal and invincible"" and I realized that we don't have everything we want and that when we get older, we can't go back.

&amp;#x200B;

With time, I learned little by little to accept that (even if it remains difficult) and I think I feel better than 7 months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know why I explained myself so long for something that doesn't have a direct link with my subject haha.

After my depression I noticed that there were physical consequences related to my depression. Dark circle, some wrinkles, .... I also have a very sad face. And overall I wanted to know if it is possible to remedy these problems or do I have to accept and move on?

And if anyone has ever been able to reverse this, please tell me how you did it and if possible share a before and after picture.

Is it possible to go back again to  a healthy looking and happy face ?

depression,I just want to go home,"Ever since I was 10 years old I've been living in another country that I dislike, now I'm almost 21 and I'm still in this place rotting away, the only reason I haven't gotten out of the country is because I wouldn't be able to afford going to college if I left this country but everyday I feel more tired, lonelier and just messed up in the head I have practically no cash neither does my family the only reason I can go to college is because I got a scholarship so I feel very fortunate but I'm just really goddammit tired of everything and everyone its gotten to the pont that I can't think straight at all not even for the easiest things and I'm struggling with college because of it, but I don't want to struggle with college because the longer I struggle the more time I'm going to have to spend in this hellwhole, I'm sorry if I sound unappreciative but I'm just so tired"
depression,Citalopram - Thoughts?,"Hey there,

I'm currently going through somewhat of a tough time. I feel anxious quite a lot of the time, wondering always the worst-case scenario, if someone would do something to me, and always seeking reassurance about things. Also going through a tough time with a number of things in life which has all come at me at once which I do not want to go into detail about.

Anyways, I spoke to a doctor today (my GP sucks in my opinion, even the convo with the doctor today I got the vibe she didn't know much about citalopram), but she prescribed it to me. I was on it previously, but I can't remember the exact experience I had except it killed my sex drive.

I am now here a few years on, more anxious, more worried, and I am just curious as to your thoughts about Citalopram? I see it can cause permanent sexual dysfunction? She prescribed me 20mg to start with and I am nervous about starting it. I would say my anxiety is really bad, but my mood is medium - I can still joke around and be okay. I also take anti-histamines for sleep - which I do not want to be on. Would this help? And that also reminds me, does citalopram cause memory problems/dementia?

Just wanted your thoughts and experiences on this?"
depression,I need to turn my life around but I don't know how...,"I (24m) have been struggling with depression/depressive thoughts for the past few years.

I know it's not healthy to be like this and I need to turn my life around but god dammit everything including prolonged happiness just seems so difficult.

depression,I overheard my housemates talk shit about me yesterday night.,"Don’t really know where to begin. When a visiting friend of mine left I heard two housemates in my kitchen saying all sorts of things about me. My breath smells (which was by far the worst because I’ve been paranoid about this for a year and been trying to work on my dental hygiene), I talk about myself too much, agree too much, look away from eye contact strangely (I’m just worried about my eyes wandering especially if someone’s wearing something revealing. I didn’t want to make them uncomfortable but I guess not), laugh weird, talk weird... these are two housemates I thought I’d got along with but they were speaking at such a volume late last night there was no way I was the only one that heard them.

At first I was glad for the criticism because I want to make people happy, knowing where to start is a good idea. But as I thought about how many things I’ve done that are worthless and hated by people without me even realising, I just started to hyperventilate. I’m not sure for how long, it felt like 15-30 minutes of me purely panicking. I’m pretty sure people heard that through the walls too. I eventually stopped and went to bed but woke up this morning with no intention of interacting with any of my housemates (there are 18). I’d rather go the rest of the uni year saying nothing to anyone than ever finding out that people thought of me like that again. I feel so fucking worthless. I don’t know if I’d call myself a good person but I wanted to be kind, considerate, at least friendly. Turns out I’d been a joke this whole time."

The pain is something that you can try your best to burry and forget about, but it will always crawl back out and makes its into your heart just to strangle it again.

Going to church doesn't help. Talking to friends doesn't help. This pain is a sleeping cancer waiting patiently to claim its prize. Every day I hold the tears back from my mother. She doesn't know how broken her son is. It feels like I'm living on autopilot; using nothing more than basic motor functions to get through the day. I have a heavy heart. I resist an easy fix  like alcohol yet its so tempting, but I know it'll just make the pain worse. Some of us are just meant to suffer and I'm one of them. Thats fine because I get it now."
depression,2-year resume gap is stressing me out.," Not sure if this is the sub for this, but as the title says, I’m a few years out of high school, and was working a minimum wage restaurant job when covid hit. 

Obviously I was then out of work. I took several months off, and was initially planning on working at a family business that was set to open in a few months. This continually got pushed back as it usually does, and I didn’t look for another job in the meantime for fear I’d only end up working there a few weeks. 

This earnest desire to get back to work eventually turned to gratefulness at been given an “out” to the jobs I’d been working for the last 5 years, and an opportunity to recognize how miserable they made me - mixed with extreme anxiety about the obvious need to get a job, and my inability to explain my two-year resume gap or what I’ve been doing since the pandemic. 

I’ve been living at home, and while I feel having the luxury to take so much time off was good for me mentally,  I have nothing to show for my time. I haven’t done any school, any volunteering, no industry-related courses I could really take as I was working minimum wage. I’ve been doing nothing. 

I need to move out, and move on with my life, but I feel trapped. A return to menial work, if they’d have me, is kind of a waste of my extremely long period of reflection and self-actualization. But I have no qualifications to do anything else. And I don’t know how any job recruiter in any field would want to hire someone like me. 

More years of my life that I just completely wasted, I have no discernible direction to go in, and the amount of uncertainty is just exacerbating my anxiety and my inability to move forward. 
No clue what to do."

depression,Need help opening up to my therapist,"Sounds ridiculous but, how do i open up more to my therapist? Ive had to deal with mental health problems for easily 10+ years now that i have become numb to it. There's certain periods where i can feel myself going into a mental breakdown. I feel like crying for no reason, i become unstable emotionally but i suppress all that. When im passed that stage i completely forget about it, to the point where i have no memory of it ever occurring. So when i do see my therapist, they mention im doing an amazing job and that im becoming better. When in reality i know im not making any progress. 

Most of these issues i experience happen at night as i relax for bed and by morning i have no memory of ever feeling like that. 

Im only mentioning it now since im going through that phase again."
depression,Now what," Today my dad indirectly told me he's ashamed of me, and He called me blur ( like the slow learner/ to catch up kind of boy). I thought when other people ridicule me like this my family will be the one to back me up. Feels Good to be alive man .  
5 years in high school , everyone call me ugly and blur. of course my closest friends like 2 people gonna be like  no you're not ugly. Of course they'll say that in front of me. Man If schoolmate and university mate be like this I maybe can go to my family right, but if my family call me this, what should I do now.  


They'll gonna be like if you face any problem just tell us. How the fuck am I supposed to even trust you. You're the same as them. and now I feel empty , It's too empty that I can't even cry to relief my misery anymore"
depression,Should i take lorazepam?,"Last year I had a major breakdown with panic attacks and got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I was on sick leave for a couple of weeks and quit my job as I was very unhappy with my situation. I also got a lorazepam prescription from my Doctor but never took it because I know it is an addictive benzodiazepine and I'm afraid that I will quickly get addicted to it as I already am addicted to weed. 

After quitting my job I began feeling a lot better, seems like my anxiety is somehow tied to work. 

I work in my new job for about 4 months now and the panic attacks and anxiety are coming back since early January. 

I can't get my work done and I'm feeling this permanent feeling of fear all day which paralyzes me, I sit on my desk all day while browsing reddit (I'm also at work right now -.-) and in the evening i feel exhausted, tired and hate myself that i again didn't get anything done. 

I still have the lorazepam package unopened and I don't know if i should take it now. Has anyone here experience with the medication? How long does it take to get addicted and does it even help with this kind of symptoms? 

I'm not in therapy yet but want to do this soon. For now I just need some quick cure so I can at least do my work again. 

Throwaway account because I'm not yet comfortable to talk open/public about my depression."
depression,How do I cope with life and the loss of childhood?,"I am severely depressed. I have been for a long, long time. I am 16 right now, and I have felt this way intermittently since I was 9. Usually I manage to pull myself together after a few months, but I have been in a steady downwards spiral since 2020. Since then, I have had to medically withdraw from school twice, once in 2021 and now this year. In the past I faced a lot of problems with rumination and regret, but now I am struggling immensely with motivation, purpose, and hope. I fail to see the point of life. I hate the idea of this constant cycle of falling down and building yourself up again, only to fall harder and harder every time. I am so tired of trying harder, and harder, and harder only to wind up right back where I started. After my last breakdown in 2020, I thought I was over it for good. And yet here I am, waiting for a psychiatric visit. This problem has also been made worse by chronic stomach pain I am experiencing, making every day a struggle.

I have tried all of the coping mechanisms. My mother, who is amazing, has done all she could for me to get better. I have tried counselors, multiple medications, and like I said has even pulled me from school to do online so I could focus more on mental health. She has even set up jobs for me. That is one of the main reasons it hurts so bad when I fall back to square one. I can tell I stress her horribly and I feel like a disappointment. I also find myself exaggerating in a lot of ways to her, because it keeps me from going back to doing things like school where I feel horrible and sick. I also, even though this disgusts me, exaggerate in part for extra attention. I know she does not think I put enough effort into getting myself better, but I can't explain that I can barely put effort into living in general, let alone being healthy and getting my shit together.  

I am also struggling hard with my childhood. In a lot of ways, I feel robbed of it and all I want is to go back. I remember being happy and carefree. My family was connected and we were happy together. Now some of us do not even interact and everything is different and shitty. I miss it so so so much. I don't wanna grow up, the thought of it makes me sick. I know I am looking through rose-tinted glasses, but I don't care. Anything is better than whatever the fuck my life is now.

Overall, I just don't know what to do anymore. I keep falling down over and over again, and harder and harder than previously. Nothing I do changes it, and even my temporary relief is becoming shorter and shorter. In a lot of ways, I do not even see the point in getting better. A huge part of me just wants to give up and be done with it. I don't fucking know anymore man."
depression,Working from home feels like a prison sentence,"Is anyone else out there in a similar situation or has advice on what I can do? I've been working from home for the past 2 years during the pandemic. My company has effectively shut down all locations and asked us all to work remotely. It's been a rolling policy, extended by several months each time it's been up for review. I can't handle it. I'm stuck at home all day, every day. I miss the day-to-day interaction with the people I work with. I miss seeing different people on a daily basis. I miss going out and the spontaneity of it all. I'm married with 2 teenage children and they are pretty much the only people I see. I have a small social circle and no siblings or other family. I have no meaningful conversations with others. I've joined a few meet up groups and started an evening class to get me out the house but none of that has helped. There's something missing. I greatly envy others I meet who aren't working from home, even those on hybrid working arrangements. At least they get to go out, do their job and interact with others. I feel so lonely and trapped. But hey, I'm glad to have a job, a family and a home. I know others aren't so lucky. But this is really getting to me now."
depression,was going to post in r/marriageadvice but this really belongs here,"So my spouse took cat #1 of 3 to the vet. Cat number two wandered into the pet carrier after they got home, and now cat #3 will just hiss and harass cat #2 for whatever crazy cat reason. They're best buds but for now now it's crazy. (fwiw, cats 1 &amp; 3 have always just mostly ignored each other and 2+3 are peas in a pod). In the last 18 hours my spouse has taken it really hard. She's had the most pessimistic outlook on the situation, saying  stuff like ""their friendship is ruined, they'll never get along again. She should have put the cat carrier in the garage right away."" etc. She's super-extra down on herself for a situation that quite literally not her fault and due to crazy cat logic. She's separated them, scruffing the aggressor cat (#2), locking it in a room overnight. Just basically surprising me with how physical she's getting with this cat - who is far and away her favorite. It's almost like watching someone self harm themselves.

I know she goes down these sneaky self-hate spirals and I try to be supportive and patient. Today I'm having a really hard time being a supportive spouse. My ~~knee~~\-jerk reaction is to tell her I don't care and I'm sick of her loathing. With everything going on in the world, her ""little self-obsessed breakdown"" is just hitting me completely wrong, and I have thoughts that I know are wrong and completely not compassionate. + It's harder because we don't really have any local friends anymore and because she works at a hospital and is completely stressed out with covid she doesn't want to go out and do anything either. I'm basically her support network the past 2 years. I'm sure she's just as tired of it as I am.

I don't want to feel that, though. It's wrong. I *want* to be supportive.

I'm thinking of taking her for a drive when i get home from work to get her out the house. I can't change her mind, I know, but I can remove her from the situation at least. Aw crap, it's supposed to to start snowing tonight. Maybe not.

Any ideas? Thanks for letting me vent.

btw, the cats are safe and no one is being physically harmed."

depression,"22M, out of college, very much want this to end","Broke up with my college girlfriend back in August and I have been blocked off for about 3 months now. From hindsight I was gaslighted during my relationship when my ex would blame me for the reason why she had to abort our accidental child. I “manipulated” her into getting the procedure. In especially the month of October I pretty much felt dead inside and I would literally visualize like her, a makeshift child, and myself. It was fucking horrible. Afterwards I was dealing with obsessive thoughts about my jealousy on what she was doing and if she was moving on and whatever. It fucking sucks because I work a sales job so at the same time I’m forced to act joyous and happy in the day time when internally I genuinely want to end it all. Hearing my housemates have sex literally reminds me if my ex is having sex with someone else. If I walk past by a couple or if I see a food place we went to, I immediately think about my ex like instantly. The topic of sex, intimacy, or coupling just makes me so jealous and sad. If I find casual sex with a girl, I immediately feel empty right after and think about what my ex is doing. I’ve been working out so much and I’ve been looking a lot better and I go out in the day and I smile like everything is okay. My friends knew I was depressed before but now they think it’s all alright. In reality I genuinely want to die. Sorry this was a long rant. I hate the lifestyle my housemates live of just hooking up and partying. I’m over that now I wanna do real stuff. Point is I’m very very lonely I just want a hug man, I wanna stop having an unhealthy relationship with sex and jealousy feelings, work is getting stressful because I need to hit my Quota, I’m just so annoyed and tired all the time. The only time I’m happy is in the gym. God I hope this will pass, feeling like this since august and it’s gotten worse every month.

I get it. Just be patient. But you can reply within a second of them texting you, so you know they're on the phone, and still nothing. You hang out and see them on their phone the whole time.

depression,When will it get better,"Everyday is a struggle. There isn’t a single day in my life where I haven’t been stressed or worried or enjoy life.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, OCD, CPTSD, Social Anxiety, and depression.

It started off with me being diagnosed with ADHD and I luckily found success with medication. 

But then once I started college I just became a mess. Which is when recently I was diagnosed with everything mentioned aside from ADHD.

Everyday I struggle to keep my BPD thoughts from impacting me. I’m always getting mad at my friends who only care about me. They don’t have anything against me, it is just all in my head. 

I don’t understand what I did to deserve this life. 

My parents are also narcissistic so that’s adds on top of the problems I’m dealing with.

I don’t have the energy to vent anymore. I’m just tired of life. I don’t see it getting any better. I can’t even get therapy because my parents control everything in my life. 

I tried recently to explain to my parents how I went behind their backs and got diagnosed. But they didn’t even care and got mad at me. 

After this I’ve just been feeling very hopeless towards life. Nothing is enjoyable. I can only get irritated. Im only hurting those who care about me. I’m only here because I’m scared to end it all."

depression,Life has become overwhelming,Probably the worst year on record. For one my drinking was getting out of hand. It started to scare me so I basically stopped cold turkey. I was feeling something was seriously off about my body. I started to arrange heart check ups. (Turns out things are probably ok). I’m overweight and smoke weed so I was super concerned. I was feeling and impending sense of doom. Odd thing was maybe it wasn’t about me. My mom called me randomly one night to tell me my cousin had died. He killed himself unfortunately. He was like a big brother to me. My family is really close because of my grandma in some ways. Thing was she was on her deathbed pretty much when my cousin died. We didn’t really realize at the time. She died a week later. We didn’t tell her about my cousin. But my family had to watch her die basically with the knowledge that her grandson was dead. 2 wakes. 2 funerals. 2 celebrations of life. I wanna drink to numb that pain. I barely can. You can say I’ve relapsed maybe but not really. I smoke so much weed as well. Maybe what I’m feeling in my chest is my lungs actually. Which sucks too since I should probably look into that. I’m also a musician. Struggling no doubt. I recently got a manger and things are usually fine but sometimes he hurts my feelings. I let him know that today and he took it badly. I thought it would be good for me to say some of these things. I said I feel like sometimes he doesn’t have my back and I think that was a big deal. I think he might quit which would f’ing suck. His dad passed away earlier this year. I think we’re both emotionally f’ed up. I don’t want him to quit. It’d be the cherry on top to the worst year of my life. Not to mention my awful love life. That’s a whole other story but basically this girl that I thought I’d finally get together with ghosted me and moved away and found a new boyfriend the first week she moved away. She texts me from time to time which also sucks because I just wanna tell her how she f’ed me up. Family life is messed up. Love life sucks. Im afraid my manager will quit. Feels like my musics career is going nowhere. Beer/weed is an issue. I also just turned 30 which kinda sucks too. Feels like my life is coming crashing down. Feels like life is winding down too. I already had issues prior to all this and it feels like my issues have just been exasperated by all this. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Fell out with one, she constantly said I wasn't someone she wanted to be seen with. No one else batted an eye, decided to drop all of them the same. 

Everyone else thinks I'm weird and doesn't like me. The only friend I have never takes my side and is super close to everyone who treated me like shit.

I'm in my fourth friend group over the year after having to move for one reason or the other and I'm just fucking sick of it. Sick of everyone.

I hate this stupid town and all these stupid fucking people.

Things with my family still suck and I wouldn't have it any other way.

I just want to leave but I feel so FUCKING TRAPPED. bgioebaoosadnoiansddddddddddddddddddddddoafiaf

Of course we are born with our parents or some form of guardianship. But that’s not an option for me anymore. I am 22. Mum died when I was 17. Dad is alive but old (for having a daughter as young as me) and not there emotionally, or physically due to various reasons.. so it’s like he’s not around. 
I just want to feel some sort of stability in my life.

depression,Question about staying up late,[removed]
depression,when is it selfless and not selfish?,"for a long time, i’ve reflected on my decisions, on others, and just the natural course of my life based on everyone around me.

ive been told i’m a selfless person who simultaneously receives criticism on being selfish. so which one is it? 

i know i can’t please everyone; being a people pleaser might even be one of my red flags. but if that’s the case, then when should i know to do things for my own benefit? 

i know for my own personal health and mental state, cutting ties or minimizing the relationship i have with my family would not only improve my quality of life, but theirs in the long run too. knowing this, however, has always posed so many moral and ethical questions. who am i to make that decision for them? am i being ungrateful for everything they’ve done to support me? shouldn’t i put myself first since it’s my life? isn’t it my choice to do this especially after everything i feel as if i’ve sacrificed and have done for them? 

it’s so hard to be perfect. my parents have always told me i have all the excuses in the world, but why is it i am capable of holding myself accountable and be the one to say sorry? why is it that their traditional views on parenting can’t coexist with american modern parenting (in that we share a mutual respect)? 

at the end of the day, i know i love self-sabotaging and self-destructing. and i KNOW it hurts them. it hurts me to see me being the cause of their pain, but only if they’d understand me when they were actually the start of mine. 

what is a girl supposed to do? i’m incapable of thinking straight or maintaining genuine feelings at this point. everything is a contradiction and i just don’t know what to do anymore."
depression,Life is long,"I’m 35(F) I’ve felt a deep and constant sadness for as long as I can remember. When I was younger I used to believe that one day I’d feel different, that I would figure it out get better. But now, I’m just tired. Life is long."

depression,Everyone else around me is so successful while I fail at everything I try to do,"Take my roommate for example. At only 18, she's in college and doing well academically, speaks several languages and has a well-paying job and an active social life. Just a few weeks ago she got her driving license and bought her first car with her own savings. Her schedule is always so busy but she somehow still makes time to drive me to my therapy sessions and deal with my bullshit on the daily. And she's so happy and positive throughout it all too.

Meanwhile, I'm 21 and what am I doing? Nothing. I'm doing nothing. The only thing I got going for me is that I'm in college, but even so I'm failing more classes than I'm passing. I don't have a job, I don't have a social life, I don't even have the energy to get out of bed in the morning. And I'm sitting here like a pathetic piece of shit and complaining on Reddit about how much my life sucks instead of doing anything even slightly productive."
depression,Why can’t I just be happy?,"Why do I feel the need to constantly compare myself to others? Why do I let my intrusive thoughts take control even though I’ve literally been aware that this is happening for like 2 years? Why can’t I move on from my failures and the past? Why do I constantly blame myself for everything?Why do I hate how I look? 
Honestly I feel like I’m dying. I’m sinking in my bed right now. Maybe I’m not strong enough for this world."
depression,"All this while, I can only drag my feet to move forward. But not anymore.","First of all, I know that I have Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) without even going to see a psychiatrist (being a med student myself). All this while, I tried to move forward no matter the pain and be optimistic. But now, even a single steps taken every single day took a lot of efforts

It's not the struggles in med school that made me despaired but all my worst of luck in anything i do. Before this, I always believed that I make my own luck. Now? I'm not even sure anymore.  

In my case, helping others will always ends up big success. When it comes to doing things for my own self? Failed. Big time. Even failed at committing suicide. Not even antidepressants works anymore.

From there, almost nothing in my life gone right no matter how hard I put efforts to succeed. 

Not even my family take my depression seriously. They would rather believe in stupid superstitions. Made me feel that this world is just a place of punishment.

Guess, I'm just a failure as a human being.

Sorry that it's long. I don't even know what to do anymore."

depression,Constant sleepiness,I’ve been going through court the past year over my kids and I’ve been very depressed over it and it causes me to be very sleepy during the day and especially when I’m home from work it seems like all I want to ever do is sleep and I don’t feel like doing anything else. Anyone else experience this?when will it clear up and when will I start feeling like doing other things and enjoying life again? My court case should be cleared up in a month so I’m hoping that will fix it.
depression,Broken down,Really feel broken down. Been fighting the fight my entire life and things keep going wrong. This week has really been special though. My family was terrible to me at Christmas. Fired without warning or any write up at my job. And a couple friends went off on me. Some have also been supported but have lost hope in life and all faith in people. It feels like this has been my entire life and will be my entire life. Not sure if I am the issue or other people. Not sure where to go from here. No motivation to keep trying when this is always the ending…
depression,Does hope ever make you feel worse?,"I am perpetually worried about my future. I just want so badly for things to work out for me, for me to eventually be happy and find a life partner and have a big joyful family and good memories. But the more I hope for all of this the more afraid I become. And when I do feel happy, I become afraid because I feel it will be short lived. 

Has anyone felt this way in the past and been able to overcome it and actually end up with the general/rough sort of things you have hoped to have?

I attempted to do it when I was 13 and the tie I used broke💀 and I kinda wish it worked back then. I’m planning on doing it on the 2nd of January 2022 this Sunday. It’s pretty much my last week hopefully. And Ik that I’ll probably hurt ppl but I honestly don’t care, no one should be hurt excessively as no one does anything for me at all. I’m not even leaving anyone a note because no one has ever given me closure in my life. Life is just pointless for me atp ppl say “it gets better” but why should I wait for that. Death and pain are the only things certain in life and I’ve convinced myself that im not being selfish because why can’t I make the rescission the unalive myself if im going to die anyways ?"

depression,Numbness,"I feel weak and numb, I feel like Harry Potter when the dementors attacked him, like all the happiness was sucked out of my life.

It's so annoying, I can't even say hello to my mates when I'm chatting with them, if they call me I'm silent and they only hear the tapping of my computer or my guitar.

The thing is, I just want to be out there, I want to feel like someone.

I want to be someone to someone, like a friend, a good daughter, someone who makes someone proud, but I can't be that person.

All I am is the fatty of the school, the short fat dork who does nothing right.

I can't even making my parents smile let alone them say the 2 words: ""I'm proud.""

It's so painful all the time, I feel like no one cares. 

I just wish I could erase myself from existence.

A lot of the time when I try being out there people just frown down at me like I'm a dog trying to be a cat or something.

Is it not normal for someone introverted to try and be more optimistic?

I'm so pessimistic I swear.

depression,Happiness in self Control,"WHEN MENTAL ENERGY IS allowed to follow the line of least resistance and to fall into easy channels, it is called weakness. When it is gathered, focused, and forced into upward and different directions, it becomes power; and this concentration of energy and acquisition of power is brought about by means of self-control. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I[n speaking of self-control, one is easily misunderstood.](https://utopianlife.org/self-discipline/) It should not be associated with a destructive repression, but with a constructive expression. The process is not one of death but of life. It is a divine and masterly transmutation in which the weak is converted into the strong, the coarse into the fine, and the base into the noble; in which virtue takes the place of vice, and dark passion is lost in bright intellectuality. 

 

[There is no force in the universe that can be annihilated or lost. Energy is transformed, but not destroyed. To shut the door on old and bad habits is to open it to new and better ones.](https://utopianlife.org/the-thought-factor-in-achievement/)

Renunciation precedes regeneration. Every self-indulgence, every forbidden pleasure, every hateful thought renounced is transformed into something more purely and permanently beautiful. Where debilitating excitements are cut off, there spring up rejuvenating joys. The seed dies that the flower may appear; the grub perishes, but the dragonfly comes forth."

depression,At a low point,"Ever since I was a young boy I’ve been seeing counselors and psychiatrists for my mental health. I am currently in the system now until march for my behavior (by in the system I mean on court ordered treatment) . I feel like a broken man, always being criticized for being depressed when that’s just the way I am.

I’ve been homeless since I was 16, fending for myself and trying to use the time and energy I have to get a solid living situation, but there’s something that happens to ruin the situation or make it hard for me to stay. There’s no solid resources in my area as far as I have experienced. Halfway houses full of drama, bugs, thieves, fighting, etc.. 

I’ve been in the legal system as well since 16. The situations that have occurred happened due to in my opinion the frustration from being depressed and the outcome of this. I can’t say no to drugs and that’s making me feel weak and like a pushover. From Rehab center to inpatient treatment to transitional living, years of bouncing around like a football from a nfl game is not a healthy way to live and I’m losing my mind. 

I’m supposed to check into another rehab center tomorrow as I’ve been using street drugs on and off, and hopefully I can make more progress with this attempt to get sober. I have a plan. I know I have to put in the work to maintain a clean self which means aa meetings, routine exercise, and just the healthiest I can be physically and mentally. 

Any feedback is welcome I just want to see what people think about my life and maybe how I can improve in any way. Thanks"

I think in between that i lost my interest upon her. She wants me to call her, text her spend time with her. But i don't want to coz i think it's waste of my time instead i work toward my goals.

 Was is the right decision to dump her. It's been 3 days we haven't talked since then she blocked me as usual from every social media.
At the time of break up she told me that she still loves me n that i can come back to her anytime. I think her love for me is true but her nature drives me nuts. What to do I'm so much confused.

You know it feels like a chain that forbid me to fly and do what i want, so being a first daughter is like a curse to me

Because I cant do what I want, I cant enjoy my life

At the age of 37, I find myself right back at step 0 or even less, divorced, single, no friends, no job, no family...I do not even remember the last time I genuinely laughed out loud, I spend most of my days talking to myself or the couch and it has been like that for a good solid 6 years although the divorce was back in 2015 I thought I will be better off this marriage thing (and I do not regret it), more time to myself and doing the fuckever I want and having more money (till I lost my job and currently running on my life savings which are almost up). 

Another new year coming up, obviously, I can go out and attend any new year party and pretend I'm happy however I quit drinking so it will be quite hard to pretend, instead, I will just feel sorry for myself watching all the people around me, so I would rather spend it on my couch.   


Is there anything out there waiting for me? You know how you sometimes think your time will come eventually, I mean life can't suck forever, its got its highs and lows but deep down the idea that I will die alone is sinking in deeper, I can't trust humans anymore, last time I had sex was with my wife (that is almost 6 years) yea I can go out and play the player game but I can't be with anyone unless I genuinely have feelings towards them and right now I feel I will never find such a person especially with my difficulty in trusting anything let alone falling in love with someone. I don't even comment on things or post stuff this is not even my real name, but heck who cares, I don't even know why I am posting this, maybe just letting the world know how fucked up it has become or maybe I am the fucked up one either ways I am finding it really difficult to keep pushing through this thing called life and I thought I throw it out there to anyone who is struggling as well, you are not alone and I really wish and pray we will find our way out of that barrel, but I still have a single thread of hope that maybe just maybe life will be kind to the unfortunate someday."
depression,29.01.2021," Hi, 

I dont really know how to start this but I feel like i am running out of options so I guess ill turn to writing as what feels like the last resort.

Something inside is causing so much pain. Where, why, WHAT especially I would love to know. I am losing myself and everything that i had in me. Its like someone flipped a switch in the darkest corner of my brain and I do not have access to that part. Yet i am going down the darkest parts of my thoughts and mind trying to find sed switch, hoping that it will be around the next corner to only find yet another pit or tunnel. 

I feel lost, scared and emotionless but yet I feel so much. I could name more things i feel but i honestly cannot be bothered as I dont even know if some of things I feel are actaully real. It has been a bad year. Good things have happened but yet I am stuck in this space and I cannot break free. Ok i am in therapy and i will be starting treatment and i cant lie that does give me hope but it also scares me because what if it changes me to someone yet again that i do not know. I am just a body right now, I feel like i do not have a true soul anymore, its too damaged. Or lost. Or repressed by whatever it is holding me down. I think I have depression, well im kinda sure.. You dont feel these things without being depressed right ? But why am I depressed ? I have no reason ??? There are people out there that are a lot more worse off and I feel like im just complaining and that I should just get a grip and get on with it. Yet thats impossible. After many conversations with you I thought we had started to sort things out.. This going back around in circles constantly is draining and I wish I didnt have so much hope when I started to feel better because this wouldnt hurt as much now. Im dissapointed. Disspaointed in myself for letting myself get so low, get so stuck and what feels hopeless. You know what is one of things that really puts me off balance, sometimes I look at myself in the mirroir and i dont know who is looking at me. Its not the same as when you get a new haircut and keep catching yourself in the mirroir, or when youve put make up on for the first in ages or even when youre hungover and look as shit as you feel. It feels genuinely like Im seeing a stranger for the first time. Sure i know the features but theres something in the eyes. I see the sadness and I feel tha pain of this person and if it were anyone but myself I would probably reasure them but then the crashing realisation that its me hits. Then this stranger I see in the mirroir quicklu becomes someone i depise and want to get rid of out of my life. But shes sad and needs help but I fucking hate her. Shes stopping me from doing what I know I can do and want to do. I dont even want to be around myself and I understand that other people dont. My close friends and boyfriend have tried so much and yet here I am not getting anywhere. All because of this stranger in the mirroir who is haunting me. The stranger is sucking the life out of me and my soul. Im 24 and these should be the best years of my life and yet I think everyday about when this feeling(s) will stop and when I'll be ok, knowing that, that will probably never be the case and I should stop it myself. Thats when the thoughts get dangerous and scary because i dont want to kill me but the stranger I see. Unlucky for me this stranger doesnt exist without me even if I am trying to exist without her, I now feel like I do not exist without this stranger. So im stuck. What more do i have to do? How much more time can I wait ? Do I still have enough power and hope in me to beat this ? I dont know anymore. It hurts. 

Ive tried talking and telling to my family how I feel but theres nothing to be done. Im losing contact with them slowly so if i do lose this battle maybe it would hurt them less. I need to protect people from me. From this destructive path im on. 

I am now crying too much to put this down into more words so until maybe next time, please keep going, I dont want to lose you completely yet. 

From 

The stranger that lives in you.  "
depression,"I've tried 2F-DCK (a Ketamine analog) and it's helped my depression immensly. It's a research chemical so I can't reccomend it, but it might be worth as cheap and legal alternative to Ketamine infusions, for those wanting to self-medicate.",[removed]
depression,I just want a good life.,"All I want is a happy family, a comfortable salary, and a nice house. You know Roger's family from Lethal Weapon? A happy nuclear family and well paying job that requires some sort of skill. That's what a good happy life looks like too me. I want to be happy and comfortable, and when I envision my dream life, this is what I feel will make me happy. I'm filled with a sense of happiness when I imagine the life I want. But then out comes my deep hopelessness. 


There is a problem that comes into play. I strongly believe that the genetic intelligence required for what constitutes a happy health life are out of my reach. I feel inadequate in everything I do. I just finished a semester of college and I just feel a degree isn't worth it. What's the point of trying if my lack of intellectual make the life I want impossible to achieve? 



Either my belief is the true fact of the matter or it's due to a lack of self esteem. The way I see, both scenarios make me feel hopeless. If it's the former, life isn't worth living as there is practically no chance I will get that future life. My ambitions for a happy life are stunted by  low intelligence. If it's the latter, life isn't worth living either. What is the likelihood of perspective changing dramatically in mid to late adulthood given you've held on to it since childhood? In my non-professional opinion, not likely. 


Everyone says that with smart or hard work you can achieve anything. It's complete bullshit. Not all of us can be engineers and doctors even if we put in more effort than those with gifted intelligence. And I want to be clear, it's not that I've worked particularly hard. But sometimes I feel that working hard isn't even worth it given my lack of intellect. 


It makes me incredibly angry and sad knowing that I can work hard for something I want and will never achieve it due to shit outside of my control. There are people who live to achieve eons of happiness and comfort with just 5% of my effort. The will achieve the life I want and more. This just isn't fair given what I've been through. 


My high school experience was lack luster to say the least. I had some shitty teachers and my focus was non-existent. My absences were practically tolerated by my parents. I also had an abusive father when I was child and early teen. It wasn't so much physical abuse but the self esteem destroying type. He berated me and tore me down emotionally. I felt I couldn't be myself whenever he was around. I couldn't trust him so I couldn't be vulnerable around him. I was essentially a robot or zombie whenever he was at home. I was practically dehumanized as a child. I've lived in shitty housing and poverty stricken neighborhoods. I feel like I deserve a happy life in adulthood given the shit I've put up with in childhood. I deserve hard work to ""work"" for me. 


It saddens me greatly when I come across people from good families and great wealth achieve even greater wealth and happier families. I know that I cannot achieve even 5% of what they have and this just destroys me mentally. I'm deeply pessimistic about what the future holds. I don't want to be alive if I can't be happy and comfortable. Why live if there is no effort that makes the life that will make me happy possible? I'm not interested in trudging through life living pay check to pay check slaving away for medium wage scraps just to come home to a shitty relationship with an abusive spouse. I'm not interested in poor housing and non-existent educational opportunities for my children. All of the facets of an unhappy life I mentioned were the lives of my parents, and the lives of my grandparents. This is the life that awaits high ambition and low intelligence."
depression,Contemplating suicide,"I just feel so depressed. I feel like I have lost everything in life. I have no one to talk. Life hasn't been kind to me. I just want to end my sufferings. I don't know what to type, but I feel so numb. I just feel so lonely."

I'm diagnosed severe depression and anxiety, But my family thinks I'm just ""attention seeking"" so I cant talk to them about anything, And I cant talk about it to my ""friends"" even if I wanted to its to hard.

depression,An increasingly strange feeling growing with time,"Been increasingly going through this feeling that there is something not right

No matter what I do, what I change, what I try to ignore, I can’t shake it. I honestly can’t remember the last time I’ve gone a day without thinking about killing myself.

What’s most pathetic about me is that my environment around me isn’t bad, it’s just entirely mental for the most part. I can’t stop hating myself, I just can’t stop. I’ve been cutting my thighs up so bad lately that I genuinely can’t count how many cuts are on me. 

I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can do this, how much longer I can continue faking everything to hide my depression. I’m to the point where I’m about to disappear, disconnect from everyone and everything and give myself one year to fix myself, and if I can’t. I’m taking my gun and I’m going to sit on the beach, just sitting there staring at the ocean until I pull the trigger. I just don’t want to anymore."

depression,I wish I could forget it all,"I wish I could forget it all. For as long as I have so many bad memories, I'll always be depressed to my core. The trauma, the guilt, the shame, the mistakes, the embarrassment. There's no single thing in my life that has gone so wrong that a person couldn't recover from it, but the sheer volume of painful thoughts leaves me feeling quite irreversably emotionally disabled. Where does it start and where does it end? It always has been and it's endless, and it keeps getting worse the more time goes by.

It sucks, I'm at a point in life where realistically, there's no way I can just turn things around and recover. I can only learn to live with the damage and accept my lowered expectations of myself. But with everything I've got going through my head now, I can't do the most basic things that can keep me on steady footing. It's looking real bad.

Recognizing how limited I am by decades long depression, I don't expect myself to keep going much longer - I really am concerened I won't have the will to live much longer. There's not much use in talking anymore about it. It's wait and see. If I make it through the next month or two, that'll be an accomplishment, but I'm nowhere close to doing anything spectacular to make lasting improvement to my current trajectory."
depression,Cutting off emotional vampires,"Trigger warning: This topic discusses suicide.

At first, it's okay to say you're having these thoughts. It's brave. And people will not generally ghost or slow fade you if you come clean with these thoughts...ONCE. 

However, I have an acquaintance I met in a chronic pain subreddit who exchanged numbers with me and has, no lie, expressed suicidal ideation two dozen times in the last year. She has said it 3 times just this month. And I really fucking resent it. 

I am somebody dealing with depression, PTSD, addiction, and chronic pain myself. I deal with suicidal thoughts too, but when people ask how I'm doing, if I'm not well I simply dodge the question. I will not burden them over and over.

I am in no position to be somebody's therapist as I'm dealing with the same condition she is. I've spent countless hours offering ideas and she disregards all of it. She's petrified of getting worse, as am I. But I am risking it and putting my body through torture via multiple surgeries (4 this year) 

In that case, all she's doing is dumping on me, and here I am afraid to ghost her or say goodbye because what if that's the tipping point that sends her over the edge? I've never even met this person but can't bring myself to do it. But truth be told I do not want to talk to her anymore."

Not a career. Not love(ha). Nothing. I can barely get out of  bed and sometimes I can't do that and just try and sleep away my problems.  I made a previous post on another subreddit that pretty much sums up with what I'm dealing with; friendlessness, hopelessness, financial problems, social problems and so on. I'm at rock bottom and I can't claw my way out like i usually do. Because there are no helping hands reaching to pull me out. It's just me.

I just really want the emotions to go away. I wouldn’t even describe it as pain at this point. just so many mixed and mangled emotions that make it hard to breathe at night.

depression,The death of me,"This phone.  This phone will be the death of me.

It takes me so much god damn effort to go about my day being productive and unwinding sustainably.  And all my phone wants me to do is keep scrolling, keep eyeballs locked to the content.  Keeps me from getting good sleep, keeps me from going outside more, from exercising more, from enjoying a book or practicing a new recipe.  

This fucking phone warps my reality, robs me of time and daylight, wastes my energy and focus.  I fucking hate it and i fucking hate that I'll never be able to abandon it because of all the ways this addiction is enabled and encouraged by my surroundings.  I hope I can get the high ground over this fucking thing before it kills me."
depression,life is hazy,"I just can't imagine myself being a real functioning person. it's not that I don't do some stuff myself, I've been fine with school and uni and everything, but I think living at home has made me unprepared for life. not that I think I'll have one, I feel kind of childish imagining my own future. like I'm getting a super cool electric guitar for Christmas thanks to my parents, and I laugh at the thought that I might get to be a decent guitar player. how is that any good for me? I mean in 50 years I'll be just as useless as I am now, so it's really hard to imagine anything being worth it. it's not like I deserve any good anyway though, I've been so useless at anything worth doing, just doing enough to get through because I'm so fucking lazy I can't commit to my own life. and I'm supposed to believe in God, who I've also let down. now I'm gonna be getting my first job at 20 years old and I somehow have to confront complete strangers on a daily basis if I get a retail job. this is supposed to be easy right? I've at least been trying, and dad asks me if I really want a job like I'm a motivated person? nah, I'll just put a few applications in and let everyone else pressure me in to actually progressing my life as usual. I know I'll have to get something done anyway, cos I won't be ending my own life any time soon, but my future is just invisible, like I know I'm gonna look back and realize that memories don't mean much at all? if nothing truly satisfies you, how do you just exist knowing nothings perfect? 

if you read all that, thanks. It doesn't matter if anyone replies, I'll be talking to a counselor soon enough, and this rant wasn't worth reading anyway."
depression,i don’t have much to live for anymore,i have a friend and a brother that mean the world to me. i really don’t want to hurt them by killing myself. the urge gets so overpowering sometimes that i just sob for hours. they’re the only people that mean the world to me. i couldn’t care less about anyone else. i couldn’t care less about anything else. i’m constantly doing the wrong thing and i’m constantly disappointing myself and everyone around me. it’s getting hard to sleep and i’m overeating absolutely everything in sight. i just feel like everyone would be so much better off without me in their life. one less person to think about. fuck idk
depression,Why am I still trying?,"Hello there.. I kinda had some emotions earlier that made me want to try something new by sharing my feelings to the public. I'm not a good talker and not really sure where to start but I'll try my best. Sorry if I mention some weird things that should've been kept to myself.


Not sure if it matters but I'm a 23 year old male. I have many issues in life, some smaller than others but still issues. Some days I feel like I'm absolute trash that doesn't deserve to live and other days I feel totally empty inside. I have a good idea of what would make my life finally feel good but I can't reach it. My dream is to fall in love, marry an amazing woman, have kids and live a normal life with my family. I'm nowhere near achieving this and I don't know how to fix this.


I'm a highschool dropout. The two main reasons on why that is because I have extreme social anxiety and I have always had trouble learning things. I've never been tested for learning disabilities as far as I know but I wouldn't be surprised if I had some. This is making it really difficult to find a job. Money doesn't buy you happiness straight up but it's necessary. I live with my mom and I'm thankful for not being kicked out on the streets but I'm so sick of mooching off her. I know I'm still young but 23 is an adult age yet I feel like a child still. I feel uneducated about most things in life including adult responsibilities. I just want to feel like a normal human and I'm sick of it.


I tried medicine for my social anxiety before and nothing ever had any effect on me so I gave it up. One day though I swallowed a whole bottle of Xanax and that day I attempted suicide in 2018 by jumping off a bridge. I thought about suicide the day before I took them so idk if it had any effect on what I thought. I didn't do research on it but I guess it wasn't high enough to kill me idk. I fractured lots of parts like my wrists, pelvis, leg and spine even. I was court ordered to have therapy after but it didn't do anything for me and I knew it wouldn't either as talking doesn't help me. I now have a 20k unpaid hospital bill due to my mistakes. Luckily I healed up okay over the years and my main issue now is my bad back. It hurts to bend over for too long or even stand for too long. Maybe if I was more active then I could make it feel better over time but I have no time to focus on that and it's harder for me. I started over eating after leaving the hospital for a couple years. I'm not in the worst situation but I now weigh 180 at 5'6. I always had issues with my looks before but now I want to puke when seeing myself in the mirror. All my weight has gone into my face and belly. 


I have issues with my diet because I have terrible taste buds. I cannot eat fish, vegetables, most fruits and much more without gagging, almost vomiting or actually vomiting. I used to at least give some things a try when I was a little younger even if it was still hard but now I just simply look at something and my brain tells me ""don't eat it"". I'm incredibly picky with the stuff I do like too like I can eat chef boyardee spaghetti but home made or restaurant is disgusting. I like chicken from restaurants but I hate grocery store chicken. I only eat white meat and it has to be boneless. I could go on but it's easier to say that my diet is just Mac and cheese and pizza. I think I've given up on trying to eat healthy and it would be fine by me if I could lose the weight in another way but I just can't right now. I've tried fasting before and it works but only if I workout with it. I haven't worked out since my surgeries and I can't really try either because I have issues with my feet right now and my back hurts really bad. 


I have really bad ingrown toenails right now that I can't really take care of because I have no insurance anymore and I really don't want another huge hospital bill. They affect my life pretty significantly. I haven't left my house in 3 years because I can't even wear shoes without them bleeding. I also self diagnosed myself with Trichotillomania as I pull my hair out constantly every day all day. I also have lots of mini mental issues like I have a big fear of all bugs and even loud noises. I can't even take a crap in peace if anyone is near by and I need a fan or faucet running to drown out the noise. I have issues thinking of proper words to say during conversation and I'm even very forgetful about lots of things in my life. I applied for Medicare and was denied and even tried to apply for disability close after leaving the hospital. Could barely make it through the, I guess mental/social test because of my social anxiety. My voice was so shakey and I couldn't look the man in the eyes and I was about to burst into tears just talking with him about normal things. The physical test made me test my blood pressure and as usual it was through the roof they even made sure it was right by testing it multiple times and using other equipment and had others test it to. After that it was literally 2 minutes before they said I was good to go. I was asked to stretch and bend over and here I am sounding like an old man and I was in pain yet they thought I was fine. They based it off of 2 minutes. I felt so upset because it took so much courage for me to leave my house and go through that type of thing.


I know this is disgusting but I had my first shower in about a year a couple days ago. I can't seem to even find motivation to hop in the shower anymore because I just don't care and I also don't want to go through the pain of bending over and trying to clean hard to reach places on my body. My toes always end up worse than they looked before after a shower too. Luckily I had a LDR relationship for 2 years so they couldn't smell me but she recently broke up with me. Not surprising with the life I live but that almost destroyed me and I thought about killing myself but got lucky by quickly finding someone else that understood my garbage life. Im currently dating another girl that's across country but I know it's just going to end the same way because it's a group effort to save money to end up together in the end. I make no money so how can I even think about dating when it just won't work. Romance is the only part of my life that makes me happy but I can't keep it.


I had a small burst of motivation that lasted I dunno maybe 2 hours to take a practice GED test. Forgot and failed every thing even basic math. Tried to read the explanations on the answers and it just hurt my head so badly that I had to stop. I can't seem to learn things like that as it just goes through one ear and out the other. I never studied before as a kid either because it just never did anything for me. I'm afraid I'll never find work without my GED though so idk what to do.


I really have no idea what my point is here besides just sharing every shitty detail of my life but what I know is that I just want to feel like a normal person. All I do every day is watch TV and sometimes play video games. I have no other hobbies or things that interest me. I feel like the worst person on earth sometimes and I really don't know why I continue to live. I have the motivation to want to work and make lots of money to slowly fix parts of my life like having my own place, car, buying what I want and need. It would also help my dream of being together with my loved one and I could even finally buy presents for everyone near Christmas time. The issue is I can't even do that because of all my other issues getting in the way. I have no idea what I should do to start fixing my huge mess of a life. I really have feelings for my girlfriend but she's been hinting that if I can't find work soon then we'll probably not be together long. She has a beautiful heart and accepted everything else I shared with her and I don't blame her for thinking that. I've been thinking that if I lose her then I'll probably just kill myself because I'm tired of my shitty life. What do I do? is there someone out there that can help me? I really don't think there is."

We had quite a fights about these but it always ends in him saying - ""You never told me this before, and you liked my family before, now you are acting weird"". On top all this, I have lost my job and am not able to find one since a year as am always depressed about it. And Ive grown up in a toxic family, nothings ever a simple conversation in my family. Almost everything is riddled with passive aggression, subliminals, trauma and projection. And they dont care about me. From all this I have this constant urge to run away from everybody and be on my own."
depression,I’m a burden in everyone’s life,"Every friend or family member I’m close to tries to help me, but I never get any better. They try to offer me advice, they try to distract me from my pain, they try to be there when I need them, but I know that they’re sick and tired of trying to make me better. People can only tolerate my bullshit for so long and then they either expect a noticeable improvement or they don’t want to deal with me anymore. I wish I could be better. It’s like they don’t know that I want to be better. I want to be happy. I want to feel good about myself. I want all of those things, but I seem to be irreparably broken. It doesn’t matter how many times someone gives me healthy advice or encourages me, I always stay the same. I don’t want to bother people anymore so more often than not I shove my feelings down because I know nobody wants to hear about how shitty I’m doing for the millionth time. It doesn’t help that a lot of my problems are things that are out of my control. I know that I cannot control the actions of others, only myself, so it hurts when I need something from other people and have no way of getting it. Not to even get started on the reality that what I need most is to love myself (which I hate as an idea because it sounds tremendously cliché and because I don’t know how to do it)."

depression,I’m ruining my future,"Last week, one of my friends barged into my house and tried to force myself to go to school.

I haven’t been going even though I know I have to. I honestly do try so hard to make it, but every morning I end up sobbing on my bathroom floor over nothing. The simple thought of waking up the next morning is even tough to think about.

I used to be such a good student, taking AP and honors classes and passing all of them with As and Bs while also being in numerous clubs and being on sports teams. I had a whole plan and was preparing myself for college and a career after that. I used to be ambitious and motivated as my future was so important to me.

Now I can’t even imagine myself being successful as I used to. That same friend doesn’t think I’ll even go to college anymore. 

I haven’t done homework in weeks. I quit the sports team I’m in even though it’s one of the things I love the most. I had to because I wasn’t even able to get myself up and go to practice. I’m preparing to get kicked out of the only club I’m in because I’m not involved enough. I’m a bum. 

I know I did this to myself, but I can’t seem to get out of this loop. I’m so terribly disappointed. I have nothing anymore. No hope, no future, no motivation, nothing.

I’ve isolated myself from my friends and pushed new ones from becoming close with me. 

Everything that I am upset with now is all my fault. So I don’t understand why it’s so hard for me to try to fix. 

I don’t even feel as if I have a valid reason to be acting this way. I’m privileged as fuck and shouldn’t have anything to complain about. So why do I feel so shitty? I don’t know.

Looking for advice"
depression,Wasted youth and life,"I spent so many years failing to be a man.  I allowed myself to be stepped on, pressured to do things I didn't want to,  and wither away. I wish I didn't listen to my family.  I wish I didn't let myself be disrespected by peers. I wish I made choices for myself instead of avoiding confrontation from my family or society. I wish I lived for myself instead of others. 

The formative years of my life are gone. I will never have them back.  I should have been educated in many areas of life but I haven't.  I'm no better than I wasat 18. My maturity and intellect is low,  so is my life experience.  I wasted the years I had to become someone I could accept. 

Instead I'm a loser with nothing going for him.  I see no point in looking forward because I've already strayed too far off any path worth traveling"
depression,"If / When you wish to be social, what comes to mind for conversation?","Title as a legitimate question. I could ask this wherever, for a general populace, but I am honestly curious for answers specifically from those who might be / are depressed in their lives. Sure there's trying to get to know somebody, but I see that as slightly different.

So, anything for conversation, specific or not? Should it be as simple as ""hey did you see the game last night"" or weather talk, until random spouts of inspiration as to theories about the enigma of the universe, or... what ideas come to your mind?

I ask for a few reasons, but it'd be boring to list 'em. I'll probably delete this post in the morning out of anxiety and embarrassment, I don't expect any response. Being social can be very difficult in any capacity, not just for myself. G'day to ya &amp; thank you for your time."
depression,It does get better,"After fighting Clinical Depression, PTSD, Anxiety issues for more than 2.5 years. I need this to convey everyone that it does get better and no, life doesn’t end there and all those medicines you thought would be bad and ruin the little life you have? Thats hoax too, we criticise medical world too much while we try to build this “organic” life of ours. 

When I was about 16, this disease started taking a hold of me. I must say there could be a graphical representation of this, and growth is gradual. From the onset of your disease, the first time you thought you want to commit suicide; it may take about 2-3 years as usual to reach the peak point where you realise that you have a mental disorder. 

 Now not everyone has the money or time to visit a therapy but you can get medicines at-least, and the side effects are nothing as compared to the side effects of depression itself. So it is better to start your treatment instead of visiting that suicidal thought everyday. 

Furthermore, not every depression is genetic, not every depression occurs without any reason, so try to find the root cause of it (if any) like financial issues, relationships, childhood trauma and abuses and deal with those issues simultaneously.

Also physical activities like gymming or going out for a walk, spending time near natural beauty like mountains and forests, going for random rides while listening to your playlist help to cope with it. 

Conclusively, it will get better. Just take that one step towards betterment, don’t doubt yourself and you will find the path forward."

depression,I just wanna kill myself so badly,Even though people have depression I always feel like its never like mine..  I see so many people here talk about relationships and shit.

depression,i dont get why people argue against suicide,listen i know death hurts the people witnessing it but it is the choice of the person doing it. suicide is a choice that is okay the world sucks already we all have the choice to give up on all that pain an suffering

depression,I don't know why I'm doing this. I feel annihilated,"I have no idea why I'm posting this here. I have no one to talk to about my depression but my dad (who can't understand me, but it's not his fault. He is a beautiful person).

This is the second time in the last months that I woke up and feel deeply lonely, depressed and anxious at the same time. I just don't know why.
I have not the force or the will to tell my whole story, it would take too much and nobody really cares. 
I just needed to let it out somewhere and Reddit is the first thing that came up in my mind. Started crying without a reason (I have never been a guy who cries easily).
I have talked to my dad and he said ""don't worry it's okay, we will do anything we can to fix this"". He thinks it's because of an exam I have in few days. Maybe it is but I've never felt that way in the past. I've never got depressed because of an exam and I'm sure the exam is just the trigger, but there something more inside me. A monster who is trying to catch me and I'm exhausted of running and running and running.. 
I am thinking to seek help to psychologist. 
I don't feel myself anymore, I am losing my identity and this scares the fuck out of me. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, but I always managed to ""control"" this really bad thoughts. I have no energy. I don't know why.

depression,Feeling down,"I just feel so down right now. I have no motivation to get out of bed, everything feels the same and things that used to bring me joy are just becoming boring. I’m losing the will to keep going, and I just want to quit trying. I feel like I should be sad, but I just don’t feel anything at all. I don’t know why either, as everything in my life is more or less fine. I can’t honestly tell if it’s just a phase of my life where it’s hard or if I’m bordering being clinically depressed. Does it end up getting better without treating it or should I try to do something about it? That being said I don’t know what I’d do."
depression,A rant about relationships,"The first relationship I was in ended in my partner cheating on me. It wasn't a very serious relationship; it didn't hurt much. The next relationship I would go on to have would end in them breaking up with me after a few weeks to instead be friends (which I'm fine with). 

But a few days ago I asked a girl for some relationship advice. I wanted to ask her out but I didn't want to ask her out just yet. I also told her that I was absolutely terrified of going to my school's winter formal but I wanted to go to make the other person happy. 

She started being very intrusive and aggressive about how she asked who the other person was. I tried a number of different ways to tell her that I didn't want to tell her who I liked. I had known that she liked me but I just wasn't quite ready for a relationship (and now I doubt the idea of a relationship more). 

I had realised that she was kind of manipulative. I know she has always struggled with anxiety and depression and it doesn't look like she's got the greatest support from people in her life. Her last boyfriend was abusive and manipulative. 

Sorry for this post, it's essentially just a rant. If you have any advice or questions I'd be happy to hear it."
depression,just end it,im done i want it all to end . I dont want to be on this earth anymore its just pointless .

I've gone through every fucking professional process for help it's all useless on me - maybe I'm not really part of the human race? Maybe I'm just reacting healthily to that fact? Maybe there's some kind of cosmic reason for me never fitting in and always being miserable I dunno what to do"
depression,Stay Strong People,"To anyone reading this, stay strong and fight the good fight.  There are different sources for depression:  our own regrets, lacking things in life... remember, we ALL have done the best with the knowledge we had at the time.  In hindsight we can see clearly how we messed things up, but we must learn from our mistakes.   For other reasons such as having bad parents or bad living situations:  remember, you did not chose your parents or the situations you are in.  One never would.   

Get in touch with yourself and your own connection to the divine.  You don't have to believe in a religion or any God...  just believe in that inner strength you have, take each day at a time and learn from it.

We are all going to have those weak moments, but please never take the ""easy"" way out...  for we never know what happens tomorrow."
depression,Want to die so badly but not being able to do it myself makes everything so much worse,"im 18, no friends (even online since they all have lives now), no job, nothing to do all day, never had a girlfriend, took my ged so i dont go to school anymore, basically missed out on everything you do as a teen, my mom knows that i started taking drugs and have been really distant from me when i need them the most. so more than anything i just want to die and not have to worry about anything anymore i just want to be done but cant get myself to do it. maybe one day."
depression,Wish I didn’t struggle with hygiene,"These past few months have been…so rough. I abruptly developed a form of dermatitis that has me needing to shower more frequently, but it’s always been so difficult to shower even once a day. I haven’t really been able to keep up any consistency so far. The most I can really do is once or twice a week. 

I know it’s strange, but I kind of wish I could have someone just talking there in the background on a call, just to help keep my mind grounded from intrusive thinking. Since I tend to deal with depression &amp; GAD, it’s often calming to have a distraction from my own mind. I just don’t really think I have anyone to ask that would be fine with me being on mute and just listening in. Doesn’t help that I take long showers, lol.  

I’m also aiming for brushing my teeth twice (morning &amp; night), but the most I manage to get in is once a day. It’s not too bad, but I’d really like to improve on that end too. 

Keeping up with hygiene has always been difficult, and I really should try keeping up with it more now. But it’s just a lot, and I wish it didn’t feel like a lot, but it does."
depression,I’ve Accepted That Bad Things Only Happen to Me,"No therapy can help me. No drug, prescription or recreational can help me. Everybody is repulsed by my insignificance existence to help me. 
No magical privileges fall into my lap to make my life better. 

I live in a shitty town that brings me nowhere. I can’t drive. I’m not intelligent enough for school. I’m trapped here to ferment in my rotten existence. 

All I can do is hurt myself and scramble in a fail manner to do anything. My life goes through phases of only people using me for their own pleasures. Nothing is satisfactory to me anymore. 

Everyone accepts this because that’s what I made to be until I’m tried to go to sleep from numbing myself through the pain."
depression,Soaring Highs and Devastating Lows,"I just had the best trip, all by myself, to see a concert which was one of the greatest experiences of my life as it was such an intimate gig/venue, and I even got to have a face-to-face chat with the performer after the show.

However, once I returned home to my family, that euphoria all came crashing down and my mood has been very dark ever since.

I am left to wonder should I leave them, go it alone, would I prefer to be by myself, or is that dangerous as then I would have nobody to support me during my bad days?

For the first time in around 9 months, I started having thoughts about just walking out of the house and disappearing, going somewhere so that nobody could find me and starting a new life elsewhere.

Does anyone else have similar situations where you've had a fantastic experience then your brain decides that it has to balance it out?"
depression,Is this some sort of mild depression?,"I dont think Im depressed or at least not heavily so really just testing the waters, in the last couple of years I feel myself less excited about things, Im still happy, do stuff, have a good life etc but dont tend to get really excited about anything, also my libido has dropped a fair bit too.  
So overall Im still happy and still go out, go away, do hobbies etc its more that I just am no super excited by anything, that and the libido bit :)

Im up early, work out 2-3 days a week (aiming for 4-5)

Im 40 in case that has anything to help.

Then if the above means its worth me seeing someone I will see about a therapist just to at least test the water :)"
depression,I feel like my physical illness really took my life,"I had spine injury in high school

after that I couldn't run and had difficulty with sitting for a long time.

in college i really got into digital art, but it was painful to draw

so I never got very far 

Then It got worse after college after I had a fall

I had surgery and felt pretty good for couple years

and then I started getting horrid pain for weeks at a time

I couldn't stand for more than 5min without fear of pain

this year starting in summer I can barely sit or stand without enduring pain , I have trouble sleeping because of pain

Doctor suggest another surgery but I am afraid

I can no longer enjoy my life now

It's too painful to draw, too painful to do chores... I don't go out for fun anymore...

I feel like my life has run its course"
depression,I hate everyone,But most of all I hate myself
depression,I have everything and I am numb to it.,"Probably the most controversial I've ever felt in my life. I feel like I live in a paradox.

I am in my late 20s, work as a mechanical engineer and I did everything I was supposed to do according to today's standards (get a partner that loves you genuinely, a house, a sports car, a pet, a degree, good job....you get it). I traveled a lot.....graduated uni in a different country, got a good taste of that college life. I even had a rock band and giged a lot. Had a lot of fun. Never did drugs besides the occasional blunt. All of it with my own money, sweat and tears...because I come from poverty, being born in the eastern european getto. 

Yet nothing .....nothing makes this feeling of hollowness go away. How is that even possible? How is it possible to achieve everything and being numb to it? I have problems connecting to reality. 

It's all a bubble. It's all built to make you feel just ok and content with your life and it feels wrong, am I the only one seeing it? Like an npc in a game, hence not the main character. And you don't have a say in it, because you are not the programmer, you are the programmed. 

The depression that I have been facing since my second year of university (so about 6 years now) has been eating me from the inside out and slowly everything has become so pointless. I get to do some exciting stuff now and then, but it's just a distraction, it's not real anymore. Am I ungrateful? I feel sometimes like I want to cease to exist. 

Anyone else in this boat?"
depression,what to do when you don’t want to be conscious (tw self harm/suicidal thoughts),are there any healthy coping mechanisms for when you don’t want to be conscious. i get the strong urge to head bang and want to knock myself out. i hate alcohol and don’t have access to any drugs that would give this effect and i wouldn’t seriously hurt myself or try to kill myself but i cannot stand being awake when i feel like this. does anyone have ways of coping with these feelings? it’s unbearable atm
depression,Need advice on taking pills and motivation,"Hi everybody.
I was diagnosed with depression in 2016 and used to go to a therapist for about 1,5-2 years, but stopped because I felt it wasn't helping me and instead making me agitated (my decision was supported by my psychiatrist).
I have been taking different types of prescribed medications until about 1 year ago. I started to forget to take my pills or was too lazy to take them every once in a while and it just kind of lead to me not taking them at all. I did feel like they were helping but like I said, I just sort of stopped taking them at some point. 
I see my psych about every couple of months. The appointment I went to in June I confessed to her that I haven't been taking my pills and she obviously said I should try to continue taking them. I managed to take maybe 2 before forgetting and avoiding them again. 
Then in September (my latest appointment) she seemed to have forgotten/didn't check her notes and didn't mention me not taking the pills so I didn't bring it up either (I was too embarrassed, I know its dumb).
In any case, I now have about a year or more worth of pills that I'm not taking and I don't really know where to go from here.
Since I feel fine, I think maybe I can ""officially"" stop taking them? 
I don't know. I mean I recently had my finals and I managed to get through them without a big fuss. I think I did pretty poorly on one of the tests and I'm worried if I might fail. But I was just kind of disappointed/ worried for the rest of the day but by the next day I was ok. I didn't cry, I didn't cut, I didn't do anything. I mean I panicked a bit but nothing that I wouldn't think normal people would do. I'm also currently working at a job I hate and it's gonna get much worse starting February next year and I don't have any escape from it at the moment, but aside from the occasional sense of doom, I'm still working and doing alright.
I still sometimes get sad but never for no reason and not to an extensive amount. I also don't really feel numb or anything.
I do have trouble taking regular care of myself like brushing my teeth or cleaning up but at this point I feel like that's a separate issue that I need to just make a habit. 

What do you think? Would you stop taking the meds or would you try and get back on them? 
And more importantly, if you suggest I continue taking them, how would I be able to motivate myself enough to actually do that? 

Anybody have similar experiences?

I'm sorry to ask you guys, I don't have any friends I could talk to about this and my boyfriend would rather not meddle in my mental health."
depression,i wish I was loved,"i wish I was appreciated, I wish I was worth something, I wish people cared about me, I wish I was desirable, I wish people gave me attention, I don't care about how annoying I sound, I just wish I felt affection and I want to die."
depression,dreams are lies everything is predetermined,"It sucks that human brains are limited in their capacity, like some people are just born with artistic abilities and others are genetically predisposed to see patterns in differential equations and shit. People have a purpose in life but it's never up to choice it's all predetermined by the universe. This being-alive bullshit is so last season and I'm sick of it."
depression,I don't know if I can do this much longer.,"I have so much self loathing. I would give anything to be someone else. I hate every single thing about myself. I hate my body, I hate my personality, my sense of humor, how I act, how I dress, how my voice sounds, everything. I've been hurt so many times but every time I only heal halfway and everything builds on top of itself until it becomes unbearable. I wish I wasn't so trusting, I wish I wasn't a pushover, I wish I could say no without feeling guilty. I want to get help but I'm afraid that it'll end up hurting someone else somehow. if my parents knew what it was like in my head I'm sure that they'd throw me into a mental hospital. I regret everything I have ever done up until this point in my life. I can never think straight, it feels like there's always some block in my brain that just prevents me from being able to think. All the time I've invested in my hobbies has gone to waste because I've lost interest in everything. I barely even make an effort to take care of myself. I think about trying to ""unalive"" myself regularly, but I don't want to die, I just want the pain to end. my friends probably all think that I try too hard to make other people happy and that I'm a ""pick me"". I just want to be someones favorite person, I want someone that'll hug me and tell me that it's all going to be okay. Loneliness sucks."
depression,I feel like an ass now after telling my co-workers im poor,"So ok, context i could say were not really struggling but i cant really say we're average either. I knew they are pretty well off and i just couldnt help being suddenly embarrassed when they were dropping me off our place and told them dont expect too much of me.

When i got home, my mom asked where they were and why i didnt invite them in. I shrugged and she just knew exactly what i did and told me not to shoo them away and not be ashamed of our home.

Now im thinking about it, i feel like i judged them too much for being well off, that they would have negative comments about me being not in their level. I feel like an ass rn."
depression,What do I do?,"I seemingly have it all. My own house, awesome Mrs and 2 kids that drive me mad but are so amazing, anyone would look at me and be envious. But to put it bluntly I really cannot be fucked anymore.
Why do u feel like this, 1 day I'm OK, OK at best. The next I just don't want to exist. I feel lonely at home even though I'm not at all lonely, at work I'm well respected in a job that's better than most but I can't even find enjoyment in it. I used to really enjoy creating stuff in my workshop but the thought of going there just does nothing for me. Who do I talk to? I feel the doctors will just want to give me some pills to take and not really get to the bottom of the issue, I'd rather not burden the Mrs with the whole truth if I'm honest because she will just worry. I'm sorry I'm dropping all this here I just don't know why I'm feeling like this."

5.I’m tired 
6.teachers and peers are annoying
7.the work loads to much
8. I feel unhappy/empty 
9.I have an eating disorder
10. Very mentally unstable 

Okay let’s start
I miss my ex let’s call him S, I miss him so much I can’t contact him I think I don’t know if I should even if I find him. I’m very crazy shit happened but I just I have mental breakdowns thinking of it.

As number 2 states I wanna die. Life’s on repeat like a tape I can’t seem to get out of wake up school home sleep if I can. 
I wanna be someone do something 

I hate my weight I’m not overweight but I always think I am I stopped having a good relationship with food like at 7 eating is such a challenge other days I can’t stop I look at calories seeing what’s the lowest self harming  every time I intake to many calories.

As 2022 hits I will be completely friendless with being with the same class of students AGAIN and rumours about me people don’t like me much nor do younger year levels seem to wanna hangout with older students.

One I didn’t mention I have a lot of medical problems which is so tiring I fantasie of dying to stop hurting medically physically and mentally.

I’m tired from everything try walking tired try talking tired (this is emotionally)
Exam after exam after reviewing reading tests notes work screaming studying it’s so much
I flipped out today with my exams.

I wanna rap and make beats I can’t I am too busy with work or to tired to do things I like.
I am left drained empty.

Mentally I’m quite bad I panic all the time and have way to many panic attacks and seizures or tic attacks it’s draining being called a faker as well.
I punish myself for making to much noise etc when I can’t help it.
I’ve done therapy for 8 years I’m not doing it.

depression,Am I depressed?,I've recently been feeling very tired and I don't want to wake up or get out of bed but I force myself to because I have to go to college. I've also had sudden urges to just sit and cry for hours. I've been under a lot of stress and whenever I'm stressed I just cry. I haven't had it diagnosed yet and I'm scared to talk to my parents about it so any advice would be great.

depression,Weird depressive behaviours,"I'm Bipolar, and when my mood dips or starts to dip a bit, I find that I have these weird habits that crop up.. Anyone else have weird things like this they do when depression starts to kick in? Here are some of mine -

- ordering in food even though I have food in the fridge, because somehow I can't bring myself to go downstairs without that delivery person ringing the doorbell, and even then I tend to scuttle back into bed again as quickly as I can. This morning I lay in bed for a few hours somehow unable to get myself up &amp; down to the kitchen, and eventually caved to the old habit and ordered porridge from deliveroo - I have the ingredients for porridge in my kitchen &amp; it takes 2 min in the microwave, and yet I felt I needed outside help.. crazy. I think part of it might be that I'm lonely and I think I might find it much easier to get up and get moving if I was living with someone.. Also I'm really trying to plan my days so that I have things to get up for.. I want to get better at this.. 

- a frustrating one that I'm also really not proud of is I would run a bath for myself and then procrastinate about actually getting in the bath, to the point where the bath water would go cold and it would be wasted. This one hasn't happened in a while, thankfully. It tends to be a red flag that all is not well with me. 

- another one is I would manage to get in a hot bath, which was great, but then I would sit in it for hours and really struggle to find the will to get out!! I would usually top it up with hot water, but sometimes I'd let it go quite cold and just sit in it feeling kind of numb. I did this a couple of nights ago. I think I was kind of exhausted &amp; overwhelmed, and scrolling on my phone to try and soothe my anxiety (I know this can be a bad habit too) When I eventually got out of the bath I was so relieved I actually cheered. 

I could probably continue listing more.. It's hard not to beat myself up about this stuff - wasting money, feeling a bit useless and dysfunctional.. But I'm hoping others might be able to relate?? I'm in recovery from two psych ward hospitalisations earlier this year. Making changes is not easy. I know I need to try to be kinder to myself. I think I need to let myself be a bit 'weird' sometimes just to find a way to take the next step in this life. 

Do you do weird stuff when depressed? I think solidarity &amp; sharing can help. How can we be kinder to ourselves under these crazy circumstances? I'm trying to break some cycles at the moment myself. Not easy but it has to be possible. Thank you for reading xo"
depression,If you need to function just for a day I have a tip.,"Do this at your own risk, but there have been studies that show sleep deprivation has an antidepressant effect. I couldn’t sleep because of my depression so I just stayed up all night and I actually feel a little relief from the depression. My anxiety got a lot worse though.  And it only lasts until you fall asleep again. So this is no permanent fix but a temporary relief if you have a day you just really need to function."
depression,I don’t know what to do anymore,"It’s currently almost 4 a.m. and I cannot stop thinking. Every time I stay up this late I find myself having a panic attack. And I mean every single time. I feel so alone and afraid. I sit in my room staring at the wall while my depression and thoughts eat me alive. I think about death and how scary it is. I think about how I could just end it all in the matter of seconds and I don’t have to be in pain anymore. I think about how fast time is going. Recently, its been how I can never tell the truth. I don’t think any of my friends know how my life truly is. My internet friends of 4+ years think i’m a year older than I am and I don’t know how I can confront them. I don’t know how to tell my irl friends whats going on at home and How I am slowly rotting away in bed everyday. I can’t talk to my parents because they don’t believe me. I dug myself so deep and I can’t get out. I feel like I’m drowning and there’s no escape. I feel sick to my stomach every time I think. I want it to go away I am so tired of crying and shaking and hitting myself because of my panic attacks. I can’t believe I have to do this and go to school in 3 hours. Hopefully I feel better"
depression,I dont know if im depressed anymore,"for some reason the past few weeks I dont feel depressed and Im questioning whether I have depression or it was all fake I still feel empty and my cognitive abilities still nonexistent but it doesnt feel bad to live now and I actually miss feeling like shit every day, anyone has this happen to them"
depression,Depressed but not in a I want to kill myself way,"I just have no motivation to do anything. Taking a shower and brushing my teeth every morning feels like the hardest task in life. 

I legit have no motivation or discipline or future goals. I’m in online college course and I hate it so much. I feel like quitting and finding my passion but have no idea what it is. 

I actually love life in that I am not suicidal or want to end my life. I just hate myself and the current way I’m living 


I have took meds before but I found I was unable to feel anything and that actually made me have some minor suicidal ideation. 

I think I will try therapy or something because I feel like I’m at a whits end

Just stuck and needed to rant"
depression,Idk What to do anymore,"Idk what to do anymore guys. All I do is game to make the thoughts go away, The anxiety I get even when I just think about going to my usual appointment with my therapist is just too much. I don’t want to do it anymore. Everyone just keeps telling me I can’t live like this forever so I have to do something, But i don’t even want to live"
depression,Feeling Regret,"Earlier, I was so frustrated over something small. It tipped my iceberg as the day in full seem to be better than the last. I felt horrible that my day became ruined because of this. I deal with great bouts of depression and self-hatred. I went to my sister to explain my frustration which turned into a deep talk where I told her I was suicidal and imagining self-harm. One of the worst mistakes I have done. I hate confining into people because it makes me so uncomfortable. Not only that, it was my sister who I was talking to and I try to distance myself from my family as much I can. It will be hard to interact with her in the next few days because of all of this. The only person I can really vent to is a therapist because I don’t really know them and I don’t have to see them all the time. I just feel so embarrassed for being that angry and sad in that moment. I hate showing vulnerability. My family already thinks of me as a inferior and waste of a man. I hate myself so much but my sister told me stop saying that. I will just end this off here: I will try to keep going for her and stop talking negatively about myself. This will be very hard but I will try. I’m just tired and this life seems to be on an endless loop."
depression,I wish I could snap out of it.,"My uncle accused me of causing my grandma's death. He wants to steal my late father's property. He has turned the family against me, leaving me isolated. The case is currently in court.

My mother is stressed because of the drama. We have not been that close but its getting worse, she pours her frustrations on me.

My ex girlfriend dumped me for someone else. She lost attraction towards me. Maybe because of the anxiety attacks.

I think I chose the wrong career but I don't know what else I'd rather do or how to go about it. I am unfulfilled and wasting time.

I have been over sleeping, dreading every morning and I occasionally miss work to do nothing. I'm losing interest in my hobbies. 

I dont know how to fix my life. I wish I could snap out of this funk and ne happy again."
depression,We live in hell.,[removed]
depression,I would have absolutely no hesitation about killing myself if it only took a year or two of my life,"First post on this subreddit, and to be honest I feel embarrassed about writing my own share here. I’m not genuinely suicidal and I haven’t been through anything close to some of the horrible shit people here have survived. I know suffering isn’t meant to be comparative and emotions should be validated, but it’s also key to read the room and not complain about hunger next to someone starving. I’m not alone, I have a family and a group of friends that love me, and I don’t think there’s a bad aspect of my life that is completely irreversible, and I’m extremely lucky to be able to say as much. With that out of the way, I’ll try to keep my experiences as brief as I can.

So I turned 18 five years ago, thought I was hot shit and a fresh adult, learned the hard way I was still mostly a child. The learning process included almost fucking up my career by junior year because of shameless laziness. Rarely failed classes, but parents paid tuition and money was tight, the money precisely covered eight semesters, no more no less. I wasn’t taking much care for my physical health (never got super unhealthy, I was just consistently the chubby friend), nor my appearance (whatever was most comfortable was what I went with). After having a mediocre-at-best sixth semester, lost my parents’ trust. It didn’t help that I had gotten my first girlfriend in that time, who happened to be in the middle of a case of being an alleged sexual assault victim. I don’t think she ever lied about that, I just think circumstances and her BPD + Extreme Personality Disorder painted a worse picture than what actually happened. At the time, though, I was fully invested in that story, and it wasn’t until she had multiple “black outs” drunk calling me and unintentionally harassing me (following me all the way to the hospital when I had appointments even when I asked to be alone and throwing herself on the street and mute screaming when I refused to kiss her). The breakup was brutal, even though it was the healthiest decision for the both of us, I felt like I has just killed a child. All of this throughout Spring 2019, where I just felt everything around me was collapsing.

Fall 2019 turned into my semester “break”, where I helped a family friend by being a waiter/cook to their restaurant for 50 euros a week (usually working 40 to 44 hours). I got to watch from afar as a good number of my friends graduated or had a good time while I was stuck with a paid of bosses, one of which was very strict but fair while the other was a moronic jackass who never put in the effort for his own business. I was furious and miserable all the time, but I considered this a long overdue payment for three years of standing around with my thumb up my ass and not giving a shit about my major.

The next year, I was a changed man. I was doing homework the day I got it, overall doing better in classes, putting real effort in the gym so for the first time in my life my shirts felt tight from my muscles, not my flabs, and even made out with 4 girls over the course of the first two months of the year (not much, but I felt like Casanova compared to what I was before). Then the funniest thing happened. You know the rest. The rest of 2020 felt like I was emasculated in multiple ways. Dating was completely out of the question, Econ 4000 classes were hell online, social life drained into occasional zoom calls in the friend group, and the body I built went back to flabs when the only bit of happiness I felt during the day was binging on a snack and trying to tune out half the people in the house screeching at the top of their lungs all day long. But hey, I pulled my ass to the finish line and graduated on time and got an internship for 2021. Shitty year overall, but all’s well that ends well.

Fast-forward to today and I think this might just be the worst year of my life. I’m lucky to say that: I’ve had no deaths in the family nor amongst my friends, and I haven’t suffered irreparable damage. That being said, if 2019 felt like I was paying my dues for not caring enough and 2020 was bittersweet for everything going to shit but still managing to graduate, this year has felt like punishment for trying my hardest at everything. Internship went nowhere despite dedicating 55 hours a week at times to working there (they didn’t even consider not giving me the job and just extending my cheap internship), had to stop going to the gym because the first serious snowfall the city’s had in 50 years ended with me falling on my ass and getting a severely herniated disc (which I’ve had since early February), most friends moved away and a few stopped giving a shit, family relations have been testy because I’ve become a spiteful cunt, and everything I’ve worked towards with my psychologist’s help over the past two years has come undone (what’s worse, all the tools I’ve developed with him to get myself out of these situations are things I can no longer use because of uncontrollable external circumstances). I’m lucky to be getting surgery mid-December, but that’s about the only thing I have left to look forwards to this year.

I think frequently about Tom Segura and Bo Burnham and a similar bit they have. Tom’s (I don’t remember which special) was played more exaggerated and comedically in the way he’s “ready” to be an old man. Bo in Inside had a monologue that hit too close to home: “You should never kill yourself. There’s someone out there who loves you-or not, but there may be someone out there in the future who loves you. But if I could kill myself for, like, a year, then absolutely. Maybe even a year and a half, yeah, that’d be perfect.” I’ve never fantasized about anything as I have about this.

I’ve never thought as much about death as I have these past few months. I can do next to nothing because the consistent back pain doesn’t allow me to think of anything else. Lying, sitting, standing or moving, it’s become a loud, bodily white noise that I still can’t get used to (on that note, I will never judge Dr. House’s bitter, nihilistic attitude again). Every part of this year that I think about, I see how they ended in failure despite the fact that I know I’ve given them my all since the beginning of the year. Hell, any of these things I think I could individually handle, maybe even several at a time, it’s the sensation that by poor luck, it’s all fallen apart simultaneously. 

I’m not suicidal. The times I even consider the notion, my overwhelming existencial fear prevails. And ultimately, I objectively know that there are better days ahead. But Christ, I feel like I’m at the bottom of a pool with weights chained to my legs, and I’m tired of swimming to the top for a brief breath of air before sinking back down again. It won’t last forever, but I’m out of strength.


TL;DR: I try giving a shit for the first time in my life, and it feels like I got punished for it.

depression,Everyday is the same,"Not very good at this and it’s my first post on here,I’ve been battling depression since 25 and I’m 47 now,in the past I’ve used drink and every drug out at the time just to deaden the feelings inside,but I give up booze and hard drugs 16 years ago now but I do still have a puff and on painkillers for spinal injury,which I think helps to some extent also on antidepressants and due to go on antipsychotics soon as my blood test come back,the last few weeks have felt harder than normal,I’m breaking down several times a day and can’t see no light,I feel like I’m stuck in a loop of everyday feels the same except maybe the odd day when I feel on top of the world but it never lasts long,everyone says I’ve gone this far and I can do it but if they felt like I do I don’t think half could do this a year yet alone over 30,my worry is how long can I handle it,a year 2 or ten,then I ask myself is it worth it in the end as we all die anyway,what’s the point in doing this year after year only to pass on depressed,sorry for the wall of text and sorry for putting my negativity out on here,I feel I need to say it"
depression,I have no idea what to do with my life,"I am 20 and have been suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was ~7, but got diagnosed officially on paper two years ago after I couldn’t handle the pressure I was under in school and my teachers helped me out. They noticed that although I‘ve been going to therapy since years, my mental health was worse than ever. They personally drove me to the ER where I got help and was sent to a psychiatric clinic and I‘m still very grateful for that.


Now, two years later I‘m in that state again and don‘t know if my new art school is manageable for me. But back then I needed to break off my second try at the 11th grade too so I can heal and focus on myself. I just don‘t want to break it off again and wait another year to try and continue graduating from high school. It feels like wasting my time although I know I shouldn’t feel like that about it. 

1.5 months ago I caught a cold and my immune system is so weak that I‘m still getting treated for it. So I needed to stay home (with symptoms that could be Covid, one isn’t allowed on the school grounds, even if the test comes back negative) and it feels like slacking.  Additionally, I lost my newly found therapist and my doctor who I was planning the treatment of my endometriosis with and searching for new specialists had no result. 
I don‘t even have enough energy to study for five different tests or to draw the (overwhelming amount of) work I should be handing over this friday. And don‘t get me wrong, as I got the letter this summer that I got accepted, I was so happy I cried. But right now I can‘t even do the things that I loved and kept me going. 
Every doctor I met said that I should be doing some sports, but I can’t, not anymore and not what I‘d like. After 11 years of ballet, both of my ankles were ruined and I got surgery, but I still need to heal for a long time.
So I just can’t find anything to make myself feel better. 


Talking about feeling: I don‘t even know how I feel or what I think. I‘m crying every day about the smallest things and my head is either empty of thoughts or so full that I can‘t even decipher them, but either way it is so overwhelming that I only hear a quiet buzzing in my head. If I didn’t had my partner who is there for me, I would go crazy.

Without graduating, I won’t be able to work as a professional artist and I will disappoint everyone including me. I will throw away another year of my life. Four years for nothing. I don‘t know what to do anymore."

But this i just a disguise, i still feel sad, i don't find joy in my work, free time, what is the point of just spending rest of my life's unhappy? My poor choices and lies that I'm fine will eventually catch up to me and I don't know if I can keep this up. The only reason why I'm still alive is because of my family. Thought of them suffering is worse than my own misery. I'm too scared to talk with anyone close about this, just because i want to be left alone. I don't want others pity or support or worry about how am I. But year after year, I still keep telling my self, this is the time I'll do better. And I'm just tired of lying to my self and others. I'm scared to seek help, I'm scared to take on responsibility, I'm scared to confront anyone. Somehow for years I've been able to keep how depressed I am and how anxious I am about everything in my life. Just needed to rant somewhere since I haven't talked about this with anyone."

depression,Sometimes i dont feel real,I've never really thought much on my mental state till recently in life. I am only 20 but for almost my whole life i have ignored my mental state. I wonder about who i am at heart. How come i do not feel things for others. I wonder will i cry if someone i know passes away. At this point in time i think i could not cry but the thought of that makes me feel uneasy. I really cant cry on my own something always needs to push me over. I am not diagnosed with anything but depression runs in my family and i do have a therapist. It feels hard to get anywhere due to how much i do not remember from when i was younger. Even recent memory i barely can remember i dont know if that has anything to do with depression but it weighs on my mind. I think so much it feels like a curse that cant be lifted. Anxiety creeps up when i realize im enjoying myself and it just causes me to get really bored with whatever im doing. Idk im getting that bored feeling now so this is it.

I’m trans, brains worrying about holy shit I don’t look like the men and I’m sorta chubby too not hugely so just like 20 lbs  due to stress eating so I feel even crapper and uni deadlines are scary. But I can’t stop doing education because if I did that my child pension that I’m living in from my dad would stop.  And I’m sorta left feeling depressed and crappy and unmotivated. 

have a partner who I love and it’s a healthy relationship and all the rest but because. I kept on messing up during sex last night Like small mistakes that everyone makes, or even just things. Like I can’t help. I wanted to cry, like I don’t know what I can get to have my libido come back a bit.  But like yeah. Shit like last night keeps it down and,  I feel evil for being like that I say sorry when I don’t feel able to have sex and what not.

She sometimes doesn't even remember she left things in the oven, etc. She says ""I don't know who you are, but what I do know is I love you."" Makes me almost cry hearing her say it. She asks ""is that car still giving [mom] trouble?"" Shes been dead for over 4 years. Someone has to inform her, and when she is, she bursts into tears and then in a couple minutes, she forgets, and stops crying. And my father beats me and says ""if you tell anyone, I will kill you."" Luckily he doesn't know my reddit account. Even though he beats me, I still love him no matter the circumstance. My step-mom also hates me, but not the same as my dad does. I've been taking beatings from him for god knows how fucking long. I'm so tempted to grab a knife and slit their throats while they sleep, or do it to myself. I've moved away from them though. And my roommate will ask me about the scars on me. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want her to know. My grandmother is the only thing keeping me from killing myself, and she's eventually going to die. I haven't ate in a while either. Or slept. I'm completely dead inside. I don't know if I can endure this torture any longer."

I want to brush my teeth, eat healthy, exercise, keep my room clean, do the dishes, go to work, socialise, but the thought of having to do it every day for the rest of my life is extremely daunting. I'm tired enough all the time without doing these things, I waste my day enough without putting time into these things, where do I fit in the time and energy? I can't keep living the way I am but I can't see myself doing these self-care things every day, forever either. 

I managed to brush my teeth for the first time in weeks and it doesn't feel like a victory at all, because I know I won't have the energy or effort in me to brush them again tomorrow, let alone twice a day, forever."

depression,"Yeah I'm not sure anymore. I'm too sensitive over everything, I just can not function properly on my own.","It's the same thing everyday, all I do is stay inside, try to do my hw(though I skip classes tons), try to draw, then sleep for like 10 hours or more, and just waste away at the end of everyday. I want to try. I wanted to try. I decided that I wasn't going to college, then I started to think about giving it a chance though it would have to be community college, and I don't even have the money to go there. Even then what would I study? I'm already a senior in highschool, been hopeless the entire 4 years here. Then I started to panic 
I panicked because even if I planned it out and seemed well maybe I'd never even go along with it which is so sad. It always makes me cry because I can never go along with things. Even when I plan them ahead of time. I feel physically and mentally incapable of doing any of this because I go into a rollercoaster of hope of planning things out and saying ""this time I really will try"" and then I start feeling such detrimental pain it gets unbearable because I know I really can't. I don't know why I can't I'm just stupid and useless. There's things I like and enjoy but I never can enter a field like that because I wouldn't be able to handle the stress.
I mean I can't even do simple commissions for art and that's my only talent. It doesn't help that when I turned 17 I was barely starting to appreciate being in school and then I realized 
I'm about to be a legal adult, my parents are going to expect more from me, I spent middleschool and highschool being stressed out because I've just been suffering so much from depression and trauma, and now that I was starting to heal from that my brain won't have time to process it because it's time to grow up. Does that make sense?..
 God I'm so tired and sad. 2 days ago I was thinking about maybe trying to read more and focus more on science or stuff or maybe study some mortician stuff, but I can't. The cycle just happened again and now I feel miserable and hopeless because I'll probably never get out of this endless loop of misery. 
My life isn't terrible or anything it's just that, I can never process things properly, or do things properly. I've become so lazy and I can't function at all anymore. Now it's so hard. I don't even procrastinate anymore, I just don't even do anything at all.
I couldn't even go through getting a part time job for the meantime. I'm afraid of becoming a neet but maybe I'm just that miserable that I'll let myself become one till I die or something. I don't have anyone to talk to about this either because if I have a conversation it will make me feel worse or like they don't understand, and they fmight but it won't fix anything. Strangers and close friends still say the same thing and they can't do anything about it because this is just a me problem that I need to learn how to fix on my own"

depression,I can't do or feel anything,"Hello guys,
I'm dealing with a problem, maybe it's not a big one, but I want to confess it to someone. I started realizing that I'm not passionate about anything and I do the daily activities just like a ""to do list"", here including: watching series, looking at videos on Youtube. I do them and I don't feel anything : no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, it's just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

I literally spend all my day wasting time in my bed, scrolling on Facebook, thinking : ""what if I would did the things better in the past?"", without energy and with some suicidal thoughts, to cut off completely the situation I'm going through.


Everytime I try to memorize something about history, politics, geography, actors, etc. , literally anything, I feel I force myself to remember that and it's such a hard thing.

This memorizing process affects me even when I'm on the street or in any situation : ""Have you noticed that sign or that store?"", ""Do you remember that that person  wore a red dress, right?"". No, I don't remember these details.

I'm just lost in this whole target wind : passions, dreams, getting a gf, future plans (I don't have any and I don't feel I can make any) and I feel like an empty vase without feelings.

Also I know I have no talent at anything and everything seems forced.

I have to mention it's not depression, because I took meds who worked both as anxiolitics and antidepressants and they didn't work in my case.

Any suggestions for my problem?"

depression,Would taking medication for mental illness make you less able to cope with your condition after stopping your doses compared to before you had ever taken medication?,"Say for example John has crippling depression. John went 6 years without taking medication and fighting depression alone with no assistance. He has become used to the pain in a sense but it still ruins his life in all sorts of ways. Then, one day, John decides to seek help from a professional and begins taking antidepressants for a couple years. They make him cope better, but for whatever reason, John decides to stop taking his antidepressants (the reason does not matter). Would John be less able to cope with his depression now since he became used to having the aid of medication and now is suddenly alone and without help again? Ignoring specific life circumstances and simply focusing on the depression; would he be at an even higher risk of suicide compared to before since he isn't used to this level of pain anymore and it came back so quickly and suddenly? Or would he simply revert to how he was before the medication and can get by the same as back then?"
depression,Plans...,"Usually I wouldn't be so upset over something so minor, but lately I've been very irritable. All week I was planning on going to a haunted house with my friend.

I’ve always been invisible and guys I just can’t do it anymore.

I just want kids and a family, to be accepted.

It’s not an option for me though.

But god fucking forbid I send a bullet through my throat cuz then a handful of idiots who care about me would have their worlds ruined

depression,“Things happen for a reason”,"Maybe not. 

What did I do to deserve this ? 

Give me a reason why living is so hard."
depression,I sexually assaulted my younger cousin but at the same time did not.,"This all started when I was 12 years old, I used to always go to my uncle’s house like every week or so. He has three daughters one of them being 17, the other being 15 and the youngest being 9. 

I remember I used to love playing games with my cousins like tag and many other childish games. So sometimes I used to play these kinds of games with my younger cousin which is 9 right now but was 7 at the time. 

It was all fine and we used to have fun till one day, I felt being touched. Now I was very stupid as a child, I thought she did it on purpose but in reality she did it by accident. The problem was I was holding her arm when she did that so I’m scared that when she grows up she will think I forcefully pulled her arm and put it on my genital. 

This is not the main problem though, I remember right after I felt being touched I went and touched her in the same area I got touched, yes. Now at that time I did know what a vagina was, but I thought it was located somewhere in the butt because ever since I was growing up my mom used to tell me that girls pee from their butts.

I remember my younger cousin twerking a lot on my face without me knowing and it kind of feels weird but I’m not that bothered with it since she was a child and didn’t really understand it was wrong. I used to always tell her, “ stop twerking, you don’t know to do it.” Because I thought this would make her stop but I realized that the more I used to say it the more she would do it. So I stopped saying it and caring. 

When we used to play these games I also realized that I would always be behind her so it used to look like I was dry humping her or rubbing it on her. But again, when I used to do this I didn’t have a deep brain about sexual activity so I just kept on with it and thought it was normal.

A few months after this happened I remember playing a game which involves taking the phone from each other. She took my phone and ran around with it and then we she got tired she was standing near the bed bending over. When I saw that she was using my phone and spamming random passwords I rushed to take it from her immediately. I stood behind her and bent over to take the phone from her hand, and when I took it I quickly opened it and checked it. While I was checking it I noticed she was twerking on me, so I remember pushing her and I got angry and yelled at her. And by the way, this was after my mind developed sexually.

I don’t blame it on her, even If I was doing all this stuff while not being aware I take full responsibility for my stupidity and lack of knowledge even if I was only 12 years old. I realized that most children would exposed to porn before being 12 and I shocked and anxious because I know this could be used against me. When I was 12 I indeed did know what sex was but I never had a deep mind about it because i only saw a couple of sex scenes which only involved kissing in bed without showing nudity. I also used to watch kissing pranks before i was 12 but this doesnt really have an effect on what i did since its just kissing.

I also remembered grabbing her ass while she was twerking on my face as a joke, because some videos i used to watch on the internet involved this stuff and really thought of it as jokes. some examples of these videos involved jake paul and logan Paul. And as a kid I remember it was so easy to manipulate me, for example whenever I used to watch something I would end up doing the same actions  in the videos. 

I just turned 14 last week and for the past 2 months I've been feeling sad and afraid. I'm sick of it, I'm sick of faking my smiles with my friends and family. I'm very afraid of what will happen with my future, more importantly to my cousin's future because I know that she will one day realize this and think I'm a bad person because it looked like i was fully aware of what I was doing. I plan on apologizing to my cousin in the future, but I'm afraid that she won't believe me and I would later be portrait as a bad person. 

And to finish this story, I deeply apologize to every single person who are victims of sexual assault and rape. I just want to let all of you know that it's not your faults and you guys are kings and queens. So please keep your heads up. Goodbye and have a good day."

I dont have any energy to do anything in my day.

Between work and my excessive sleeping the few hours left in my day i spend it on social media and netflix.
Again i had this problem since my early teens years."
depression,why do I feel like this,"I know so many people with divorced parents, just big family problems in general. I have good grades, good parents,friends gave been, well...meh. But something is not right. (TW:SH discussion)
Right now I feel like everything should be fine. But something says otherwise. 
In the first quarantine, shit hit the fan. My dad was working abroad so my mom was alone with my sisters. It was awful, if she wasn't in the mood for even eating, no one would, I'd have to make dinner for my sisters out of scraps. If she felt bad, everyone would. During that period, my sh got worse, Id use it as a reward for finishing assignments and so on. It was hard on everyone, she acted like it was only for her, when I would be the one to clean up her mess. In a sense she was right, but only to a small extent.
In April (2020) she noticed my cuts. She looked me in the eyes and told me she would check on me everyday to make sure I wouldn't do it anymore (never admitted it, I just told her a lame excuse but there was no chance of hiding at that point). She never did. I realized she doesn't care, neither does my dad. If grades are good and we are respectful, shit is great.
It has been a long time since then, my parents act like everything is perfect. I have been clean for seven months but it'll reset soon. I don't know why. I feel like this period of time is what affects me the most but idfk why and it's frustrating. Almost as if I want to be sad."
depression,suffering for the possibility of a better future,"I’ve felt like dogshit for years. I go to a very conservative school in a pretty conservative town and ever since I came out as transgender my mental health has only gotten worse. I am constantly being misgendered, people harass me by calling me slurs or being generally transphobic and stuff like that has been only getting worse. At this point I’m worried it will keep escalating - in my county half of all reported hate crimes came from my town, the majority of which were on the basis of being LGBT, and we dont know the real number cause most lgbtq ppl in my town are scared of the cops. I don’t even really know why I’m attending school or working so hard on my assignments. I tell myself I’m going to school because I want to have a job I love and that I go through all this pain everyday because I want to know things will get better, but what will I do if it doesn’t get better? what if I hate life later just as much as I hate it now? Even if I did enjoy life later, would all the pain I’m in now even have been really worth it? Even if I did enjoy life later, I will still be broken. I don’t even have any close friends at the school, only one person I talk to online. I am in therapy, and my therapist is good but my parents have forced me to see him biweekly instead of every week (not because we have to we can afford to see him every week). I’m extraordinarily fortunate I can see him at all, but it would be a lie to say that its isn’t effecting me a lot. I tried to take his advice and talk to my online friend about what I’m going through, but even if I get as far as mentioning it to him, I never truly talk about whats going on since I try to turn all of the bad experiences I have into a joke. All fo this pain has no meaning. This pain will probably never be worth it in the end, but I can’t kill myself do to my younger siblings so I may just be like this for a very long time.

I want to attempt again because idk. I don't want to do all this shit anymore. 

My mum thinks im faking it? telling her I want to die//will kill myself for fun or something? I don't know. 

If your kid has never taken off his hoodie in 3 YEARS, constantly says they want to die, if you find bloody plasters dotted around, you're seriously not going to care? That doesn't say anything? 
But she yells at me when I dont eat, and once I refused food and she started yelling at me.

Tbh i really don't care if she gives a shit. I just want some fucking help. But hey, you can't get any help!! Let alone make anyone believe that my problems are real. Because when it does come to professionals, like my youth worker, I CANT TELL HIM ANYTHING! Because then he has to tell my mum. She clearly doesn't care. But? idk. I can't speak to professionals, i don't know what to say.

Anyway you can't get help! 


i don't know what to do anymore because i'm so tired of everything. I don't *want to die* it just want all of this shit to stop!

I am nihilistic. I don't think anything matters and I have a very depressing outlook on life.

It's rare, but there are people I share with the twisted and dark depths of my mind with, and I do love them and they love me. Most of the time I find a common ground and that my thoughts are shared among many more people than I thought.

depression,Partner is depressed and I can't fix it,"I know I am not supposed to fix her but it hurts so much to see her in her own misery.

On the weekends her emptiness shows the most. She wants to find something worth the time but instead finds nothing to do. She has little projects she wants to do but when the moment comes she does not want to do it anymore. If that makes any sense, sorry I am not a native speaker.

Like, we love to watch birds and she got a nice little birdhouse for our balcony and she has to apply a protection layer for the wood to it and put it out there. She looks every week at it and says this weekend I am gonna do it but then she can't get to the point of starting.

I know I could help her and do stuff for her but the problem is she wants to have her own energy to do this.

I did this mistake so many times, to try to do these things for her and she is usually happy with the outcome when things got done but the core problem of her not knowing what she wants to do and bringing the energy up to do if she finds it, is still there.

These pandemic times are not doing her a favour as well.

We moved shortly before the pandemic started to a new town and making friends is really hard when you are a couple in your late 20s, at least for us. 

Right now we planned to go to Ikea with a friend that comes from our old town but she only lies on the couch and turns around when I enter the room. I hope she finds the motivation to get up and come with us.

She deserves so much better like all of you in this sub. She has bright green eyes and lovely brown hair. I admire her and love her in a way I can't describe with words. But not only that, she is my best friend and sometimes we both get to our limits and I feel like breaking down and I just can and she holds me when I cry and let it all out. 

This is so crazy, she gives me so much strengths and I am glad if I can just give her a fraction of it back. 

I just had to write it down once, thank you if you read all this personal shit about my life lol"
depression,Feeling stuck and lost,"It’s like I’m doing everything that I’m meant to do or all that’s the norm. Yet, happiness and being okay eludes me. Tbf im alone so that probably has something to do with it lol. I spent pretty much all day Wednesday just doing integrals for class and for fun. I don’t ever really do that but I got nothing else so why not? This lost its direction, more of a ramble now. I took a few edibles (rare for me) and dam I got so paranoid. I kept thinking so much I had to lay still and it got even more sad. It’s the same thing. Work, school, eat, sleep and repeat."
depression,I don’t know I’m just sharing pls be nice,"I was never medically diagnosed with depression therefor I don’t claim that I have illness but since I was 13 tried to kill myself twice, luckily I survived. 

A little background about me: 
When I was born my existence was already denied by my fathers side whole family for a factor that I cannot control. I was born with the religion of Christianity and my fathers family didn’t like my mother thus growing the hate on me aswell. 
Growing up Being denied to family gatherings that my half sister (father side) can attend to was a regular for me. I would also always get bullied by my half sister (father side) and my brother (mother side) on a regular, the home bullying was regular for me I would get my ass kicked and suffer regular black eyes and bloated face and bloody nose from my brother, and he would always tell me that their life got worse when I was born. 
In school aswell I didn’t make any friends for the fear that my classmates would hurt me to. All of my elementary years I would also get bullied thrown into a corner for I did not speak often. Beatings insults are a daily occurrence, it also didn’t help that my father became a drunkard and would fight my mother almost every night and would become progressively abusive.
Reaching the age 13 I would become scared to trust I would use art and video games to escape, but it eventually problems caught up. For my tiny heart back then I cannot handle the stress thus resulting into my first attempt, I would try to hang myself but luckily failed due to I didn’t know how to set the noose up without being seen by others as I was a kid and didn’t know much.

Before my second attempt I would find one of my first best friends, a dog abandoned by a broken family. I would talk to him on a regular about my struggles and would receive kisses from him he elevated my and made me happy in the darkest days of my life, but sadly he parted away due to an illness that was not diagnosed till it was too late.

depression,I am not sure if I depression,"I was never medically diagnosed with depression therefor I don’t claim that I have illness but since I was 13 tried to kill myself twice, luckily I survived. 

A little background about me: 

When I was born my existence was already denied by my fathers side whole family for a factor that I cannot control. I was born with the religion of Christianity and my fathers family didn’t like my mother, thus growing the hate on my existance aswell. Growing up Being denied to family gatherings that my half sister (father side) can attend to was a regular for me. I would also always get bullied by my half sister (father side) and my brother (mother side) on a regular, the home bullying was regular for me I would get my ass kicked and suffer regular black eyes and bloated face and bloody nose from my brother, and he would always tell me that their life got worse when I was born. 

In school aswell I didn’t make any friends for the fear that my classmates would hurt me to. All of my elementary years I would also get bullied thrown into a corner for I did not speak often. Beatings insults are a daily occurrence, it also didn’t help that my father became a drunkard and would fight my mother almost every night and would become progressively abusive.

Reaching the age 13 I would become scared to trust I would use art and video games to escape, but it eventually problems caught up. For my tiny heart back then I cannot handle the stress thus resulting into my first attempt, I would try to hang myself but luckily failed due to I didn’t know how to set the noose up without being seen by others as I was a kid and didn’t know much.

Before my second attempt I would find one of my first best friends, a dog abandoned by a broken family. I would talk to him on a regular about my struggles and would receive kisses from him he elevated my and made me happy in the darkest days of my life, but sadly he parted away due to an illness that was not diagnosed till it was too late. The event of losing him took me back to the same old buried in sadness I felt before I met him but this time it was more painful. 2 months of losing him and being on the same position after having him I would try to hang my self again but luckily failed due to my mother seeing the noose set up and removing it.

depression,Hit a new low,"4.5 years of depression. Finally cut myself for the first time today. It’s crazy how life turns out, I used to think slitters and self harmers were stupid cause I didn’t understand their mentality, but here I am today. Life always goes the same, all day every day. Have school all 7 days of the week due to some prep courses I’m enrolled in, yet I still feel behind in life. I just want a break.


As for how it felt, it felt like being pressed by a cup of hot water. Gave 50-60 slashes before blood finally showed up and I penetrated my skin. The first one was painful, but the rest hurt less and less. 

As for why I did this, I struggle showing emotions outwardly, I usually feel them inside intensely, for the first time it felt like I released them outside, vented to the world, and got validation I was actually depressed and need help and that it wasn’t my mind tricking me into thinking I was depressed. That’s probably why this isn’t going to be the last time I do this."
depression,I turned my emotions off,"Now I don't feel a thing. Idk how, but it actually worked. Now I can do anything. Someone want to know how to?"
depression,Passively Suicidal,"I am not actively suicidal, i would not commit suicide the main reason being i feel selfish and who am i to cause trauma to my friends or family, even if I don't have a good relationship with them. I am not worth peoples energy after i die, so i stay. This doesn't mean death isn't constantly on my mind. Wishing I wasn't born or that people leave me alone so i could end it or that I just don't wake up. Its exhausting. Nobody knows what's going on in my head, and when i am alone I always just go out and search for drugs to occupy myself. I have no goals or passions, and no desire to grow up. I am so tired and emotionally alone. I am always there for everyone , go the extra mile, at least i can prove myself that i am a good person, but isnt that also egoistic as i am doing it to please my low self worth but also except the same back, which i never get."

depression,I don’t wanna wake up tomorrow,"It’ll be great if I don’t. I don’t wanna kill myself cuz I’m too much of a pussy, I just wanna die somehow. I know I sound stupid, but it’s literally the only thing on my mind."
depression,Reality Check Moment,"What’s up Reddit, I am currently a sophomore in college and am someone who has dealt with life long depression. I was on the verge of committing suicide last spring and was on the verge of trying again last week. I’m an extremely good student (3.95 gpa) and some would say I have almost everything going for me. I am a pretty introverted and socially awkward person so I am pretty lonely up here and barely interact with others. 

When I got to school I reconnected with a girl I have been off and on with over the summer and we began to talk and hangout almost everyday during this semester. Things recently fell off and only became worse when I told her I almost attempted to commit suicide. I got off the phone with her a little bit ago and she told me that I was too “emotional” and too “different” from her and that we could never be together because of this. She seemed to not have an understanding of what depression can do to someone and proceeded to call me selfish and said she had lost respect for me for even contemplating suicide. Although, I found much of what she said to be ignorant, she did say that I do a lot of this to myself by often not even attempting to better my own situation, such as trying to be more social and such. I found this facet of what she said to be something that was very true. It made me realize that I had so often given up in the face of my depression and often basked in my own sadness and spent more time feeling sorry for myself than taking action. 

So to conclude, I was wondering if she is truly right about this facet or conversely, it’s just another ignorant sentiment. I also would like to hear your thoughts about it she is a person worth keeping in my life or should I let her go."

depression,Any advice on how to keep interest in things alive?,"Hi everyone. I'd like to request a piece of advice. 

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and cyclothymia 2 years ago and since then, I've been on substantial dozes of sertraline and lamotrigine (stating this to give a fuller picture of my situation, and NOT to promote these meds). 

Every now and then, through some cracks in the train of numb and dull days, I get glimmer of interest in things, like drawing or going for a run. However, they die out very, very quickly, and I am back in the pit. I am sure that a lot of people here experience the same. I hope some have found ""hacks"" of how to keep the interest alive for a little longer than few hours, or maybe make them happen more often than once a month. Would you mind sharing your experience and thoughts on that? I would deeply appreciate it.

PS - I apologize if this is a silly question. I am also sorry if my post isn't clear: English is not my native language."
depression,"Yep, life is pointless.","I think it’s safe to say that for most people on this planet, life is for the most part a bit of a struggle and at best, fairly dull and spent going through the motions. At worst, life can be an everyday fight for survival. My life is OK relatively speaking - I’ve had an education and have a fairly decent job, food, shelter, etc. I didn’t ask to be born and honestly wish I hadn’t been, but here I am. To me this seems like the only rational way to see things. I’ve accepted the pointlessness of life and I don’t fear death; when my time is up fair enough. I’m assuming lots of people on here think this way, but has anybody got any tips or suggestions for making the most of life? Is it maybe all about helping others or something? I have social anxiety so I don’t have a wide circle of friends, so feel quite lonely a lot of the time."

depression,Can someone help me find the reason not to take my life...,"

I am 30yo female, diagnosed with depression 3 years ago. Taking 10mg escitalopram, never tried therapy as I don't think it would help me. 

I am a freelancer, graduated from uni, I can earn enough to sustain life. I eat well. 

I just figured what is the point of working and living? I am not getting any younger, and my soul is dying day by day. I have hobbies and interests but these are just time wasters and I don't enjoy them as much as I used to. I am single, been dealing with rejection my whole fucking life. I am always the second-best in everything I do. My biological clock is ticking, and even I were to miraculously form a family I doubt I would have the strength to carry it out. 

I don't care about staying alive for my friends and family, as I am sure they will get over it at some point as they are way stronger than I am. Maybe I will live until my 5 yo cat dies, I couldn't bear to leave him without care and love.  

The thought of death seems like such relief. 

It's hard being in my head. I don't have the strength to push forward anymore for my silly job and my silly life and my silly friends and my silly everything. Everything I do, the work, the hobbies and whatever just seem to be an escape. The moment I am still it all comes back..."

depression,My biggest regret in life,"When I was 19-20 I used to go on the unmoderated Omegle for hours and hours to jerk off for a total of 6 months.I have easily masturbated with over 500-600 women on there. I also used to record every encounter I had on there. It was a habit, as soon as I saw a naked woman I pressed the record button and started masturbating. The worst part was when on 4-5 instances the girl told me she was 15-16 and my impulsive reaction was to press record because it was a naked person. I was so consumed by hours spent beforehand on the site getting horny that my brain just shut down. Then after 3-4 minutes I would see her face or some other indicator that would make me realise she was actually underage and I would leave the chat, or the girl would leave herself. In both cases I deleted the recording after and never kept any of them. 2 years from that I am seeing a therapist but I still get severe anxiety and depression that no one will forgive me for this and accept me into their lives. I am lost."
depression,"""I'd never guess you have depression!""","""I'd never guess you have depression!"" 

Yeah. Because rules of society demand that I show my best self. Because I am scared you wouldn't understand. Because I am ashamed of myself. Because I don't want to be a burden. Because words mean nothing to me, so I can tell you funny stories and say how everything is amazing. Because I don't want you to try to fix me. Because my thoughts are not written on my face. Because I work from home, and you don't see me cry as I wake up. You don't see my scars from self-harm. You don't see that I sleep for 16 hours a day. You don't see me taking 5 pills every morning. You don't see my daily breakdowns. You don't see *me*.

But now, I told you. Because I am tired. Because I have nothing to lose. Because I want you to stop asking questions and leave me alone. Because I don't care what you do or don't understand. Because I *am* a burden. Because *nothing* means anything to me, not only words. Because my actions reveal my thoughts. Because I have to go to office now, and you'll see my red eyes. You'll see that my clothes is dirty. You'll see me smoking a pack per day, as I try to pull myself together. You'll see that my life is a dumpster on fire. 

So now, you don't have to ""guess""."
depression,why am i still unhappy,"i feel like my life rn is as perfect as it could ever be but i still feel so dull and empty and lifeless. i’ve recovered so much and i get such good grades and have great friends and everything is going amazing but every weekend or every time i’m free i feel so emotionless and empty and literally no kind of joy. i don’t want the rest of my life to be like this. honestly i miss the times when i was super depressed and had a xanax addiction and cried myself to sleep every night because that felt comfortable atleast, i could feel something then even if it was bad and i didn’t mind trying to escape my life by constantly taking xanax and sleeping 20 hours a day. now i have priorities and things to keep up with (i did before too i just never cared about them before) but now i actually keep up with these things and i’m at the top of my class and i’m pretty and i have a good friend group i just don’t understand why i’m not happy at all. like what do i even do at this point, atleast it made sense when i was an addict and had no life, it made sense for me to feel how i felt but i can’t feel at all now and it’s so stupid. shit like this makes me feel how i’m the only flaw in my life, i have such a good life and i’m the one who can’t enjoy it. people are gonna say some stupid shit like ‘do more of what you enjoy doing’ but there’s literally nothing that’s going me joy anymore. i know it’s depression but i don’t understand why, or how to stop it or end it. i don’t wanna take antidepressants because that shit will make me more numb and i think i’m just gonna power through and forget about being happy for the sake of keeping up my life."

We chatted and within a month, we became really good friends...but as we became closer they were able to spot my...flaws. One of which is that I get really attached to ppl I meet. (Anyone like me?) I'm not sure if it's because I'm traumatized by what happened to me in the past. (The bullying. The isolation. The lack of friends). It drove me into depression for several years and almost suicidal. I (think?) I'm getting better? But I'm not sure. 

Now when I meet new friends online....I get really attached...especially if they are relatable. Im...desperate. The fear of losing them plagued my mind. In fact I treated them almost like my siblings...They were....accepting of me and my flaws. And I felt....loved. 

Now the issue comes in. They're like really young(minors) and I'm 21.  So whenever I express my ""love"" in some public servers... some found it creepy... (Saying hearing their voices give me hope, and I wish to make them happy). I genuinely meant that. I was...in a dark place...their voices gave me strength to carry on. And I always tried to appease them..buy them gifts and such. Like an older sibling would :] 

I'm not like that. I ain't....one of those creeps/pedos. Ugh.  I just....had no purpose in my life. Felt no reason to live...until I met them. I want to take care of them...like how an older sibling does. I never had siblings...I just hate it that its considered wrong and creepy to love your online friends. Like....the age shouldn't matter. But it does. And one should be very careful about the way they speak....sigh."

depression,I never been treated so unfairly throughout my life before,"This will be a long story, my apologies! And yes, SIMP alert, just to put it out here.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok it is all started with this girl who is my crush, turns out she's a manager of her company and she's looking for someone to hire. So I step in and wanted to do a marketing role which she agreed to. We helped each other and she even said she was thankful that I was there helping her because we're already short of manpower on an overloaded task set by our boss (which is her mother). Fast forward, one of the employee quit because he can't take it anymore because our boss being an asshole towards him. So since we're running low on manpower, i volunteer to take that ex-colleague role which is retail/bakery/storekeeper for the time being while my manager plans to hire someone else. But ... she didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months pass by, and I'm having trouble doing multiple tasks here in this job. Not only I'm doing task that is way out of my jobscope, but I'm also having to do Overtime DAILY with only one-off day and no pay increase. Ok, not asking for a pay increase is my fault to be honest because I volunteer to stay back only because my manager stays back. Since no one is there to help her, I have to stay back so I don't mind doing it without any overtime pay. However, she seems to pick on me alot. Scold me whenever I couldn't get the job done that was assigned by her but the problem is, THERE ARE SO MUCH THINGS TO DO. And things not even on my jobscope.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up to her and she said she ""understand"" so she hired another person but that person is doing the role that I WAS INITIALLY signed up for. Instead of hiring retail/bakery/storekeeper, she hired a marketer which is what I was supposed to do. I was abit upset with this and I brought up this issue again and she said ""she understand"". I still like her very much so my anger towards her kind of depleted. But... she didn't actually do anything, as a matter in fact, she and her boss keeps scolding me of the things I did by a small mistake or not even my doing, yes I'm getting blamed for stuff that is NOT my doing. But then again, it is because of her I stayed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been like this for 8 long months, And I can't handle it anymore because of all the unfairness that i've been getting. That one final scold from boss which is by far the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced, I quit and my manager kinda cried. But I did promise her that I will try to help her behind the scenes, in regards of marketing (and this will also prove to her that I  can help her do this role which I promised to). Things go smooth actually, but then she suddenly just changed the password of the company which I kinda needed to continue her work. She didn't even notify me, so i texted her and she just drop the ball on me saying I'm no longer working in the company because boss don't want me to work with her behind the scenes. She could have told me earlier instead of me wasting my time?. But that's not the suckiest part...

&amp;#x200B;

This is the suckiest part that makes me WANT TO KILL MYSELF, One of our colleague got forced to do a task outside of his jobscope and just for one day, he complains. AND MY MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND STARTS TO PANIC. She apologize to him and said she learnt her lesson, as a matter in fact, she even plan to increase his pay. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? all these time of me working my ass off for 8 months doing multiple task that isn't my jobscope, being in Overtime DAILY with only one off day and this is what i get? no payment increase, no nothing?? And now I have no job, I was planning to be graphic designer which I'm working on my portfolio very hard for it, and now I have to rush finding a job, my plans to be a graphic designer have to put on halt and the worst of it all, I am still livid about all of this situation. She just living her life as per normal treating her colleagues with fairness while she shit on me. And I want to bring this up to her as my one final moment.. should I do it? I can't live with myself how I got screwed over and now I feel helpless. And I like her, she even said she used to like me. This whole thing sucks, I am so angry about the situation but I'm not fully angry with her. What is wrong with me? what should i do?"
depression,New friends + depression,"Just don’t mix… hate trying to explain to people that I will eventually become a hermit and not respond to any messages. Wish I could take a break from having responsibilities. I’m so tired. No advice needed, just venting."
depression,I’ve never felt this way before and I need someone to tell me what I can do this is the first time I’ve ever felt this immense sadness and I think it’s here to stay,I recently was told very shocking news that I can’t or never will get the chance to get over ( I will not say because it’s still not real to me writing it out makes this whole situation real so I’m sorry). My uncle and I are the only ones who know and he told me not to tell anyone but it’s eating me inside I need someone to talk to but I don’t have anyone to turn to. I’ve cried so much that my eyes are hurting. All I have been thinking about is why. So many thoughts are running through my brain. I want to be thankful for my girlfriend my family my situation up until this point but it’s so hard right now. Please help me I need something anything to help me feel better. I can’t get my crying to stop even now Im still crying like I just started hours ago. I know that I’ve been a terrible person and maybe what im going through is justice or karma but I really need someone to tell me something to make this all make sense.
depression,I am stuck in a loop,"Since young I have been bullied.  How I am fat and indian  and it apparently was a problem to others. Everyday I get bullied,  for how I look. My mom used to do my hair with coconut oil, which was smelly for them. The food I brought were smelly for them. I looked ugly to them, like a alien. 

Throughout my 7-18 years of age I have been bullied everyday. They would throw sugar on me, steal my stuff, one time a girl kept smacking me on my head with a toy knife right in front of the teacher and I couldn't do anything. I just sat there and counted how many time she smacked me. 

After I turned 18 I needed to take a diploma of my liking by this point I was sad, did not know what to do, where to go, no dreams, no friends. From the day my school ended I just kept sleeping everyday. Usually teens will be hanging out with friends and working. But I was not able to do that. 

Eventually Got into a diploma that I did not like but still went ahead cause I finally escaped hell. Towards the start of the diploma I started feeling optimistic and motivated. It was like suddenly I was feeling all better. I decided to start afresh and I was actually able to do it. Well for the 3 years of diploma I aced everything, I had friends,  made study groups joined 4 different extra curriculums. I was able to concentrate and focus. I lost a ton of weight. I was in some Leadership positions. 


After I graduated I became depressed. I felt  the friends I has were not real. My diploma was in waste, I was a failure in every thing I do. I deleted all pics of me because I hated the way i looked. Stayed in bed all day and  cried. Did not go for any gathering or meetups. So my friends just stopped asking after a certain point. 


At this point I am completely alone, depressed, lonely and I did not know what to do next. work? or degree? I felt like I was wasting time. I didn't want stay like this. Forced myself to apply for all universities and potential  internships. I got both internship and acceptance but I was not jumping for joy. I knew I was depressed. I thought if I just jumped in all will work out fine. Once I am done I will be happy. 

To keep myself  busy I took both worked and did part time degree. I was wrong, I thought I would be happy but I became  more depressed, lonely and stressed. Numb to my feelings, I started to eat more. By my 2nd year in uni I was diagnosed  with diabetes. Fell into the spiral, did not have focus or motivation. Cried every night to sleep tries to harm myself by cutting my hand and hit myself several  times in the head to stop everything. Several times I wanted to die. I wanted to kill my self. 

None of which no one else knows because I hid everything from my family and colleagues. Because I was stubborn to not tell  anyone. Working on assignments till early morning but I won't  be able to sleep and I finally get to bed. Started to worry about everything and developed anxiety. I worried about everything. My work, my assignments, my face, my looks, my future, what will happen  if I die now, I was burned out from everything. I kept bottling up. Watched a lot of kdramas and bought a lot of things to cope. But nothing made me feel good. The company  thought I did well and gave me a permanent position. I did not get happiness  from this. This is where the pandemic hit there world. I started working from home. My concentration  was not there I felll back sometimes. Couldn't  understand lectures. 

When I finally finished my last exam for uni. I felt my body go numb, stayed in bed for 1 week. I took leave and just stayed in bed. After which I started to force my self out of bed and just wander around. By this time the restrictions  were lifted. I went to the mall alone, to the movies alone, walked. Just me and my head phones . I eat a lot during this time too. I hated how fat I looked. By the time I turned 23 I was 100 kg. 

 I had to loose weight because when marriages are arranged they potential  grooms hate fat women like me. Also due to my deteorating health. I kept getting  pain all over my body. 2021 I started my weight loss journey. Everything  became harder. Pulling my self out of bed going for a walk, gym. Till now I am trying. But I keep going in this loop where I will be doing well and there would be a rejection and I lose the motivation  to keep going. 

There was a time where I did not have food for 2-3 days. Other days I will lie and go out and eat everything. I wanted to be away from my home as far as possible for as long as possible because my home has now turned to hell. Everyday my mom and dad would scold me for sitting around. Everyday my mom and dad would point out my parts of my body to say they are fat. My stomach, leg, hands, arms, face, everything. Saying things like ""I know why you dun have friends, because who would be friends with if you are this fat?"", ""everyone is running away from you because you look like that"", "" who would want a elephant for a bride"", ""if you are fat now you will never be able to loose weight"" 


All these and several rejections and caused me to go in a loop. I would find some way to pick my self up and work on it. I will be trying my best to move forward. Than I break down when  I hear any comments as written above. Than I have to pick myself again little by little and try again. This has been happening to me since it started.  This is exhausting.

Before I decide to loose weight,  I did not let my depression affect my work or my family. Even though they hurt me, I didn't  speak of it much. But at the start of 2021 till now, I have had some panic attacks, I burst into tears and anger at small unessasary things. My work is also affected, I have not been happy and productive working also, It feels numb. Like I Do not want to do anything anymore. Waking up and brushing my teeth has not been a problem before. But now it takes me the whole morning. Going to the toilet takes time for me also . I keep sitting in my chair worrying  about everything, thinking blank till I feel pain then I realize. I has become worse. 

I see so many people working, being happy  I want to be happy but I am stuck I this loop. Unable move I am exhausted and tired. I have worked hard now I M 85 kg but I aim to be 70 by Dec. I have stuck here for a month now. No interest in anything. 


 This is my 1st time any one knows and I am telling the strangers on the internet."

depression,I hate myself &amp; I’m super s*****al,"I am mad at society and I have so many reasons to be, but right now it’s because I feel like I can’t be good at things. I have this recurring thought that when my depression finally wins, I will make an impact on people that’s not my immediate family. But I really do think it’s nothing short of a fantasy. When the word comes that I’m not here anymore, those that aren’t related to me will have a short period of surprise and a select few may even feel down for a day or so, but then I will fade from their minds forevermore. And it’s very painful to know that I’ve made such a small impact on people that I cared about, regardless of my many efforts. Like I’ve said before, I’m so tired of meaning so little to so many."
depression,"Well, how do you win against yourself ?","Ok so to set the scene, I’ve just entered college but it hasn’t been much all the fun and cool stuff you get told in high school. So I lost most of my friends but struggle to find my place in my studies this year.
I don’t know how to bring this up but basically I’ve been feeling completely empty lately like I have never been and I’m just 18. Like people keep saying go out speak to people make friends, laugh, but I don’t why but I can’t. I feel like people around me don’t understand me or just don’t have the same (idk if it’s the right term but) ""maturity"". So I end up staying alone with my thoughts wich has been a really bad thing these days, overthinking and the lack of sleep due to these thoughts really doesn’t help feeling better. So yeah I was wondering if you guys had any ideas about how to get out of this situation because overthinking and having the feeling of being completely empty and lonely really starts to be hard, it’s like I don’t know who I am anymore and as if I was losing myself.. So yeah any help or advice on what to do is welcome

depression,I fucked up,"Hey, I fucked up for weeks, can’t get myself focused, couldn’t do anything every day. I have no motivation, But feel I need to do something about it all the time.

depression,school,"Hi everyone! I hope you all had a lovely day. Anywho, I’m curious if anyone has any tips for climbing out of a depression-induced homework-hole. Not to say I’m particularly drowning in overdue assignments, I just seem to have a hard time staying on task these days, and find myself quickly overwhelmed. I chose to continue my studies online, and it honestly hasn’t been the easiest (though I 100% prefer it to going back in-person).My energy for it has depleted, and often leaves me feeling drained, and like the work is never done. I’m sure others have felt this way, and am wondering if anyone had any input on the matter/what has worked for you. Anything helps, and all appreciated. Thank you."

I'm finally gonna start doing something productive after 7 months. I just don't know where to start for drawing, what to attempt to draw even. But I'll just have to find a way I guess. I think this is finally going to be the first real step out of my depressive state. I'm finally ready to get better, to stop being a complete failure in life. All I need to do is to start. I might need some tips on improving more though."
depression,"Depression, alcohol, and girls","Yesterday I went to a college party but before that, I had a little bit more than half a bottle of whiskey at a friend's place.
I just wanted to be numb and not have any bad feelings so I could go and talk to girls with ease.
I got drunk and 5 minutes after I went to the party the security guard kicked me out.
My friend called my sister to come and pick me up to take me home.
I went home I sat down and I threw up twice which caused my dad to wake up.
I feel like a fucking disgrace, having my sister and my dad take care of me, and missing the party. And even worse, when I woke up the next day I opened the phone and saw a message from my friend: ""I kissed a girl from poland"" which made me feel a lot worse for some reason.

What I want you to get out of this story is to never try to drink to take away your bad feelings, go to a doctor instead. Also, what separates real men from boys is being able to pick up girls without drinking alcohol."

depression,I don’t feel like crying anymore,"I used to cry quite often, like couple of times a week but for the last maybe 6 months i just suddenly stopped.

Is this normal?"
depression,Things won’t ever get easier,"This sadness is always gonna be creeping up on me. Even if I have a good week, there’s always the expectation of everything crashing and burning onto me. Like a raining cloud over my head. I’m just tired of feeling nothing and everything all the time. How do I even describe it?

Nobody understands around me. Who do I even talk to? No amount of therapy has helped me. It’s been over 10 years. I’m too young to be getting aged by this. 

This depression not only burdens me, but I know it burdens the people around me. The best I can do is try to escape it. Maybe I’ll play guitar today, or bake something to keep my mind off of my own thoughts. Nobody understands me in my life and I’m that sense, I am alone. I feel so defective all the time, I don’t have family or friends close to me. I can’t even reach my goals cuz I’m always in a rut. 

Sometimes the best option feels like going away forever. I’ve thought of running and starting new. Maybe not being here anymore. Sorry for this ramble."

depression,Struggling because of my teeth.,"Im 22 and I didnt start brushing my teeth until about 5 years ago. I started brushing twice a day and flossing every day for the past 2-3 years.

I've had gingivitis on my botton two canine teeth and one or two of my incisors for years.

No matter how much I brush or floss, it hasnt gone away. I've had two different dentists in the past few years and they both just told me to keep brushing and flossing even though thats what I do. i know im doing it correctly because ive watched tons of videos on proper technique.


My current dentist doesnt even mention the gingivitis unless I do. 

For all I know its progressed into periodontitis by now. I asked my current dentist and they said it didnt, but I found it odd that they never measured my gum pockets during any of my visits like my previous dentists did. 


It just feels like im destined to lose my teeth, and like im trying to fight for something that I cant stop.

Im probably making it into a bigger deal than it is but its just really stressful everytime I see my inflamed gums."
depression,Why is hating life so stigmatized?,"When someone is suicidal , it's self implied that one hates themselves.

Why would I hate myself when I did nothing wrong? If life failed me every bit of the way, why should I hate myself?

And may the Lord forgive you if you ever mention you hate life , people will think of you as a sub-human.

Work 50 years to enjoy 11 if you even make it past 30?

Point this out to anyone? You're mentally ill and need your zoloft-lithium-kissmyass-normalpills to take every sense of realism out of you (I do not hate on antidepressants , they helped me too).

Not only do I not belive that I'm mentally ill , I belive that everyone who doesn't hold these beliefs or similar about life are the ones that are mentally ill.

Life is a rat race."

I have 8 months (or worse it may be more)to move to the country I want to start my life but right now i am thinking its not bad to die but I am so weak to do it. I have little hope that I will find happiness again but its been months that nothing good is happening to me. All i ever had was online friends that I wont ever met, who are supportive of my plans but I dont wanna tell them about what I am thinking because i dont want them to think im just lonely or that I need to do something new. So i am here making reddit as my diary."
depression,Needing help/support,"Hi I’ve never posted on here before and just started using the app so forgive me if I do it wrong. Im a 20 year old female junior in college and I am not ok. I have had depressive episodes before but never like this. Usually when I get low I focus all of my energy on school and I really care how my grades are. This time though I cannot care, like I do care but nothing in me gets me out of bed to go to class. I’ve skipped all parties and trips that my friends have gone to for the past 3 weeks because I could tell I was getting to a breaking point. I haven’t been to a single class in a week and a half and missed tons of work and 2 exams. I have been doubling my vyvanse every morning in hopes that it will give me some form of motivation to get up and do even one assignment but it has done nothing. 

Today my roommates told me they are all moving out and I have less than 2 days now to either sign my lease or move for the next school year. All of my friends have already got their situations figured out so I will probably spend my senior year alone in an apartment. For some reason this situation broke me it pushed me over the edge and I’m not holding it together anymore. I am so tired so disappointed in myself so lonely and so embarrassed. 
I am going to drive home to my parents tomorrow and tell them that I need help. I am scared to let them down but I am not ok."
depression,I Hate the Night,"I’m just going through a breakup with a girl who I loved so much, but it just wasn’t healthy for either of us and I felt like I needed to end it. I’ve struggled with being extremely lonely all my life and never really had any friends or in my few friends groups I was the odd one out; the one that walked behind the group on a narrowed sidewalk, you get what I mean, and was always rejected by every girl I’ve ever asked out until this girl I just broke up with, and I’m really struggling with the loneliness now that she’s gone. I have severe anxiety and depression and it makes it super hard to sleep and all I want to do is just text her and call her for the night, even if it’s just one night that I can forget everything that happened just I can relax and sleep well. I know the answer should be obvious, but should I go down the other path?"
depression,My dreams,will always be better than my reality. I wake up and want nothing more than to resume my dream. Even if it had a dark/apocalyptic atmosphere. Take me back
depression,Do you feel like you just let life happen to you?,"I never made something happen to me myself.
I never took control over something in my life.
I never made a real decision.
I never worked for anything.
I never pursued a partner actively.



How do you take control over your life? How do you know what you want or love?
I feel that I will always circle around depression if I do not find the the thing that drives me.
There is no ambition or love for any tasks in me.
I don't know if my hobbies are actual interests or just a mode to pass the time. 
Same as sleeping. I am sleeping so much because it is like getting time over faster.
I could do so much instead!


I am not suicidal, but I feel it would make no difference. A few people would be sad upon my death, but since I am not really living, just existing, it would not make a difference to me I feel.

Still I wish for myself a real life. I want a loving partner and kids (and with 31 it is kind of getting late). I want a real job, not to be abused as a cheap worker. I want to love my hobbies. I want to have a good nights sleep instead of 12 hours of trying to pass the time.
But I nothing enough to really put in any work."
depression,It’s not stopping,"I’m usually able to push through and function and then inevitably wait out the cycle. But it’s just relentless this time around. I can’t do shit at work, I can’t talk to my wife, I can’t play with my kids, I feel like I’m being ran over a fucking cheese grater. This shit is brutal."
depression,I was feeling the most ready I ever felt and still failed miserably,"It’s gonna sound pathetic but, I had my driving exam a few days back, and it was the first time since ever I felt like I could actually achieve something. I felt SO capable. And what you know I made 2 eliminatory mistakes which I NEVER did before. 

Stayed up all night updating for the results as if the Universe was going to change it somehow lol. 

I know failures aren’t that big of a deal, but that’s all I was holding myself onto for the past few months. 

So I do be feeling like utter shit rn. 😂"
depression,😐,I might end this shit soon. I can deal living for nothing. My life has no purpose and at this point I’m just living for other people. I can’t do this no more. All motivation and happiness I had is lost. Idk what to do at this point and I got no one to talk about this shit to.
depression,I dont know anymore,"Im 17 and its my last year in high school I barely talk to anyone because i’m so insecure, but I just feel like no one would even notice me if i went missing at all. back at my old school people knew about me but like they only thought I was that quiet kid and I was even called a school shooter by some people. I just don’t understand why I can’t talk to people i’m not great at anything, the only thing I do is play video games and thats where i get to be free and talk to people but always in the end im alone with no one to talk to. I really don’t enjoy doing anything video games are starting to get boring to me I just want something to do in my life and not be a shut in for most of it."

depression,Trouble sleeping,"For the past couple months, ive been waking up in the middle of the night, more than once sometimes and have trouble going back to sleep. Its been a while where I just had a straight 7 hours a sleep. I just get too stressed and anxious about where I am in life and how much of a loser I am. I think too much about the things I desperately want but dont have, and grow jelous of people which also doesnt help getting back to sleep faster. I try to compensate this by taking naps in the afternoon but I just feel awful after waking up from a nap but oh well."
depression,"I don’t post much, but I’m not sure what else to do.","So I want to start off by saying that I’m not diagnosed however I did talk to my doctor about the way I’ve been feeling not too long ago (about a month and a half ago) and he gave me some meds.


I’m posting here in seek of people who may be able to help me get a little bit of insight on how to get out of this rut I’m in. I’m a 25 year old man, who still lives with his parents and hasn’t had a relationship since 2014. I can’t seem to hold down a job and I left my last one because my mental health hit an all time low. The biggest part is, when I think about getting a nine to five, I just shut down and start to think “why do I want to work and then just die, might as well just go now, life isn’t worth it if all I’m ever going to do is chase money” and things of that sort. It’s not a good spot to be in cause I actually do have a few responsibilities I need taken care of. I don’t want to work a job that I don’t LOVE because then I won’t be happy, but all of these boring jobs, I know I won’t be super interested in and honestly the thought of working something that I don’t look forward to doing every single day fills me with apathy and lethargy and just downright sadness. Any input is welcome. Sorry if this isn’t the place for the post, but I don’t know where else to go. Thanks in advance."

depression,Its almost like im paying the price for being depressed,"I sleep all day because i want to sleep away the depression. I go to bed at 4am and wake up at 6pm. The whole day is gone. Whatever. But what really makes me hate this depression is the concept of not being able to live properly due to a massive chain reaction. Heres that

I dont have a job and have been rejected by every company, this then leads to no income. My only income is government support getting only $400 a month. 

I am living on the edge everyday, cant go out and its on a constant groundhog day loop of being in between 50-70$ saved after rent etc. then random things come up like bills etc. What does this then lead to? No good food to buy. I resort to then getting takeaway, this leads to weight gain, this leads to me become an ugly version of myself, which then leads to not being wanted by anyone, rejected by dating sites etc. it is fucking endless. Whats the root? Money.
Then things like doing chores etc all because i want to sleep away the depression. Im scared to move because if i do i feel like i might die. It all mounds up over time which then leads to stress. Im contemplated suicide multiple times but pull it off as a joke when my friend ask if im ok. I feel like most people have their shit together at 25. Im just beginning this hell hole."
depression,Spiraling,"This past year I have become a version of myself that I didn’t even think was possible. I’ve become everything I hate. I was so bored stuck at home that I began drinking to pass the time. My drinking became excessive and absolutely destroyed my mental health while severely damaging my relationship. After spending some time in the mental hospital, I was finally put on meds (Zoloft, Wellbutrin, buspirone). I no longer have negative thoughts, unnecessary guilt, or self hatred. But I also do not have any motivation to do anything. All I want to do is sleep. I’m going completely broke from missing so many shifts at work. Ive ruined my boyfriends trust by lying about multiple stupid things. I can’t do a single productive thing or even have a creative thought unless I abuse some kind of stimulant. I have no idea what I’m doing, where I’m going, and I just don’t care. Why is it so hard to want to live life? I have no desire to do anything at all. Waking up is absolutely dreadful because the thought of having a busy day cripples me. I feel like I’m just rambling making no sense. Can anyone else relate?"
depression,My life is worthless,I don’t think my partner will ever propose and it’s been so long that I genuinely don’t see any meaning in life anymore. I want to kill myself. If he doesn’t want a future with me then what’s the point? I feel like I’m spiralling out of control.
depression,Scar fix,"If anyone has self harm scars that are bad, I recommend using cocoa butter vaseline and rub it in with a lot of force and massage it in for like at least 15 minutes. And massage it in each direction and circles. I had to do it a lot to get my scar down but I got my scar down tremendously, it was a big puffed up one. I’ve had to do it multiple days , many, maybe like a couple weeks worth of days and a lot of doing it but getting my scar to look better and go away is making me more confident and just enough happier for it to be worth it. just my advice, I hope i can help at least one person&lt;3"
depression,Please someone help me,"So, this is random, but I just wanted to say being alone is terrible. These past few months, in fact the whole past year has really been a garage fire. I've lost almost everyone. And, basically everything. I struggle to live, minute by minute. Knowing that when I go home, at the end of the day, there's just a blank wall staring back at me. And I have no one to blame but myself. I try to fight it, I say that I found something new to bring me meaning or joy; but it's all fleeting. So I can't help but sit there and ache. Everything hurts, everything is worse, and I have no one to tell about it. I make desperate pleas and cries for help and attention, but the theater is empty. I always said, the shit show must go on. But, what about when everyone is tired and wants to go home? Are you simply to keep them there, cause you don't have a home. Who are you to put a show on for, if no one is ever gonna bother.. it's terrifying. I'm scared, and I know I'm not, truly alone. But this sure does feel like it. And everyday when I go to work and a coworker or a customer asks me how I'm doing, I just wanna break down and tell him how it's all so terrible and beg them to tell me how do they manage? How do they keep going every day? How? Cause I don't know what, or who I even am anymore."
depression,I’m tired of going nowhere,"I feel so shitty. People are so ugly and mean to each other it sucks. I missed a dose of my antidepressants because I’ve been giving it my all at work. People put me down because I make mistakes. I’m trying to learn. 

I think I’m getting close to the end of my life. I’ve been having nightmares and thoughts of just being done with it. I don’t know what to do. Everything I do, doesn’t matter. I just want to get passed all this.


I hope I make it. But I’m starting to doubt I will. Anyway, thanks for listening."
depression,Life is being a disappointment,"- Home all day because of lockdown

- Lost touch with friends, never got contacted back when i stopped

- Barber messed up my haircut

- Feeling of being avoided or ignored whenever I try to make online friends

- Keep seeing couples having fun or just hanging out whenever I try to take a walk by myself to clear my mind

- Fighting with inferiority complex, self esteem issues, loneliness everyday

- Feeling pressured and stressed about my future

This either sounds like a comedy movie or just a sad hopeless movie. These things may sound small or not too much compared to what people go through. But feeling all of them all together, every single day, is really. exhausting for me. Hope life gets on a steady wheel soon. I try, but sometimes I feel its also based on my luck… which you can assume how good it is. Thanks for reading."
depression,I (M17) hate my life.,"First of all I just want to say that I am blessed with my life situation. My parents are well off, and I have a roof and food on the table. My situation is way better than most, but yet I still don't feel complete. 

I simply would like advice for what you would do in my situation, I know there's a lot you guys out there some wisdom to drop. 

I live in the Philippines, and we are still in lockdown. I'm American Indian, and a majority of the foreigners in the country have left due to covid, and even though I lived here my whole life, it just doesn't feel like home. I don't speak the language in this country, and I feel so out of place. I have many acquaintances, but only 2 real friends (4 of my real friends moved away). I miss having a deep connection with a woman, but due to covid, I can't go out and meet many people like I used to, and I have to settle for the girls in my grade, who I don't connect with. I go to school online, and spend majority of my week on zoom, and I spend hours after school studying. I just feel like I'm losing options. I do still have some people that I get to see, but I still feel so lonely.

I've been training really hard in the gym and for Muay Thai, while doing things to try and keep my mind right. That's been keeping me somewhat composed. Yet, I just feel like it's not enough. 

In 10 months I can leave this country, and go to Uni in the US, but that just feels like years away. Everyday I feel like I'm going deeper and deeper into a hole. I don't want to be in this bullshit cycle anymore. 

I know that life isn't all fun and games, and I can't control everything, but I just feel like I should be doing something more."

depression,It's a wonder to myself too.,"It's a mystery and a frightening one as to how casually I think of suicide in my daily life. I would be sitting before my laptop during class and thinking out the scenarios where I would be dying. A painless and beautiful death. It's as if I am already dead and have accepted it too. 

Does anyone else feel like that?"
depression,every day is the same,"the days blend together, i don’t keep track of what day it is anymore. my parents even worry about that, they ask me what day it is and almost everytime i say “i don’t know”. it’s like the same day replays over and over, i wake up, eat, sleep again, play games, sleep. nothing exciting ever happens and i only have myself to blame. i enjoy being alone and isolating myself, yet i complain about being alone and feeling lonely. it’s my fault but i can’t help it. i don’t even know what i feel anymore? these antidepressants are doing exactly what i worried about, theyre making me numb. i cant cry anymore, i feel no emotion."
depression,mini venting,"i think i put myself where im at today because of the regrettable things i did growing up. it’s affected so many aspects of my life.. i completely ruined my reputation and because of it i’ve been so alone for a long time. i’m so tired of crying my self to sleep, i’m so tired of feeling like there’s no way out of this. i feel so judged by the people who know me irl . i just want a friend, but in reality i believe this is all my karma, and i deserve all of this."

depression,Looks like love isn't for me,"I've never fell in love with anyone and I'm gonna be 18 soon.

I've had crushes, but I've never had a gf or anything. All of my friend are/have been in relationships, and I'm just so lonely. I always say its fine and it will come when the time is right, but I've been waiting for so long it feels like it will never happen."
depression,Once Again,"I hate myself so much to the point that any positivity that might come my way feels empty because I know happiness doesn’t last. Anytime I think life can go good for me, something has to knock me down. I feel so empty and void of love. I am 22 and I have no one by my side. I feel so worthless. Therapy isn’t working and life is looking more useless to endure. I hate having to suffer with these thoughts but suicide crossed my mind often. I just want to escape to place where I am loved and acknowledged. I feel so isolated and insignificant. I just want to go away from this world. I have little feeling and motivation left to keep me here."

depression,Getting depressed after playing a certain game,"Hi everyone, basically, right now. Im in a sgitty mental state. I have literally no reason for it as far as i can see. I have a decent life, amazing friends, a beautiful, wonderful and loving girlfriend. I... parents are just eh, but no arguments have happendd in last few days. Anyway, whenever i play guitar hero, i always find myself ending up getting depressed a few days later. Its dont get annoyed at the game or anything or annoyed at my skill bcc im pretty good at the game, it just some reason causes me to not feel myself after some days, i think it might b bcc i used the game to help me through my biggest bit of depression and now i just automatically link it to depression therefore, making me feel this way, i just want to know if this is a posibility that bcc i used to to help depression that the link to it might cause it"

depression,getting drunk isn't even helping me sleep.,this is actually getting real bad. i really have no idea what to do.
depression,I think this is just it,"I don't think things will ever get better. I have been struggling for years an I know I'm the problem. Therapy isn't helping idk what I'm supposed to gain from just sitting there rehashing the news or what my kid did. 

She asks what I want to work on an im like... if I knew how to fix me I wouldn't be here wasting everyone's time... I don't feel better an I don't feel like I'm gaining any skills from this but I haven't with any therapist previously either. This leads me to the conclusion it is me doing therapy wrong. I am once again the problem. I know people will say to find a new therapist but this feels like a cycle all my therapist fall in, if I'm just a bad patient beyond being helped what's the point? 

I wish I was brave. I wish I could just end it all I'm a useless coward who is just a perpetual burden on the world around me. 

I'm so tired of living like this... I'm so tired of me being the problem."
depression,Don't kniw if I'm depressed or just a lazy person ://,[removed]
depression,It never even began for me,"I have extreme social anxiety. It pisses me the fuck off when people say just talk to more people. uhmmmmm.... literally everytime I talk to people i fuck it up by being so socially awkward. so no, that will make me feel worse and i've already talked to countless people in my life. I have a bland personality due to depression. Im not even great looking. Im a virgin at 22, its obvious im never gonna get laid and it hurts alot. I feel pathetic like a little bitch sometimes. cant even talk to people when everyone around me gets laid and is desired like nothing. Its hard to not take my own life honestly. Last night was trying to sleep and just kept having images of suicide going over in my head and felt at peace. I fucking hate this existence. Im treated like a lab rat, therapy is too pricey and only helps at best 10%. I just got back from the gym, why am i not happy, why am i not normal? Don't tell me there is no normal F off, there is."
depression,Not sure how to feel about my first (and probably last) call to the suicide hotline,"I've never reached out to anyone before but I finally called the suicide hotline after the past couple weeks of suicidal ideation. It went horribly and makes me regret trying in the first place.

At first I called and then I hung up before the automated message ended because I was nervous. I then called again and waited on hold for a few minutes before getting into contact with someone.

The woman on the other side spoke in a very robotic tone. She asked me if I was actively suicidal, I said no but life has felt like too much recently and I was almost considering it the day before.

She asks why I currently feel this way and I tell her that there wasn't a specific reason I've just been depressed for years and I'm hitting a breaking point.

She then responds with ""this is a suicide hotline are you suicidal or do you just want to talk?"" Her tone wasn't rude but it felt like she was implying that I was using the number for the wrong reason because I wasn't actively suicidal at that second.

I don't remember how I responded but she returned asking if I wanted help for the problem and I knew she was going to refer me to a therapist so I hung up. I'm already waiting for a doctor's appointment that will get me a referral to a therapist covered by my insurance, so staying on the line was pointless.

I don't know how to feel about this. I feel like I was basically told ""you're not suicidal enough for this to be our concern"". I just wanted someone to talk to about the thoughts.  I don't know where I was supposed to go in the middle of the night with those feelings. I know it's supposed to be a crisis hotline that talks people off the edge so I probably shouldn't be surprised, but I feel like I was punished for going somewhere for help. I don't want to blame the person on the other side because it may just be how she's trained and I maybe shouldn't have called the number, but I felt entirely dismissed in my issue and left feeling like I was wrong for even trying.

Needless to say I probably won't be calling again. I felt hurt and unjustified in reaching out and given her robotic tone I don't even know if the people on the other end would be any help if I was actively suicidal."
depression,Someday it is just sad,"Nothing special, just feel sad over works and disappointed in people and society. I am out of suicidal zone for a long time, just feel sad for a day.

I don't need advice, comfort or anything, tomorrow I will probably be better. Just want to share to a place that I know people can relate.

Keep fighting while you can."
depression,I'm depressed,"I feel alone right now. I feel like I want to cry. I have a history of depression. I stopped taking my antidepressant I think it was earlier this year. I felt numb and I didn't want to take something every day. Because at some point I have to deal with life and my emotions. The antidepressants are a bandaid for the problems I had and have. But right now I'm depressed. I don't know why but I need to address my emotions and issues. I typically eat to fill up time and distract myself. Now I don't do that. 
What do y'all do to help yourself? How do you deal with the issues you don't want to bring out?"
depression,I need someone to talk to or give me advice please,"I am a 22 year old father of 2 school age children and I am stuck.

I can barley pay rent I live off of the food I get for free from work my short shifts due to no being able to afford child care while my children are not in school. I don't know how much longer I can live my life like this. All of my money goes to bill and making sure my kids get fed. I am not asking for donations just letting stuff off my chest to at least 1 person who hopefully reads. I never wanted kids and I know it's my fault I had sex without protection and I hate my life. I wish I could go back and change everything, I wish I never meet their mother, I wish I would have never even seen her she has ruined my life I can keep a relationship because of her I can't live my life in peice and everyday I think about ending it. I love my kids I do, but I hate them at the same time they are why I get up everyday but idk how much longer I can do it I want to end it. But I feel guilty for feeling this way for everyone in my life. I didn't get to go to college, I barley graduated high-school, I can't get a full time job because childcare is ridiculously expensive. I don't want to let them live with their mother due to her being abusive and neglecting the kids so the only time I can work longer than a 5.5 hour day is ever lying other weekend when they are with her. I want to die. I don't see a future for myself, I don't think I can make it another 2 years. I want to die. End everything. No more worries. I want to be dead."

I was sexually used by my ex best friend when I was eleven and I just have a lot of childhood trauma and trauma that’s forming now. It hurts and I don't know what to do. I have lightly tied things around my neck instead of actually trying and I’ve also started self harming and rarely eating..

Can someone recommend me movies/series that will make me cry or at least depressing movies. Here’s some list of movies that usually i watch when feel like shit and need to cry:
- the virgin suicides
- suicide room (but honestly the last time i watch this movie is when i’m still a teenager, the overdose scene in the end really gets me)
- a walk to remember
- miracle in cell no.7
- if i stay

That’s all i can think of right now. Thanks in advance for any recommendations."

A lot of shit has been failing recently and it feels like life is kicking me in the ass even though it’s been doing that for awhile now. It’s just so sad. Recently it’s been feeling like everything isn’t just worth it anymore. School, YouTube, App Design, nothing at all. Any thoughts on how to get back in it?

depression,New form of self harm?,"Lately I have been stealing things from people in my life and just,,, not returning them. I don't want to do this. It makes me feel guilty and disgusting. But I can't stop! And the things I'm stealing aren't even things I want? It'll be a couple dollars, a random charm, a food item, a shirt.

Why do I have to mope around every day bringing everyone else around me down too, like I'm the anchor on a ship and they are the chain. Dragging them down to the depths I am in, I can't deal with this world any more. Just someone or something please remove me from this hell hole. I can't bring myself to do it as I fear my parents finding my body, and my girlfriend having to mourn the loss of her boyfriend. So I just suffer to keep other people happy, if anything it just feels worse and worse each day. For the past 7 weeks everyday without fail, I wake up and dread the day ahead, suicidal thoughts rush through my head like a raging river. Then I sigh, get out of bed somehow with all the energy I can muster, my eyes feel heavy throughout the day. I can't keep going on like this, if this is what life is going to  be like for the rest of my life. I'd rather be dead. I want to cry so badly but I can't get the tears to fall from the ducts, they just pool up and blur my sight. This ""depression"" as people call it WILL BE the death of me, I am not going to die from natural causes but from my own mental hellscape."
depression,Feels so pointless,"I have no motivation to find another job. The sensational news headlines and social media posts bombard me every day and drive me deeper into a hole. I feel like I’ve lost myself. I used to have a dog and a house and friends and I’ve lost all of that. I feel so isolated and the things that used to be a routine part of my day (cooking, cleaning, yoga) feel like mountainous tasks.

My diet is just terrible. I've had issues with a restricted diet for years, i have enormous anxiety around eating new foods, and its almost impossible to imagine ever having a diet that would be called healthy by anyone.
Atleast i dont drink i guess."
depression,Am I depressed/suicidal?,"Trigger w: suicidal thoughts

Hi everyone, I am not very comfortable discussing this with people close to me, so I wanted to ask here. Am I suicidal if I see suicide as a comfort thought? In the sense that if things become very tough or I fail in areas in my life, I can always just stop existing?"
depression,I feel so lost and hopeless,"I just feel like I need to share my pain with someone, and no one in real life understands. I'm glad to find this community exists. (I'm sorry this is going to be really long) 

Okay soo... The last two years of my life have been tough (and probably for most of us) Just over two years ago, I graduated from university and got married soon after. Sounds like happy occasions so far right? Well not exactly. Basically right after I graduated, Covid hit. Despite applying to literally hundreds of jobs, I struggled to even get a few interviews. After finally finding a job, I was made redundant a few months later (again covid related). Everyone I know keeps on asking me about what I'm doing and to make things worse, my family like to remind me every how I'm doing nothing all day and wasting my life 😓 This has made me feel so useless and depressed.

Problem no. 2: Due to a combination of Covid travel restrictions and visa challenges, my husband and I haven't seen each other in a year and a half. I feel like my life has just been on hold for these last 2 years, and I'll never get this time back. 

I know I am lucky in many ways and I know there are others in much much worse situations than me, but it's hard to see through it 😓

Any emotional support would be highly appreciated. Thank you so much❤️❤️"
depression,Doctor with depression,"I am a Muslim woman who married a 35-year-old man when I was 18 years old, I am now 34. I have four children and as per the religious principles and I do not frequently leave the house, at the beginning of the marriage I wore a face veil, and spent nearly all my time inside my house and was not allowed to leave the house, not even for medical reasons at times due to my husband constantly accusing me of sleeping with, desiring or being at risk or sleeping with any male person who I would potentially interact with and his speech and attitude was very harsh and unkind. This was between 2005-2012 in which I never desired another male or female person. During this time I became isolated from my family and in return, my husband continued to do this to me until I cheated on him...twice and engaged in other somewhat hedonistic behaviors (engaging in sexual acts with women with which I do not normally desire or find myself attracted to and placing myself in situations where men would be able to hurt or force themselves on me) which were directly related to me needing transportation to and from work, where I would flirt with a man to entice him to give me a ride. He found out and claimed to forgive me, but his accusations got worse, and then he completely stopped expressing any form of love and affection for me. 

Recently, he admitted to me that he is physically attracted to a girl who is 10 years younger than me, so much so that he hired her to work with him and he communicated with her kindly and showed his concern, arranging pick up and drop-offs to and from her new job. I trust that he is not cheating, he is being open and honest with me but he constantly tells me he likes to see her face, in a bold, harsh and hurtful manner, something he never tells me, so much so that, he only complements me on my coloured contacts calling me a Kashmiri girl. He does not even call me by my first name or a nickname, he is only now starting to call my name. 

He finally, after fighting, admitted and apologised for his past unkindness to me, but I now feel like my only purpose on this earth was to have children and lose my beauty only to be discarded. I am afraid to give him another chance but I know the children would be better off with their father present as he is a good father. I feel hopeless, I feel ugly and I feel useless. Also, after the devastating hurricane maria, he gave me little emotional support when I was experiencing flashbacks and nightmares which carry on until today. Instead, he accused me of wanting to sleep with my cousin's husband because I and my family were all sitting together and laughing and I laughed at one of his jokes. I understand that now we are going to try to move on since he did apologize, but since I am the one who takes care of the emotional part of the relationship, I believe I need to work on myself in order to appreciate his effort. We are both doctors, he is in the spotlight, the country is small, I do not feel comfortable seeing a local psychologist or psychiatrist.

Both growing up as an only child, we eventually considered ourselves as brothers, given how much we’d see each other. This past summer I had come back from my final year in college to see him and about three weeks in, he took his own life. Of course at first it was VERY difficult; simply an assortment of emotions that is impossible to describe over text. I thought I had started to feel better about a month after… probably from all the drinking, but now everything is just going to shit. All I can feel now is hatred and sadness. The only times I can remotely feel happiness are for mundane, stupid things such as making a cool play in a video game in which the artificial happiness only lasts for a short time. I mentioned my experience with mental illness before, because I have dealt with all of this and felt as though I almost conquered it with no medication, but what I’ve been feeling recently is something much more intense and dark. Honestly never felt this lost in my life and I need help."
depression,"Countless places to see, billions of people to meet and yet I'm trapped","Funny how there's literally countless things you could do and wondrous places to see around the globe and yet not only are you restricted by physical means and personal limits but also the inescapable prison that is your own mind.

So many goddamn things you need to have and need to be just so that you could experience a fraction of what you think will make you happy. Its just exhausting to think about."
depression,Please help,"Hi I just accidentally took 10,000mg of ibruprofen. Didn’t realize the dosage was so high on the bottle. Am sad but don’t want to end up in the hospital or sick. I am 138 lbs and female. do you think it will be okay or should I seek help? idk where to post this"
depression,Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?,"For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first.

My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past.

My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippledn nor do I have friends to help me.

I’ve managed to land a doctor’s visit under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral.

I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time while using all personal my part-time money to pay for any separate medication. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked by my parents.

I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?

Also how do these things go?? Growing up in a homeopathic environment has left me clueless."

depression,Dumb and confused,"Sometimes I get really dumb, and it bothers me. I’ll have jumbled thoughts, ideas don’t move continuously. I have ADHD, but this feels different. My normal struggles with focus leave me intelligent; I basically lose the ability to do anything that requires thought, even if it’s something I’ve done many times before, during the “dumb periods.” Does this make any sense? I don’t think this has always happened to me, so I’m curious about other peoples’ experiences.

depression,What's the Point?: A Cureless Existence.,"Clinical depression is an imbalance of chemicals in your brain that causes depression.
We have way to measure the levels of these chemicals.
We don't know what the ""good level"" is (supposedly its different for everyone?)
We have no idea how much a given dosage of a given drug is going to affects the levels in someone's brain.
And even if you're lucky enough to get on a drug dose that works...there's a high chance you'll have to stay on it forever and even a chance that it will become ineffective and you will have to be put something else.
Honestly, I am just tired of it...I don't want to deal with it anymore because it is exhausting.
And being told that you will mostly likely be dealing with something you have no control over for the rest if your life makes me wonder: is it even worth it?"

I feel like I’m faking it bc even tho I still feel horrible when I’m around people I’m not crying and I’m actually trying to engage with them. I hate myself so much I wish I could just tell someone how much I’m hurting. I want to feel loved so badly, I want to feel better so fucking much. I have literally no idea how to tell my friends how much I really really really want to die and how much it affects me. I don’t want to seem like an asshole when I don’t respond bc I’m having a panic attack but I don’t want to tell them it was a panic attack bc I feel like they’ll hate me and think I’m sneaking attention. I wish they would just tell me they hate me that would make things easier. I wish they all abandoned me so I didn’t bother them and I could finally Fucking kill myself"

depression,"I know someone ain't gonna read this, but anyways. Here's some nonsense wrote by a 19 years old child.","I don't want to think about my future. It's dark. Why ?

Sometimes foreign customers come to the grocery store that I work. They've surprised to hear an average cashier talking in English, sometimes I make small conversations with foreigners. Some local customers even congratulate me because of my English speaking capability. I want to use this talent at a job. Translator would be a good option. But can I do it ? I don't know. What if I fail ? If I can't be a translator what can I do ? Being in tech industry. For example ; a game designer, software engineer, programmer, information technology, web designer etc... Perhaps I've got a talent for designing a web site. I graduated from web design division of my high school. Maybe I can make an income from this. Who knows ? What happens if this doesn't work ? I've got one more option. Being a photographer or a cameraman. I've had an enthusiasm about photography a year ago. This wouldn't be a bad idea. Being a photographer or a cameraman. What if this doesn't work ? Well, I'm out of options. The only way to get out is death. I'll commit suicide if I don't have a job and career in the future. Let's imagine for a minute. Me, a 30 years old grown ass man, unemployed, his mom and dad were died, his brother and sister left him alone. He's about to go insane. His past haunted him, with failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, bad decisions. He cry every time. He wanna go back to his childhood but he can't. He can't sleep, he can't eat, he just want to be dead. He picks up a gun. Shove it to his mouth, pulled the trigger, and bang ! He's gone. Will he rest in peace ? I don't think so. Because nobody knew about him. As if he wasn't lived. He's just an another fuel for the soil. He'll be vanished. 

I don't want to be like that. What the fuck I will do ? I DONT FUCKING KNOW !!! 

I gotta make a roadmap. But I can't. I FUCKING CAN'T. Because some cunt will be a manager or boss in a goddamn job with his father's help. In spite I worked like a slave. Road has some traps that I can't dismiss. May god help me and others. I lost my hope. There's no hope."

depression,Such a waste,"I wish that I could feel better. I probably should get back to using anti-depressants, but I am afraid of side effects. 

I am not sure that I can do much to make things better for myself. It's not so much that I was dealt some bad cards - most people get that -, it's also my character and extremely low self-esteem.

Some years ago I did make an effort, and for a while I managed a few things - nothing great, but something. Mostly succeeded in securing some income, although barely enough to be able to sustain myself. During those years, I did come across a few women and went on dates, but ultimately I never felt secure enough to go beyond that, and they picked it up and gave up on me.

I also was in therapy, though mostly prior to all that - and for a full decade, with two psychiatrists. Maybe the first one just didn't suit me at all, and I wasted 8 years there. The second one was better suited to me, but then money problems forced me to stop going.

It's just all a very sad story. I do know from experience that your mood can change drastically, even with almost everything else staying the same. But many days I can't even bear to look myself at the mirror.

I had deep depression since I was in highschool, but I am now approaching middle age, and I don't like at all how I find myself at times concluding my loop of depressive thoughts with the idea that - if it comes to that - I could just kill myself, so for the time being I could hang on for a while longer to see if things improve.

Anyway, this is my post. I don't think it can help anyone. Rather sounds bleak, even by my standards :) I guess I will just take the anti-depressants again, and try to continue."
depression,"my boyfriend is severely depressed, and sent me the following texts.","please tell me, what should i do? it breaks my heart to see him like this. (he talks about our relationship and his life situation in general. 
pd: he recently started going to therapy)

The texts:

“There are acts that can be very valuable but to no avail. I have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse. We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd. It would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else.”

“It is simply useless already, it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever. There’s no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.”

“I consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.”

“Everything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.”

“In December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.”

It is very heartbreaking to see him like this. He has said these things to me many times, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way, but it is still hard. He always ends up coming back to me, and I want to be supportive of him and do whatever I have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me. 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible, but he keeps pushing me away. what should I really do?"

i am stuck in a really stressful situation and i have no way of coping with it. i have tried crying it out but i don't feel sad enough anymore. the only emotions that i've been able to experience recently are anxiety and anger. 

so much has happened in the past two years that i could literally witness a murder and i dont think it would have an effect on me. everything seems to be losing its meaning to me, even things that would've deeply upset me in the past, or the things that i used to really enjoy and appreciate.

It's not that I don't technically have anybody to talk to, but I'm tired of being a burden to my friends. When I think back about how I used to be, and who I am now, I feel like I'm drowning. I'm taking a degree that I never wanted to do, but I don't have any other alternatives. Everybody is leaving. I'm young, but I feel like my life is already at its end. All that I want is to close my eyes and never wake up again. I've thought about committing suicide several times.

depression,advice on depression,"I think I've been struggling with depression for the last couple of years. I've wanted to kill myself but honestly, just have never been able to work up the courage to do it. I want to be able to talk to my family about this, but we don't talk about mental health or anything even remotely similar. At a certain point, I kind of gave up on talking to them and just decided I was going to deal with it until I graduated college and could afford to send myself to therapy. However, I kind of realized that the chances I was going to make it until then aren't great, so I would probably need to do something before. That being the case, I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice on how to talk to my family and how to ask for their support?"
depression,Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me.,I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep. I cry when I wake. I crave death. There are so many methods. It all causes pain. But I can't feel them. I can't process emotions. What is pain? Sounds like something I know. I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.
depression,Back in the fog again,"Didn't think I'd be back here again as I thought things in my life were suddenly looking up. I'm currently a semi-professional athlete who's looking to make it full-time. Its been my dream for a very long time and to people on the outside it looking that way. 

However due to injury plus the pandemic I've effectively missed two years of playing. I'm 26(M) and I feel like I've put in a lot of time and effort for very little return. It makes me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time focussing on this one thing and seriously brings me down. 

Coupled with that I've been battling serious anxiety issues since I was in primary school, I worry loads about the future and struggle to think far ahead. I've pursued sports relentlessly as it was the only thing that gave me pure joy and what I thought I was good at. Also making it would provide significant financial reward. 

Seeing friends on social media excel in their respective careers and enjoy life has made me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time and adds to my depression. It also Makes me feel as though I'm not as worth much to people because I'm not doing big thing so I'm not good enough to be around them and more importantly I'm not worth much to myself. 

Since I was young I've never really had people think I could amount to much (aside from my mum) of whom I extremely want to make proud. But overall it has hugely imlacted my mental health to points where I doubt myself and end up asking myself if I've even learnt anything during my time of living. 

I also feel as though since we're now slowly coming out of the pandemic, life as gotten better for most (which is good) but somehow worse for me which may be naive to think but it appears to be that way. To the point whereby I struggle to have simple conversations with people, I don't find things as funny anymore and my attention to detail on things has gone out the window . 

I even feel when writing this message I'm not articulating myself the best as my brain is in a fog at the moment. Doing things such as getting out of bed is becoming an issue but I  feel bad each time if I'm wasting time. I'm struggling to make sense with reality and it's becoming very overwhelming. I don't have money to see a therapist as I quit my job in Sales due to the stress it was bringing and the way it was affecting my performance in sport. 

Overall I've some how wound up in another depressive episode and it seems to be the worst. I thought I was mentally becoming more resilient after okay for a good amount of time but I just  feel lost and confused and it's all happening at a time when things should be going well. 

For people who have experience dealing with this or can relate to this situation in any type of way, what did you do to cope with it and change your lives for the better and permanent."
depression,I missed out on dating in my 20s now.. I am an incel..,"first my teens, and now my 20s, and Im somehow supposed to be content with that and accept it. of course Im pissed off and why wouldnt I be? I missed out on things literally 99% of Earth has done. now I get the pleasure of dating between 3 options, single mothers, girls with triple digit body counts, and obese landwhales. 

my youth is gone, my looks while were already terrible will only get worse, my metabolism and health will only get worse from here on out.. 

of course no one will understand my pain because Im just an incel afterall right. people who have never been lonely sure do seem to have a lot of experience for it dont they? yeah right.. people cant understand how hard it is and how much it tears apart your mental wellbeing completely being alone, like actually alone, not living with your mother alone, like isolated in an apt alone for years, humans are social creatures by nature, our mental state cant cope being lonely for that long. 

if you want proof of that just look at how many normal people cracked just from being in quarantine for a month back in March... now try years because that's my life 

this is kind of a vent but also im suicidal so i doubt ill make it another year. watch my face will end up on another with all the other lonely men who ended  up on [facesofsuicide.com](https://facesofsuicide.com)

depression,I feel like I'm suffocating,"I don't know if it's relevant for this post, I'm a 27-year-old woman. My ex of (almost) seven years, broke up with me 5 months ago. We weren't happy, and I think that my diagnosis (Personality disorder(s) with comorbid depression and other stuff), helped him with that decision.   
Because of that, I had to move back to my parents, I can't afford to live alone because my therapy consumes a good chunk of my salary.   
I feel like I'm suffocating like I have this pressure on my chest and throat. It's hard to breathe. I'm constantly on the verge of crying, not because I miss my ex, but because I have this feeling, or rather I'm sure that my life is and is going to be miserable. I see no future and hope for myself.   
I have enough of my life, this neverending vicious cycle, the same routine everyday.  
I wake up, get dressed, go for a walk with my dog, work, go for a walk, exercise, walk the dog.  
Everyday is the same. I eat the same food, wear the same clothes, nothing changes. Or rather I don't change, but everything around me is constantly changing, and I am stuck, slowly suffocating, barely being able to pull my shit together.  
I'm in this place right now, that I would give anything to be able to feel anything, I want to get drunk, high, just to feel something different. I want to meet new people, have affairs, travel, disappear.   
But I can't... I'm stuck in the ivory tower, my prison, my room.   
I try to get out more, be more sociable, but every time I match with someone on a dating app I begin to feel so heartbroken (?) like I know that nothing will ever come out of this because I'm too scared to get out of my room and go on a date. I fear, that they will not like me, find me attractive enough. That's why I stick to texting and ghosting people when they ask me out. I know it's horrible. But I can't help it. I'm a failure, yet I'm so frightened to be perceived as one. And I know that I'm quite good-looking, in good shape, and I can be fun to be around. But lately, I feel like a potato sack, unattractive, with nothing to offer.  
I feel like I'm going to end up all alone, resenting everyone, because they have something, that I won't ever get - happiness and peace of mind.

but i know i won't. i've felt like this before. but i never have the willpower to actually cut myself off from them. i have nothing else in my life and i feel addicted to checking my messages etc so i try to leave but then just come back after a few hours. i'm absolutely pathetic. more reason why i should cut myself off from them. i feel really worthless and stupid and i feel like they secretly can't stand me. i can't stand myself either.

To make things worse, they’re still friendly with that relative and just pretend like nothing happened. I don’t understand them at all. I’m still in college and very much dependant on them, so I can’t move out or anything. Should I just ignore what happened like it wasn’t a big deal? It took a lot of courage for me to open up to them and they just brushed it off like it was nothing."

depression,Feeling really useless,"I've always been a lurker or casual commenter here, so here's my first post.

This lockdown has really exacerbated my depression. (tho the culprit really is just being in a human society lol) I feel isolated and alone. I've opened up to a few people but I always end up sounding like a broken record and people say the same shallow things to console me. So I just stopped talking to the people around me about feeling depressed.

My depression has led me to quitting my job; trust me, I wasn't far from getting let go. So I quit before it got real bad. I worked in a creative industry and the burnout feels permanent. And I struggle to make money. Freelance pays so little, and I'm living off my life savings, which is not much. Plus my art isn't even doing well. My works are ignored, or even if I get a commission or freelance project, I get paid less than minimum wage. I've learnt to say no and I do negotiate my rates but the desperation has caused me to just do what I can to stay afloat. I'm almost 30, so being a crybaby about it just paints myself as immature to those around me. Never gonna be able to afford a house, car, kids. I don't have the capacity to handle most jobs. But I did try my best before this.

Most days I have sleep and tears for dinner. I always forget to shower and brush my teeth. My partner is stuck overseas indefinitely, so I've lost my strongest support system. The pain and loss I feel on a daily basis is unbearable.

Some days I wish I had the guts to just end my life, but instead I just wallow in my own sadness and filth. I don't even know what would make me happy, or at least dull the pain a little. Maybe some company and a bit of help here and there would make it a bit better, but I know I'd still feel dead inside. And therapy? I can't afford it. Plus I know how therapists console people. I'm sure some of you relate to that thing you do where you have a rebuttal for every advice given... I've been the therapist friend, only just speaking from experience.  


There's no point to this post, just letting it out of my chest."

YOU AREN’T THE ONE WITH DEPRESSION. YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT ITS LIKE TO LIVE WITH THAT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. DEPRESSION. IS. NOT. JUST. FEELING. SAD. YOU CANNOT JUST GET OVER IT.

I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help? Thank you."
depression,I am just a huge disappointment,Hello. Just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me. I woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing I do every morning and when I walked out I overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me. Obviously this hurt and usually I don't cry much but this morning I cried like a bitch. Hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts. Ugh. He says that he loves me but sometimes I don't know how true that is. I just wish that I didn't exist. I've been depressed for years and nothing has changed. I have lost nearly all my friends because I'm a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness. I'm starting college soon and my parents don't have any faith in me and honestly I don't have any faith in myself. I could barely pass high school because I have 0 motivation. How in the world would I be able to pass through college. I don't know how much longer I can take this shit... I've seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem. Like really??? She was completely useless and I haven't seen one since. I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and I have everything I could want. A gaming PC. A high end smartphone. A puppy. And life still is just as mundane as usual. The only thing I have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night. Fuck. I'm starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary. I don't really know why I'm making this post I just wanted to get it all out I guess. I'm just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills I guess.
depression,Whining about my past and current state,"I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here)

Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it 🙃 However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight? Well you'll hate yourself either way, don't you? Gyms are open again? Well, fucking fall while biking, hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you can't even bike anymore, because you've got no money to repair it! And let's face it... You need money for a new PC first, because yours is broken and you need one for university, you need new clothes, at least a jacket for when it gets colder!"". I really can't do this anymore. Maybe I'm just whiny... I don't know. But in the end that's just a small insight into my life. I'm 22 now and I'm at that point again I wonder if it even makes sense anymore. Especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either. And the worst thing is... Compared to others, looking at what I've reached yet (at least looking at my apartment). I feel horrible, because I should probably feel good about myself, because I've got it better. I've invested a lot of money into it and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Others would dream of that at that age... Maybe I just can't get enough? I really don't know...

Thanks for reading tho. Don't know if anyone got some advice or ideas what I can do.
Hope this wasn't too much, but I really have to get this off my chest."
depression,Group Chat,Is anyone in a chatroom that they can invite me in so that we can talk more?
depression,I haven’t taken my meds in a while,probably not good… but like idk i guess i kinda like it. this is self destructive i should take them. why do i do this to myself?
depression,I want friends so badly,But everytime  I try to talk to someone my mind goes completely blank. It's not that I'm not trying. I've been trying for so many months now. It's not getting better. I don't have the energy to socialize. I just feel like a zombie sometimes. When will this end? I feel so tired and exhausted to the point I can't even have friends :/
depression,I've given up,"Since childhood I've never felt truly happy. I thought I found it once and I ruined it. It destroyed me and I let myself slip into darkness. I was numb. Uncaring and selfish. I turned to drugs to cope. I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live. I was stuck in an emotionless twilight. At the time I didn't mind it because I didn't hurt anymore.

A few years back I got a new job and met someone there that I instantly fell in love with. It scared me. I tried to keep my keep my distance. I knew I would ruin it eventually. I thought it best to not drag anyone down with me. That was easier said than done. The more we talked the more I realized she understands the type of pain I'm going through. I let myself care about her. 

We finally expressed how we feel about each other and began dating. We both had our problems and knew what we were getting in to, at least I thought so. I struggled to overcome my addiction and learn to love again. I was honestly a really shitty partner in the beginning. I didn't communicate well. I was absent and distant. She stuck it through with me and I became a much better person. I owe it all to her. 

She was an alcoholic and when covid began she quit her retail job and spiraled out of control. It was a struggle. I worked 10-12 hour days 6 days a week. I would come home to her blacked out almost daily. I stuck with it. Doing whatever I could to help her overcome. She ended up in the hospital a few times and eventually tried an outpatient treatment program. It didn't help. After reaching out to her mother for advice she suggested inpatient. I was desperate to help her so I agreed. 

I didn't want her to be locked away like that but I didn't know what else to do. I'd tried everything up that point. Her mom gave her an ultimatum; go to inpatient willing, or have it court ordered. She went on her own. It didn't help. She came back even worse. Disturbed by all the horrifying stories she had to listen to while in there from other addicts.

She resented me for colluding with her mom. One day I come home from work and she wasn't home. That immediately struck me as odd and I tried to call and text her to no reply. Her phone was turned off. There was no note. Her things and car were still there but she had disappeared. I began searching her known hangout spots around a nearby river. Nothing. I was getting scared. I called her mom and she hadn't heard from her. We called the police and filed a missing person's report. They pinged her phone and it's last location was miles away. Sheriff's checked it out and nothing. 

The next day her mom tells me she heard from her. I was so happy to know she was alright. Then she told me she was with her abusive ex. I felt my heart shatter. Even still I tried to get a hold of her to understand what happened. She regretted her decision and explained she acted on a drunken impulse. She wanted to come home. I was upset but I understood addiction can make you do terrible things. I forgave her and went to get her. 

A couple weeks later she did it again. I was angry. Despite that I reached out to her to make sure she was alright. I wanted to know if this is what she truly wanted and if not I was willing to bring her home again. She eventually asked me to come get her. Once we got home I explained that this is going to take time to heal from. I still want us to be together but I'm very hurt. She apologized and eventually I was able to forgive her. 

Lately she's been so angry and resentful towards me for my behavior in the beginning of our relationship. She keeps bringing up past"
depression,Being traumatised by a depression..(?),"Hi guys,
First time posting here, but read over the years here and there some posts..
Well as in the title here my situation:

3 years ago I started analytic therapy, had a girlfriend that time and some heavy anxiety made things very difficult. (My father died when I was 14, which made it later then hard to love someone without fear)
Well it went really good actually till:
2020
The relationship was a lil toxic for me, it had a very polarising dynamic.. it made me depressive - September 2020 came along and one day to another it hit me with panic, cry attacks, mental breakdowns
I started taking medication, Elontril (US is wellbutrin or something).. it’s simply a Bupropion Derivate.. nevermind
It was heavy and after a long path of heavy pain I never experienced in my life before the relationship ended. Now since March a long and slow positive trend happened

I basically have no social anxiety what so ever. Talking to many people and going out actually helps me. I also have barely heavy self doubts. I like myself and I think I don’t deserve this depression at all.
My main thing is: Hopelessness.. that it is or will be chronic. That it never ends and I will end up having it forever 

I have a strong family and friends holding my back and all those actually positive things should make my depression way better or push me out of that..
But it doesn’t which worries me even more.

Now I experience a small downwards spiral again..(well I am studying physics and it’s stressful recently- so there might be the reason)


Now to my big worries (which may be part of depressive thoughts 🤷🤨)

The biggest cause of all my shit at the moment is a clearly noticeable wrong affection. I see something or feel something or smell something and a depressive feeling comes up.. no “I hate my self” or “I don’t deserve etc”. No thinking problem. Rather a feeling problem.
It is simply just that: my own reality seems heavily distorted and I am so good damn fucking afraid of another hell like late 2020.. it makes me panic to think about that happening again..
This depression traumatised more than anything in my distant past.. my depression gave me such a trauma, that it seems to stay. It induced it self..
And I have such a fear, that there is now solution to this at all.. 

I don’t see me as a person how is always struggling with depression 
It can’t be. I do except that I am in that position now and a part of me also thinks that every single soul on this planet can overcome an endogene Depression (non psychiatric) for good. Everyone must find there own way but I feel how this mental state fades recently and it gives me instant panic because depression-trauma.
Has anyone also such a concrete feeling of being traumatised by the depression itself?
Is there a way to deal with that. To break that circle?
(I have to add that I WAS a hypochondriac but psychoanalysis made it almost go away but I think it is focused now on the depression yall fee me? No idea how to deal with that)"

depression,I don’t like being a man; I don’t like being me,"     I really don’t know where to post this, but I just need to vent about it. So I went here. I hate everything about my body. I hate all of my body hair. I hate the shape. I hate any shred of masculinity. I’m not supposed to, though. I’m a man, and should be proud of my masculinity and I should act masculine. I hate these expectations. I’m only ever really happy with my appearance—or sometimes in general—when I’m wearing makeup or am feeling feminine. It’s been bugging me so much as of late. It’s been like this my whole life (to varying degrees), but it’s been getting worse and worse recently. I don’t really know what it is or why, but I’m kinda tired of it already. Usually I’m able to pretend like the person in the mirror is someone else, but lately I just can’t. I’m just glad I don’t hate women out of jealousy anymore lmao. I was in deep denial about whatever the fuck this is. If I kinda got through it before, I can do it again. I really wish I was born a woman, though. I’d be a lot more happier in general, I think. This thing isn’t pairing well with my depression and anxiety, either, nor my already pitiful self esteem. I don’t really see a point in life anymore, and it’s all just kinda meaningless to me, yet I care so much about what people think. I just wanna be happy and stay happy for once. Even just for a whole day. Not just for a minute of blissful ignorance.

     Sorry for venting. None of this is organized, so sorry about that too."
depression,I think this life isn't for me,"I have a really hard time to speak to other ppl irl,I have made multiple attempts to visit a psych but I end up never going there,I used to use gaming as a way to escape my depression or reality all together but also did the mistake of getting into long distance relationships that ended up really fucking bad...which left me traumatized from ever trusting anybody be it irl or online,I have no friends nobody I can talk to and I think even if someone would want to be my friend i would never accept or open up to them. I feel like I am stuck and there is no escape,I am 23 turning 24 next month,I feel like it's over for me,i'll die alone without friends or anyone by my side,dissapointing my parents by never getting married or having a kid,dissapointing anyone in my family by being not normal,everyone has told me i am not normal but what is being normal even?I am losing the fun in games,I am losing the last thing that is keeping me alive,what will happen to me if the games I used as a way to escape can't help me escape anymore?I'm convinced i am fucked"
depression,Failure is so painful,"I've been studying for a couple of years, got my BS diploma and am in the final bits of my master diploma as well. However, I won't be making it. I needed to just pass my internship but due to not being able to finish a report on time (after getting 3 extensions mind you) I got the message that I will be failing. 

After dealing with corona, studying through looking at my screen 24/7 feeling locked up in my room having to deal with my master thesis was already the worst feeling ever. But I also had to give up my parttime job to do the final internship in order to get my diploma and use up all my savings and I end up with a failure. I can't commit myself to another year of studies either because I dont have the money and I have about 80k in student debt. What the fuck do I do at this point? I've felt depressed for an entire year now and told myself ""just a little bit more"" until I would have made it but that just slipped away. I can't find a job with my bachelor diploma because the field I study requires at the very least an Msc so that diploma is complete and utter useless as well. I have just enough money to last another month and I still have another month of internship left (I got a month and a half extra time as extension to my internship due to me struggling with very basic things like reports..). I received an ultimatum and wasn't able to deliver. 

What do I do? Just no show? Find a job? End it all? What the fuck is the point of anything anymore."
depression,I feel like I live for grades.,"Honestly I don’t know when, how and why it started, but I have extreme fear I will fail. My parents are cool about it, nobody puts pressure in me, but I’m the one who says that I can’t fail in any way. Online school has really messed with me, I started cheating on tests(something I would NEVER do back in 2019), not because I didn’t study, but bcs I don’t trust or believe in myself. When I finish all exams I feel like there is no reason to exist, so I start studying even if the tests are 2 months later. I’ve been living this cicle for 16 years, and I’m tired of living, I constantly feel like dying is the only way I can rest. It sounds childish, I know, but every time I have to do an exam I start being anxious about it and think I won’t get a good grade, so I end up being desperate."
depression,I feel like I need to run away and call it quits,My direct deposit has been coming in late lately and it’s not much due to only working a little bit because of the pandemic. My account keeps going negative and each charge I get hit with a $35 fee so I now have 10 of those fees and every time my direct deposit gets put in I usually still am negative or only have a few bucks. My phone bill is due and they shut off my services because I didn’t pay it within 5 days. They can’t extend it and I can’t call the bank to see if they will reverse my overdraft fees due to the direct deposit. I’ll get paid Thursday or Friday but I’m already negative $350 and by then it will be around negative $500. Add in my check of $200-$300 I’ll still be negative and not be able to pay my bill. I feel like calling it quits with life is the only option right now. Verizon won’t help they say they can’t do anything.
depression,Everytime I think positively something unexpected comes and spoils it,"As title really, im going through a tough time within myself and my life at the moment but for years and years I came to realise that whenever I would look forward to something positive happening, like trying to make a change or improvement something comes along and spoils it. So I stopped being positive about things and instead tried to work towards it but in a much more suspicious way.

So for now for example I'm trying to find a new place to live (seperating from wife) and all seemingly good places I find are either snapped up too quickly or out of budget, and I'm just so down and negative that I can't keep away from thinking positively.

This means that because I'm in a bad place I can't see myself getting out of it, thinking of getting my life together just doesn't seem possible and I get down thinking that I'll end up living a miserable loveless lonely boring life, therefor depleting any drive I have to try, I've essentially just given up regarding working hard for something good and settling for whatever life throws my way 😪"
depression,"I never post anything in my family chat group because my rich and succesful brother overshares his accomplishments to an extreme amount, and now I'm the bad person","My brother is in his 30s, and he's rich and succesful exactly in the way society likes you to be. Healthy, good looking, long term partner, big house, and constantly overachieving at his job, always getting promoted, always looked for new challenges. I have never seen him fail at something. He has never been fired, never had trouble making friends, never been bullied, never had trouble finding relationships.

I'm in my twenties. I have autism and ADHD, and my life is a mess. I've never held a job longer than 6 months. I lived with roommates during college, but the pressure became to much and I had to move back home. I have a small group of friends I'm actually very happy with, but I had huge social issues in the past and I'm still definitely impaired in that area. I'm fighting HARD to get my shit together.

Now, we have a shared family group chat, and literally 90% of it is my brothers sharing his accomplishments. It's a never ending stream of vacation pictures, fancy work lunches, promotions, parties, etc at least once a day, often more. He'll be on vacation and post 20 pictures a day of what he's doing and how amazing everything is. And of course my parents drool over it.

At some point I just started tuning out and don't even read it anymore. They say Instagram is bad for your self esteem, but this is a million times worse. I seriously cannot take another smiling vacation selfie anymore without wanting to punch a wall or hurt myself. I truly want to be happy for their accomplishments and success, but it just eats away at me.

And people comment on it too; ""you never share anything"" ""you're not involved with the family"". I've talked about it before and basically got a response like, ""well you could at least be happy for others"". Yes, I try. It gets harder when the sharing never ever stops. They make me feel like I'm a bad person, while all I'm trying to do is preserve the last of my sanity and feeling of self worth before I go over the edge completely."
depression,I feel more useless then ever now,I’ve been reading post think that if no one is going to help me I’ll try to help someone. I was wrong. Reading through people’s post have made everything worse especially if it’s relatable. I can’t think of something to say without it be somewhat negative or less then useful. Why am I so useless?
depression,Why does the simplest thing become so difficult for depressed people?,"Activities as normal as getting up from bed, taking a shower, having a meal. It all seems so unwilling at times. Why is this? Is this merely because of the lack of motivation?"
depression,Fudge my life.," I want to feel emotion, I am Happy yet I am not. I forget it all in the moment. I have dreams, but is it really my dreams or that of someone else. I want to commit and focus on studying and improving myself but all I do is the opposite."
depression,It was a lonely day without you my friend.,"# My Short Story

It was a lonely day my friend. Everyday is just like this one. Where are you my friend? Are you busy again? Oh ok, we'll talk later then.

No I'm not busy, what's up? Today was rough for me too. I'll be here for you whenever you need my support. Anyways its been a while, how have you been lately? I'm glad that you're doing well.

I'm so sorry that you guys broke up, what you're feeling definitely isn't easy to deal with. Of course, I'm here to talk whenever you need somebody.

Of course I still love you, but not like that anymore. Thank you, but don't you think it's better if we don't talk with such affection like that anymore? After all, we've been apart for4 years now.

It's good to hear that you aren't too upset anymore. Did you maybe want to play some video games later or hang out? Oh you're busy? No problem. Just let me know if anything changes.

Hey what's going on? Sorry I'm kinda busy right now, but I can talk with you soon if you'd like. I'm sorry that you feel that way right now, but I'll always be free when you need to get something off your chest.

Hey, what are you up to today? Did you want to do something with me today? You're busy tonight? No problem, just let me know if plans change.

You needed to talk about something? I'm all ears, what's been bothering you? I can definitely understand the pain that you are feeling right now, and I applaud you for your strength. Let me know if I can do anything else for you.

It was a lonely day my friend. Everyday is just like this one. Where are you my friend? Are you busy again? Oh ok, we'll talk later then.

&amp;#x200B;

The main character of this story is me. The character to which I speak to is a great friend of mine. As I typed that, I realized that maybe this great friend isn't a friend after all. Why is it that I am always here to support you, but if I'm underwater, you couldn't care less? You say that you do care, yet your actions don't show it. I'm tired of feeling used. I wanted to go back to you not for the romance, but to actually be your friend. You mercilessly played with my feelings and you know this. And when I finally get the courage to say this, I'm the crazy one? Of course I know you're gaslighting me, but man does it still hurt. I did everything I could for you, but not one time did MY feelings ever matter to you. I'm having a hard time living, but what does it fucking matter. Every single time I tell anyone about something I struggle with, it doesn't fucking matter. All throughout my life almost everyone I have known has shown me that my feelings don't matter, and that they never will. It was a lonely day without you my friend. Everyday is just like this one. Where are you my friend? Are you busy again? Oh ok, we'll talk later then."
depression,Wish I had someone I could text while I was at my psychiatrist office.,"i am going for psychological testing my new psychiatrist wants me to do and it has me very nervous.

but I have no friends to text. Just wish I had someone I could text while at the dr's. in the waiting area and talk too, just to keep me company. but I don't have anyone."
depression,What should i do..?,"I am in my last year at school..i love chemistry and wanted to become a scientist..but then..now i lose all my hopes about future..i feel i will be all alone then and cant pay attention to my classes now nor have any interest towards anything..i feel my future is nothing more than a dead end..why work for it when i might be all alone and scared..i dont talk to anyone else much now..trying to prepare me for the alone time..my friends will be busy by then..i was good at academics and the ones who did less than me are working hard now to get into a good college..and i dont understand a thing about science in class,its all a blurr resulting in very low marks..i sleep and sleep all day bunking classes..i dont know what will happen if i continue this way..sometimes i feel come what may ,i should study bcos i loved learning new things..but then later i end up depressed and feel i wont reach anywhere..what should i do..please help me out.."
depression,Tired,"Nothing is right for me, no one is right for me, I’m not right for anybody, over the years I’ve realised I’d been becoming someone I feared becoming in the past. I feel like a toxic person cause I’m just done and detach myself from everybody I meet , I can’t keep panicking every time I meet new people. I hate being alone too. My mood keeps changing rapidly so chances are if I like spending time with u now I might just cut u off completely for a while because I keep having an existential anxiety crisis. And I don’t want to do that to ppl that are nice to me, cause that’s just gonna look like a dick move tbh. And I don’t really want to explain to them about what’s going on with me and actually make connections anymore. I guess I’m doomed"
depression,Am I the only one with unipolar depression?,I've had multiple depressive episodes through out my life and its getting to a point where it's hard to count on one hand. I'm only 23 and I feel like I'm the only one in the world with this many depressive episodes. How many times or how often have you been depressed?
depression,I feel like an empty shell,"That’s pretty much it, honestly. I’m a person who gets bored so, so easily; of books, games, shows, physical hobbies, and even, or especially, people.


Nearly everything I’ve had a consistent obsessive interest in has to do with psychology or neuroscience, all so I could find out *something* about myself. The Thing. Answers. Relief. But really, I’m just… normal, boring, with extremely unrealistic expectations. 


It’s like I’m a broken bucket, no matter what and how much I add to my life, I’d be left with nothing. Within hours. A few days if I’m lucky.


Sure, I feel lonely, but I have damn good friends, we’re close, we connect so well. I have a great support system. Yet, I’m more likely to avoid all that. Because it’s not stimulating enough, or perhaps not stimulating in the right ways, nothing personal. What are the right ways? Absolutely no idea. 


At the end of that day, I find myself back to the void, whether I’m pulled back into it forcefully or… idk, I sought it out myself out of fear, seeking familiar comfort, doesn’t really matter. 


Oh I know, this will pass, something will spark my interest eventually, but I will come back to the emptiness after.


It’s a cycle, clearly, and I’m simply so very tired of reliving it and being stuck."
depression,A clear solution to depression?,"Getting up early and also activity during the day appears to be the single measure that helps to determine your level of depression. The later you get up and the less active you are the more severe is your level of depression. I wish you could quantify or measure the sources and causes of depression and also implement an effective strategy or helpsystem that effectively reduces symptoms (i.e. lethargy, suicidal thoughts), elevates mood and improves life quality on the long run. 

these factors play along...

- repetitive negative thoughts / believes
- altered behaviour 
- changes in neurotransmitter levels 

I don't know if you can agree but, because of negative thoughts one/you/I don't do or avoid the things that make one happy otherwise. You are basically suppressing your actions (intuitive impulses that would otherwise lead you on an alternative path) and conversely end up depressed. 

But how do you stop listening to the ""NO, it is not worth it"" and keep changing your perspective and mindset. This is the part that I find the most challenging.

Effectively you have to change your thought patterns and behaviour (since CBT)

What are the strategies, how do you apply them, what are your stories... ?"
depression,Sometimes I feel like being an animal would be a better option.,Ever feeled like your life has led you to nothing? Why am I born in to this body anyways. Beean asking this question asbling as i can remember. Being an animal who just lives and is not intercepted by human nature seems like so much more fun. You wouldn't have that much worries... Responsibilities reduced to the slightest. And no must and should induced in your life in any way. It feels romantic and so free. I dunno why i even post this...
depression,Desperately need someone to talk to please,"I'm not okay. Haven't been for a while. I have an overwhelming feeling of sadness, hopelessness, suicidal ideation. Don't want to deal with a counselor right now. If you're up for casual companionship with a troubled person,  I could really use a friend. 30 year old female. Thanks in advance"
depression,What is wrong with me?,"Hey! I don't know if I'm on the right subreddit, so I just ask you guys. I don't know what's wrong with me. I barely enjoy things anymore, I can't motivate me to do anything. For example: I'm overweight and I really want to lose weight and eat healthier but I can't  motivate myself to get up. I can't even enjoy Movies and Video games as much a I used to. Most of the time I just want to lay on the couch and smoke weed.
I don't have any friends either, so I don't have a lot of people I can talk to. I don't know what to do anymore."
depression,Kids make it worse,"God damn it! 
I woke up this morning, I haven't even had the chance to get out of bed and my kids are telling me that they need lunch money. It takes a lot of convincing that my account says they have money, and it'll take a few hours for it to reflect in their accounts. 
Then one has to come and say that his new shoes are hurting his heal. Well, he hasn't worn anything but Crocs for a long time, yeah it's going to hurt, but it'll be better soon. No I can't afford to go buy you another pair of expensive shoes. 
Then my husband gets involved and is taking the kids side in everything.
The short story is, is that I hate my life. I don't have a desire to kill myself right now, but I have hundreds of intrusive thoughts every day that day otherwise. 
All I want is to be away from all of them. I should have never had kids. I don't even get the privilege of having 'normal' kids. I snap and I yell and make everyone around me miserable. 
I hate myself like none other. 
I just wish I could get a disease, or get in an accident and die."
depression,Always trying to get out of responsibilities.,"I am 17. I go to school and I work. those are my two responsibilities. Almost everyday i am trying to find another excuse to not go to either. It’s not that i even hate school (i mean no one likes it, but i’m not running from it) i just have no motivation. i want to make money. i need to save, i need to work. I’m always trying to call off or get my shifts covered. Sometimes i’ll be having a wonderful day at school and then i get some sudden urge to go home, and so i do just that"
depression,I've lost motivation and I'm not sure what to do.,"Okay, so recently I've found myself not doing anything, I'll just sit around and do basically nothing for hours. Is there a way to move past this? More and more I find things I once enjoyed don't interest me and I'm losing all motivation to even leave my room. I've spoken to doctors and I've been told that I've got really bad stress and anxiety but I'm not sure why I'm stressed and I fear that's contributing to my stress. Does anyone have any ideas on help?"

depression,"It gets better, until it doesn't, but no one wants to hear that side of the story.","It gets a little better, and then it gets so much worse again. Some of us never reach the end goal of recovery, and so we're never able to integrate into society or connect with others, and so we feel further isolated, exacerbating our already fragile mental health.

I don't think I'll ever break free from this. I cry and self-harm a lot because I've learned I have no real support, not even from professionals, who've frequently admitted that they don't know how to help me. I hate hearing advice because I've tried it all before and nothing helps. Nothing works. The only thing that 'works' is self-isolation. I don't want to be alone, it *hurts*, but if I can't get any better, then I deserve this, instead of bothering people with my problems who don't even care or should not be expected to care as this is beyond them. I'm mostly invisible by default, in any case.

Sure, people find me attractive, but it doesn't matter because they're either not good people or aren't the people for me. Sure, people think I'm sweet, but it doesn't matter because those people just exploit my kindness and eat me alive. Sure, people think I'm interesting, but it doesn't matter because they never stay when they hear I have so many disorders and run since my existence is a red flag. I don't blame them.

I read that people like me deserve to be alone, all the time. And of course we are. Who would want us? I do receive and get help, but clearly I'm still struggling. It's not enough. Nothing is ever enough. So I do feel unwanted. People make me feel unwanted. And don't get me wrong. I deserve it, if I'm not able to get better. I wish I could. I try my best, but who would've thought 'going to therapy', 'taking meds' can only do so much, even if you put the work in? Some people are seriously messed up due to the things they've dealt with. I'm sadly one of them. That's all there is to it. And I don't want to hear 'it gets better' anymore. I'm tired of the bs. I'm tired of the lies.

I feel guilty for existing. I'm too weak for this world and would happy to be gone. But I'm trapped here and have to face myself and a reality that despises me yet couldn't care less about me at the same time."

depression,I’m debating doing something completely crazy so I can actually feel something other than emptiness.,"At this point, idk I just want to do something completely out of the ordinary. I told my boyfriend of nearly 5 years that I’m thinking about running away and eloping. I’m 25 and somehow my mind has never developed past teenage years. I still feel like a teen. Always focusing on responsibilities and being obedient. As a child, I was abused into submission and I guess it never left. I’ve lived safe and obedient for a long time. For once I want to do something dumb I guess lol."

This has been going from 2020 till now 2021 and i feel like im gonna die

Gender: Female
Age: 10

depression,What’s that feeling called? And why do I feel so affected?,"I didn’t know where to ask because I’m not sure if anyone has felt this way but what’s that feeling where you look at a spot where there was a good time with friends, family etc but when they all leave, the silence is oddly loud and you’re just left alone when awhile ago you were having a good time. It just hits me hard when I see empty spots my friends and family sat in and I’m just by myself."
depression,I just want to rant for a bit about my life.,"So I got a new job early June because my old workplace was getting really toxic even though I loved it but I just knew it was time for me to go for certain reasons I won't get into. This new job i got is kind of similar to Trader Joe's, and I thought it was a start of a new journey and it's a fresh breath of air. I get paid a lot more, I am given a lot more hours, and there are bonuses that come with the job as well. 
 The excitement didn't really last long. I'm not treated very well there. I try to do my best and excellency with everything but a few coworkers of mine including a manager start to belittle me and treat me like I'm dumb and like I'm a five year old. 
They aren't nice at all. It's not like I am rude or treat them negatively, I actually go to work with my very best and I try to be nice and kind to everyone. When I ask questions, I have been told that ""I need to think"" and ""that I need to use my brain"" and that ""I'm clearly not trained properly"" when there's something I don't understand. And when I try to reach to manager about it I'm told that those people that said those to me are just like that and I need to not let it get to me. 
But it is getting to me. I'm just more than a month in and I've cried so much at work, and dreaded going in, and overall this workplace has made me go back to a really bad depressive episode. I'm in a position too where I can't leave yet and I have to suck it up and wait, so right now there's nothing I can really do but hold on tight and tell myself that this will only be temporary. But it's getting seriously hard to go on. I want to move out but I can't yet. I feel really trapped and I can't breath. It seems like I'm the only employee too that gets treated like this. 
 That's all for my rant. Thank you for listening."
depression,I just want everything to be over,"I'm a 20 year old guy, I've been dealing with depression for a couple years now, but as of the last few months it's just gotten worse and worse. I'm too tired to go into the full story, but in short, I dropped out of school, lost 2 jobs, my parents have given up on me and think I'm useless, and my girlfriend of 1 year recently left me, which still hurts the most out of everything.


I've been talking to therapists and taking medication, but nothing helps. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can't distract myself with anything to make me happy. Things I used to love, video games, music, now it's just nothing. 

I'm just so overwhelmed right now by everything. I have barely gotten out of bed in the last month. Out of all the problems and shit I have going on, the most I can think of is my now ex-girlfriend. I miss her so much and it's killing me.

I used to think I could be something different in life, but now I'm just ready for it to be over. The reasons to hold on are slowly fading away. I don't want to kill myself, I just want everything to be over with. I forgot what it's like to go to bed and wake up happy."

depression,i don’t feel the the rays of sunshine anymore,"im having the worst day,
maybe even going thru the worst part of life rn 

every day i wake up and i know i failed everyone and am failing myself but some how i can’t manage to get my shit together to save myself. i have a PhD but im dumb as a rock and didn’t even pull the thousand out of the air to take my board exams. I do good on studying for a week or two and then it goes down the drain and I lose my track and I have to start over. I’m swimming in debt from student loans, and when I’m home I’m either getting shamed for not spending every minute studying (when I don’t even think I can do quality studying in my room) or being pressured to care for my family and provide hot meals daily since I’m so available as I’m also not working. One minute it’s when r u going to take ur test, and the next it’s good thing you’re not working bc ur granny needs you (in the months since ive graduate she’s had a pace maker removed and then went back in after recovering for a hip replacement). at one point I questioned if god was delaying my progress for a year so I could help everyone else, but not truly help myself.

the icing on the cake was maybe being in splitsville after arguing w my emotionally abusive bf today and on the drive home my car started shaking and flashing engine lights. so now i have that burden to add to my never ending list of emotional and then also very very real problems. I don’t know if we’ll be on bad terms for too long as my bday is Tuesday, but I’m also kind of dreading that day bc my family will want to go out to eat to be nice to me and money is so tight. I told myself if I ever ran into good money and could work and be stable, I would make a promise w god that I would be the one to pay for my bday dinner and host it myself so no one has to worry and I would bear that for everyone so they can at least get some kind of joy out of coming out to celebrate me. but what’s there to even celebrate about me, no one is proud of me as I’m a year delayed in my career, but I guess they like me as a person since we’re all family.

honestly, i don’t even think i was meant to live long. part of me has always thought i had too many problems to live for much longer. I wonder if I’ll be able to live one day and not have a dark cloud over me.

i thought maybe I could get a part time and save to kind of uplift myself, maybe I could get my studying in tack but it’s been a year and I’m deep in the hole i dug for myself. I don’t know how I’ll get around now and I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.

how can I pick myself up from this"

I just don’t know what to do anymore …💔😣
depression,It isn't worth fighting it,"So for some context. I'm a trans woman (19) and I can be ok ish passable. Most the time I can pass fine. But off I have dysphoria, I've been molested a lot as a kid, physically abused, almost raped, ect ect. While I have a great family. I deal heavily with bi polar, and depression mixed with ADHD. Sometimes I feel like things are on top of the world and that I can do anything. But them... A lot or most the times I get like this. Where my emotional downs are so deep that my chest physical hurts. That I can go even months without showering (covid and stuck at home so it's easy to forget). Or even just feed myself good food. I've been stuck here in a place where there's nothing but proud boys and other far right groups who would love to get the chance to hurt me. I was supposed to be in cali last year but covid happened. I'm going there in the fall but tbh. Knowing I'll live life like this? It's not worth it. I hate that everyday it feels as if I'm hanging on to this piece of wood drifting in the middle of an ocean. And sometimes storms come and try to drown me. It's a constant state of fighting to just survive. I mean when it gets to the point where you wanting to pee is considered a political statement. And that people want to call you a pedophile for just wanting to pee ... What's the point? I mean I'm always going to fight for my life so why even try? My chest hurts so much it legit feels as if my heart is gone and I feel such a deep pain I can't do anything. I want to end it all but for some reason my instinctual need to live is preventing me. But I can't stop thinking about how nice it would be to just end it all. I have no friends irl. I'm my current situation I'm forced to wait to move before I can make friends irl. With all this past traumatic experiences and ptsd I choose terrible friends who further contribute to my depression. I have no love for myself. I fall in love with anyone. It's so bad I miss the fact when I was a kid at least older men would want my attention. Nothing is worth it anymore. I have pages and pages of suicide notes because it helps the pain but I have a full notebooks worth already. I can't do this. Why should I do this? Because some select group of people will miss me? Because my dog will be heart broken? Idk if that's enough anymore. I'll never be a ""woman"" in my eyes. And even with a bit over a decade of therapy my ptsd isn't gone. My trauma still heavily affects me. Idk what to do. I want to fix it but genuinely I've done everything. I want love anything. I want to do anything other then what I am now. I dream of waking up as a cis woman. I've begged and begged whatever and whoever might listen (I'm an atheist but at this point I'll beg any god or gods at night just so I can cry). To just be given the opportunity to be a woman. I just want a restart. My life was doomed from the start. I have so much hate for this world. And while I'm a huge humanitarian and could never be pushed to a mass shooter level. I just have the hate that makes my entire body shake. That in my mind I can't wait for all these fucks to die. But then I realize that they'll always be terrible people and I'll always be the freak. I won't ever have redemption. They'll never be justice or even revenge. I'll never be equal to anyone. I'm only writing this here because I broke my only pencil writing my last note which is fucking 4 pages long. This is a cry for help. Which ultimately won't mean shit. Because it's not like some internet strangers can genuinely offer any advice on how to magically fix all my issues so I can finally try a normal life. But at least I can cry it out here so I can finally get so tired I pass out. Then rinse and repeat for a month or however my depression last."
depression,I feel like I’m faking it,"I always feel like I’m faking it and doing it for attention
Like I talk to a friend about my problems, or post about it and I feel like I’m faking it because my brain says “oh tell them this and blah blah you’ll get actually attention for once” or something, or sometimes I am still happy about stuff or enjoy things or I feel like nothings fun anymore and that’s probably just me being Lazy.
I don’t have it as bad as other people so I just feel like I’m faking it all the time because why else would I be sad about everything going on? It’s hard to describe but it just feels like everything i’m doing is for attention and I don’t know what to do about it.
Everyone says that if I’m worried about this I’m probably not a attention whore, or maybe I do want attention but in a “I need help please” way but I don’t know that doesn’t makes me feel better.

I just lost money which was a bulk of my savings, gone. Why don't i just smash my head into the wall? I'm dying more and more everyday. I just want to get addicted to heroin and OD on the best stuff on earth (allegedly)."

depression,My piece of advice if you feel lonely at times,"If you're far away from home, in an unknown place without any friend. Embrace loneliness ! 

I used to be lonely af when I was in college. I'm gonna be lonely next year because I move to a city far away from home where I don't have any acquaintance. 

My piece of advice : be independant. Of course it's easier if you have a car, a job and a good salary. But just embrace loneliness. You're on your own in a place where you don't know everyone ? All you can see around you are crowded bars with laughing gangs of friends. So what ? Take your coat, walk in the streets of your city, go to the swimming pool, to the cinema. Take your car or the train. Go away. If you're blue, alone in your flat on a sunday evening, well take your car / train and go to the nearest big city/seaside resort/... 

You're independant. Lions are walking alone. You're free. Just enjoy this freedom. You don't need any friend to do so."
depression,Suicidal but no immediate danger,"I'm suicidal, but I'm not the usual suicidal person. 
I wish to die. 
But I don't feel the need to die. 
If anything, death isn't what I truly want. 
What I want is to end everything. 
Doesn't have to be death. 
If I could, I want to forget everything, including who I am. 
Though if im still stuck with the same toxic family and living in the same toxic environment, then I guess forgetting wont solve anything. 
If possible, I want to erase myself, my existence as a whole. 
If I never existed, then everything wouldn't matter anymore. 
I'm suicidal, but I don't have a definite plan to kill myself. 
Im just always thinking about death, thinking that I'd be better off dead, and thinking that I'm so tired that I just wish everything would end. 
I'm suicidal, but I'm not the proactive type. 
Im the passive type.
I have a tendency to neglect myself and be reckless. 
There have been times when I was driving and for a moment, I let off the gas. 
There were times when I was not feeling well and needed to take meds, knowing fair well the correct amount to take, I would recklessly take more for stronger affects without a care for the possible consequences.
There were also times in which I was legitimately dying due to a severe allergy attack and was reluctant to call for help or go to the hospital, in the end, I was in ICU for a couple 12 hours and hospitalized for 4 days. 
You're probably wonder whats going on in my head. 
My thoughts are simple.
I simply thought: 
""In the worst case scenario, I will die. But since death is actually a desirable outcome, so why bother?"" 
But I do have thoughts, thoughts of committing suicide in the far future when I'm living on my own, away from my family. I have thoughts of just one day, without leaving a letter or anything, not crying or devastated, simply because I felt like it, I would kill myself. 
Im only living because I'm being pushed to.
But life is so tiring. 
Everything, even breathing requires effort. 
So my point is: 
Even though I'm suicidal, I don't plan to kill myself any time soon, but I also don't expect myself to live till old age. I most definitely won't last that long. Who knows, but living up till age 30 doesn't sound bad. I've still got 9 more years, a bit long if I may say. I wonder if I'll live up to 30?"
depression,A facade,"23 and nothing more than a husk of a human. How do you explain to someone the only reason you haven’t killed your self is so that your family can live the lie that is your life. A facade put on for the ones you “care” for so they can enjoy the empty shell that you’ve become. A smile created for others peace of mind but more false than a carnival mirror. The yearning for the sweet release from this torment that I endure for others everyday. I’m growing tired, I feel like I’ve lived for 10 lifetimes. The days pass and the world grows grey and cold."

depression,Do you feel a lottery win would help you out of your depression?,"It's all I dream about.  I'm mostly depressed because a lack of money has me stuck, and I cant make money because all of my problems are preventing me from doing so.  Money would buy me a car, driving lessons,  some needed dental work, foot surgery, fix the physical things I am insecure about, therapy, help for my vision problems, migraine treatments, the ability to move away, a house that is not falling apart with a damp and mould problem, a properly functioning toilet, a cooker.  I feel it would put me in a happier place, and I could make friends, have a partner, a family. 

Anyone feel the same, or do you feel it would make your life worse?"
depression,I don’t know if I can love,"I 19 yr (f) joined a dating app to see if I could finally find someone I like, and I met a really nice guy and we’ve been talking for the past week.

I’ve tried to have a relationship one time before and I broke it off quickly cause I felt the  same as I do now. He flirts and idk what to say back, I thought this is what I wanted but I just wanna cry because I can’t feel anything towards him. I barely feel anything at all most of the time. I wanna tell him this before he tries to get into a relationship with me but I’m scared I’ve dragged this out. I know it’s been a week and he lives somewhere else so it’s not a huge deal but he’s super nice and I don’t wanna upset him. I feel like I can’t love anyone. It’s already hard with my friends and family because I feel so emotional gone. I don’t know what to do anymore I feel stuck and like my life is gonna stay this way. If anyone has any advice please comment."
depression,I want to wake up with terminal cancer because I'm tired of my fucking life,"I have no excitement in my fucking life, I have no friends, lost my job, people keep lying to me, every hobby I try to be interested in, life fucks it for me. Oh I went to the gym and I stayed consistent at it? Going everyday? That was my only happiness, well guess what motherfucker, closed because of covid. Oh I enjoyed someone's company and I like them? Well, they leave me and never talk to me again. You started a course on something you love doing and you plan to make a career out of it? The teacher literally scams us by not showing up to class for months now and the school does nothing about it.

Why is it like this for me? It's like god wants me to fucking rot in my house all day, my summers are awful, I spend them all at home, my family doesn't go on vacations and even if they did, I wouldn't go with them, they are more depressing than I am, I don't want to be negative and complain all the time, that's why I enjoyed the gym so much, it made me so happy and gave me something to do but now it's gone.

I don't want to study or workout at home, I honestly spent most of my fucking life in my room, I have no social life, I've worked before and I actually lost my job because I got covid. 

My problem isn't money, my problem is that I'm so lonely all the time and I feel really unlucky guys, I don't know when I'm gonna meet a person that wants to be my friend in real life for real, that has to be first, let alone wanting someone who would want to date me but I am so used to getting rejected, no one really being interested in me both in friendships or relationship, I am so used to having a crush on a girl and her not liking me back at all, not even wanting to be friends with me, every person I like as a friend never wants to be my fucking friend.

And fuck that, before you say I'm negative, I'm so cheery all the time, I laugh, I smile so much when I'm outside with people, I invite them to do things, eat new food, do activities, I propose things to do but I get a no all the time, I just want to be given a chance that's all really

And to be honest with you folks, the only person I am negative to is myself, I tell myself bad things, my head is literally a bad neighborhood but I am the best version of myself IRL with people but yet they never want to hang out with me, I bought a camera, I am so interested in photography and yet I couldn't find a single person to help me practice portraits or just hang out with me while I take pictures.

God, the only thing I need is a bullet, a gun and I'll end my fucking life, no hesitation."
depression,Tryna get my life back on track,"These past 2 years have been some of the hardest years of my life. Dealing with severe acne destroyed my life. Even after a year of dealing with the painful mental and physical side affects of acne I was left with these hideous scars. Through it all I secluded myself, abandoned relationships, and gave up on my sports career. Everyday I laid on my bed wishing I was dead. I felt as if my life had no direction and meaning. I lost everything. I felt like i could never be loved or have anyone understand my pain. My mind tormented me like a demon. If I didn’t try to make a change I would have put a bullet in my skull. Enough was enough this past month I made a change. i repaired a series of broken friendships and am trying to get back into sports. The pain hasn’t gone away  but I have nothing left but to keep moving forward. I don’t know where I’m going to end up but I hope everything turns out well in the end."
depression,An I depressed?,"Hey. I am a 21 year old who battles OCD and Anxiety. I tend to always think I have a physical or mental health problem due to my health anxiety. However, I wondered if maybe this is different. I am a strong guy. Although I battle OCD (perfectionism OCD) and anxiety, I always enjoy going out with my friends (even if it is harder nowdays due to anxiety), and I never have a hopeless outlook on life. I may get stressed but I always pick myself up and lift my spirits when I do. I smile in the day and enjoy things such as football, meditation and seeing my friends. These are my passions. I must say I do find it hard to do stuff as much now, as the idea of soing it perfectly and the anxiety that goes with it can lead to hours of procrastination. But I understand thats normal. However it is this inability to do stuff I used to that makes me scared. As I understand anohedia or whatever is a symptom. However, I must state - I am still passionate about these things. Just may find it harder to sit down and work. My personal hygeine and sleep is relatively normal, as I do not ever sleep way too much or none at all. My brain’s high cortisol can wake me up early hours sometimes - but I can always just get back to sleep and get rougly normal hours in (usually between 6-8 hours a night). I must say I am never hopeless on life - always hopefull I can recover from OCD and anxiety. Please let me know what u think !"

I was fine for a while but then I started getting irritable. Now feeling more hopeless. Thankfully my suicidal ideation hasn't returned, but I fear it might. I used to constantly think about ways to kill myself or have a voice telling me to do it. I don't want them to come back. Trying to calm down. I hate being like this. I just want to be level-headed again. I feel like I'm losing myself."
depression,Oh well,I’m pretty sure I just had some kind of mental breakdown or psychotic break or something. Idk. That was...really scary. I feel tired. I’m not sure I’m fully out of it yet. I genuinely can’t tell if I’ve done this before. It doesn’t feel like I’ve had this particular feeling but there have been times where I’ve been this upset. It feels like I’m crazy. Like I can’t trust anything I think or feel. Like nothing I thought I knew is real. I wonder if I have some sort of delusional disorder. I had to look it up but I didn’t come to any kind of conclusion. I have no idea. I hope it’s gone by tomorrow. I have to do chores tomorrow and I’d rather be able to do them without breaking down in front of my family.
depression,Not sure what is wrong but I hate this,"It's another one of those chainsmoking kind of nights lads and lasses and everything outside in between.

I wake up I go to work I eat a meal a day sometimes and then I just sit there awake it's 4:30 in the morning right now there's nothing there there's nothing left I no longer have anything to keep me going. I used to just play games or hang out with my friends but they've all either gone or I'm just not happy with them I don't want to bring them down with my bad mood. I stopped drinking because I'm self-aware enough to realize that that's only putting more poisons into my body that are going to kill me but honestly what's the harm in that even if it only makes me feel good for a temporary bit of time it's something I wouldn't even say feel Good Just feel something. I don't know what's wrong. This has actually been happening for years now nothing fixes it and the thought of living the rest of my life like this is horrifying I dread it. What does Reddit think, and don't give me some bullshit about everything gets better you just got to live with yourself. Just give me a straight answer does it really get better or is that something we just tell ourselves?"
depression,Hey,"Not sure where to start but here’s another one of those posts. 

I think I’m broken 

I’m depressed&amp;anxious

I’m so frustrated and caught up all the time 

and I’m sad?
Passed few months I’ve barely been feeling sadness. I just feel emotionless. Lost I guess 

Im not sure what to say but tonight I just feel broken 

My childhood was broken 
My young teens were self breaking because of my mind
My young adulthood is terrifying(as for everyone) and just so static 

Tonight I feel broken and I think it’s the first time I’ve felt this words meaning 

As I mentioned this. I don’t know how to explain my emotions these passed couple months. Just emotionless and numb in a way I guess 

Yeah forsure I have a great time in situations and I’d say I’m happy in those moment fooooorrrrsure . But deeply, I think I’m broken . Probably maybe perhaps 

I don’t know myself and wish I did , I’m lost

I know I don’t have to say this cause there’s no reason but something in me just wants to say I’m sorry, so I am, I’m sorry , and I wish I wasn’t 

It’s so hard for me to put things in place because my mind builds walls around stresses and it’s so weird, I don’t understand  

I know I’m a nice guy, and don’t do anything wrong hopefully but I really do feel like a horrible person 

I hat this and by the end of this text, there’s a shimmer of felling defeat within my brain 
Aren’t brains so weird? 

I hope your well as you can be today and tomorrow and never set feet off this earth until 95 

Peace , much love"

depression,"how do you come to terms with the fact that you're going to be like this for the rest of your life, and that the majority of your peers will never go through that?","disclaimer that i know i should be optimistic and that having such a shitty mindset like the title implies is Not Good, but i feel like i deserve to want to know the answer to that question and to think abt it because i am probably going to be like this for the rest of my life, unless a switch suddenly flips the moment i set foot on a university campus (am focused on passing the exams necessary to even get to that point rn 👍👍)

i feel like the title is pretty self explanatory. it's been hitting me a lot recently (thanks to uni talk and the fact that exams are too close and soon and upcoming etc etc) that i've kind of just been progressing at an inanely slow ""stop being crippled by depression go to your classes wake up in the morning now"" rate. i know that progress is progress and that i've made an insane amount of it these past five years.

i'm proud of myself for that, and grateful to myself for sticking it out for so long and so far. but it's really hard to remember that, and it feels pathetic to think things like ""i wake up in the morning and can get out of bed before 8. i eat 3 meals a day at normal times. i force myself to not self-isolate during classtime because ik it'll make me feel worse. i did seek psychiatric help i just currently have no time outside of class for it"" when your peers are literally international gymnastic champions, national winners and other miscellaneous achievements.

while i'm aware that my school pushes their students to be the best and that's the reason why it feels like every week i hear about another dozen achievements done in the name of this school, and that the majority of people are not insanely talented, they're just people who are doing averagely well and excelling in stuff they're good at and have an interest in. 

but i still resent that. not all the times, i've just recently kept on getting stuck on the incredibly self absorbed thought (self awareness lmao) that it's so fucking unfair to me that that i have to live life like this. that i have to embody depression to the point where even the most ""depression isn't real lmao"" person has to go ""yeah you have serious issues and they obstruct and affect your life everyday, on a daily recurring basis"" (before going ""but also you still go to your classes and wake up in the morning so no lol depression isn't real), while the majority of my peers won't. 

i don't want my peers to suffer or have to feel like shit everyday, or for my whole year level to have trouble focusing in 90% of their classes. i just feel so angry and upset that i have to be like this, that i can't be better. that i've lived like this and that i'm going to keep on living like this. like some stupid disadvantage that i have to push against everyday just to wake up, just to do things, and even then i fail. i procrastinate on assignments, i cry because it's really fucking hard sometimes, and then i put in herculean efforts to get the work down in time. it just feels so unbearably unfair sometimes."

depression,Grew up with exposure to trauma and I have no idea how to move forward,"I was diagnosed with complex childhood trauma about a year and a half back and generally, things are a stark improvement after I’ve moved out from my family home. But even in good periods like this, I often struggle with trying to comprehend what went wrong, and how I can fix myself.

I grew up around violence, sexual assault and emotional abuse/ manipulation. It’s still hard to figure things out, even with medication, therapy and self-journaling. Even when I’m in a good place, I still get lost. The problem is such a big picture that I often don’t know where to start mending, if it makes sense.

I’ve been using tarot cards to help with my own introspection and thoughts (and it’s been very very helpful), and my therapist also approves of the way I’ve been trying to heal, on top of our regular appointments. But I don’t know, days like these just pop out, I suppose."

&amp;#x200B;

This year became the worst one in my life. tl;dr, my (now) ex boyfriend lost feelings towards me and broke up with me, found new girlfriend few weeks after. Now I have to move out to a new place (we share house) because he can't handle me being upset and it's a bit awkward. 

I'm moving out next week and it's very scary for me. 

I used to be happy. Of course I had my problems and such but I considered myself a happy, cute, bubbly person with passions. Now I feel like an empty shell of a human. 

This whole situation made me very depressed and miserable. Anxiety is killing me and I spend most of my days in bed. I got antidepressants, therapy, been calling helplines but it feels like I'm not making much progress. I felt bad to the point where I self harmed for the first time in my life. I felt like I wasn't myself and was very scared after I realised what I've done, ended up at A&amp;E day after. I've been having a bit of suicidal thoughts too.

I wish I could have dealt with this situation better. I'm so worried about myself :("

Want friends, want to be invited places. Have nothing. 
Trying to escape the toxic people and they just make more abusive comments.

I’m here to ask for help as to what I should do with my friends. I like them but they always pick on me especially as it gets laughs from everyone and it has become a common thing to do and even was referred to as a “trend” I don’t like to go out and meet new people as I’m very anti social so that’s why I stick to the ones I have but it’s very draining and I’ve been putting up with it for awhile but now it’s beyond a joke.

depression,I'm tired of pretending to be okay,"Using a throwaway because I don't feel comfortable having this in my post history, hope that doesn't break any rules.

I don't have anyone in my life I feel safe talking to about any of this. Okay so here it goes...

I'm 30 and I never learned how to drive because I have a phobia of driving. This has made everything in my life so much harder. I didn't go to college and I don't work because of how hard it is to get around. Having no education or money has basically tanked my self worth. I feel extremely isolated. 
Up until earlier this year I had been living with my mom. But it was decided within the family I would move several states away to live with my brother and his wife. I was given only the illusion of choice in this matter, so now I'm far from everything I was familiar with. 

My brother and his wife are being very generous and patient in letting me live here. However some days it's abundantly clear they find me burdensome, even some days being downright cold and callous towards me. Living with my brother's wife in particular is challenging because she's a very extroverted outgoing person, and as you can imagine I am not.
Over the last few months she has introduced me to so many people she works with or is friends with. And inevitably they all end up asking me the same questions, ""what do you do?"" ""what are your plans now?"" ""are you enjoying living here?"" 

And each time I am asked these questions I have to answer something that is deemed socially acceptable. Because no one wants to hear about how completely miserable I am or how the thought of a job terrifies me because I feel too damn stupid to do anything. 

It's gotten to the point where I have stopped sleeping. At night I curl up in bed and cry as silently as I possibly can. 
I feel so hopeless and alone, and I'm not really sure what to do anymore."

depression,Hope... Where do you find it?,"Im having a massive relapse today. I thought I was getting better this week- I went out two times with friends and had a really good time. But Saturday came along and I just felt so depressed the entire day. It's 4AM as I type this and everything that I tried to avoid just came right back. I smoked weed again. I binged video games. I went down a rabbit hole I hopelessly tried to get myself out of. 

Anxiousness in the future creeped up. It was always in the back of my mind but right now it's all I'm thinking of- climate change and Delta variant of covid. I'm trying my best against these problems. I try to eat less meat, drive less, and pay carbon offsets to help climate change. I'm vaccinated and wear masks outside. But no matter what I do there seems to be no end to it. New climate disasters everyday, new climbing covid cases... IDK what to do. 

How do we find hope when it seems like we're giving our all but outcomes don't seem to go our way."
depression,"I (28F) want to fast forward in time and be able to say ""It's been a year since I started having suicidal thoughts everyday, I'm better now!""","Sometimes, I feel like I don't care anymore. Throw away everything, let misery eat up my life. But there are times like these that I feel so bad for myself because I'm still hoping I'll get better. I want to get out of this phase asap. But sometimes, it also gets too comfortable and I'm far too distant from reality again. It's too confusing and I don't know what to do anymore. It's exactly how they say it: not being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I don't think there is much for me anymore. I seriously think I wouldn't be able to achieve peace ever again because of the demons inside of me. I'm still able to grab onto some little joys, though, and I'm glad for that. But we all know they don't last. 

I am afraid of seeking help and I don't know why. I can't even define where on the spectrum my situation falls, if I'm really getting worse or I'm just over exaggerating. 

I just desperately need someone to talk to. I don't know. I'm desperate for anything. Desperate for something better. Something other than what is *here.*"

depression,Does Intervention Work?,Friends held an intervention for me. They all have a lot of other issues but they seem to focus on me. I relapsed and don't know what to do.

depression,Burden of being the eldest child.,"I'm in my early 20s and am the eldest child of the family. Parents are major alcoholics that have severe co-morbidities like PIVD and heart issues.

I find myself often having to take care of them and worrying about the future because I have 2 younger siblings. At times,  I help pay the bills with the little amount of money I receive as merit scholarship. This often results in me being unable to save up money and my parents do not give me any allowance unless I'm away at college. Rn due to the pandemic,  we're all locked at home w online classes.

This has affected me severely as I have to shoulder responsibilities and worry about the future. I've also had depression and severe anxiety for the past 4 and 1/2 years. I should also add that my parents are both doctors. I've spoken to both of them about my mental health. Dad did not even flinch, he kept scrolling his Facebook and completely ignored. Mom said ""You're selfish for thinking you're the only one"" and mocked me for my suicidal attempts. I do acknowledge they have their own issues and try my best to offer moral support. When confronting my mom, she'd say she's done everything to put me and my siblings in the best of schools and a roof above our heads. I agree, without the financial support of my parents, my sisters and I would be nowhere. 

I've battled with anxiety and depression besides an autoimmune disorder and chronic fatigue. Most days, even to just brush and wash my face is a huge task but I have no option. All my energy is wasted on house chores and I have no energy left for my academic work. I have assignments that are overdue since 2 months and cannot being myself to work on them.

Mom is aware of my autoimmune disorder and provides meds but the side effects wear me out. She knows this but calls me lazy for not being able to get out of bed. Have taken the matter with sisters but they're far from empaths and live in their own bubble. Whenever I share my feelings, all they do is text on their phones and give little responses. Perhaps they're still young to understand me.

Due to such factors, I've almost failed numerous classes. Having a friend who is constantly competing w me doesn't help. Won't share readings when I'm sick, has deliberately chosen a professor I had applied to for my thesis, deleted assignments on my laptop when we were sharing a room and I was away, dk how she even knew my password, has threatened me by taking away my kitchen knife without permission and posting it on social media, etc. Boyfriend is extremely ambitious and self-centered.

I have a dream of working in publishing and magazines but since I'm the eldest, I am crippled with responsibilities and my parents expect me to work a safe job and contribute financially from my first paycheck. While most of my friends are having fun at parties and dining out, I am stuck at home tending to everyone's needs.

Everything I used to enjoy and my hobbies I have deserted, finding no energy. Every night I cry myself to sleep thinking of myself as the biggest failure.  I understand I still am extremely privileged than a lot of people and I must count my blessings. But I'm scared to be stuck in this loop forever.

I'm sorry for the scattered post. I had no one to talk to. If there's anyone out there feeling and going thru the same thing,  I send you my love and prayer. I do my best to take it one day at a time. 

I've managed to hide away a mere 70 dollars from my scholarship, that I'd saved up for the past year. Hoping to start a very low budgeted online shop this year. Wish me luck."

depression,Im kinda scared that i might commit suicide,"I'm not depressed anymore (I think) but I still kinda have suicidal moments. Like right now I'm not suicidal but I become suicidal sometimes.

I'm scared that one day I'll go on a balconey or bridge and just kill myself. I hate that. I don't want to die but I do. 

My first instinct when I feel bad (embarrassed, upset, betrayed) is to self harm. I haven't cut myself for like 8-9 months but I still scratch and dig my nails into myself. It makes me so mad at myself that I can't just stop being like that. I don't want to self harm

I don't really know what to do about it but I felt like telling someone."

depression,I might lose the love of my life,"Hello, here is the thing: my boyfriend is currently in a deep depression (+severe anxiety) that leads him to be unable to do most of the things and almost killing himself. I don’t know what to do anymore. 
(Sorry for the writing, English is not my native language)

He was diagnosed with high IQ and ADHD when he was little and took a medicine (aka Ritaline) who made him depressed. He went often to the hospital to see psychiatrists and psychologists to « fight » his ADHD and became depressed after when he was a teen. He is 22 now, like me, so he struggled with depression for the past 7-8 years or so.

It was not so complicated in the beginning for me since we didn’t lived together but now it’s really hard. (We are together since we were 17yo, so it’s been 5years and we’ve moved out together since 5month)
It’s hard to see him sad and stressed. I just went through severe depression myself the past few month and for the moment I’m okey but I see I can go back to this illness if I don’t take care of myself.

He is sometimes unable to get up when I need him, have panic attacks and sometimes even paralysis. He had to take 2weeks at home last time because he couldn’t go to work anymore.

We both agreed that he paid the rent of the appartement when we moved together, since I have to finish my studies (more than 33hours a week of lessons, and even a side job wouldn’t cover all the rent)
He is also a student but part time job as a apprenticeship.

He is ending his contract with his job since he can’t deal with this toxic environment (they didn’t really liked the fact he has depression) and I understand but he needs to work in another place or we basically will have to leave our home in a couple of month, which will be really difficult.
I have help from allowances and my parents but it won’t pay everything, even if i have a side job.

So now I almost have to do everything like finding him a job, cleaning the house and cooking, help him to calm his panic attacks and just be here for him when I don’t have the strength to do all of this myself. I love him but I feel i’m « falling » with him.
He wants to do more and apologises often that he can’t help me, and I believe he would if he wasn’t depressed.

But I just don’t know how to behave anymore, I don’t know if I can stay with him even if I really love him."
depression,I hate this,[removed]
depression,For those thinking of self harm,"I am currently like you flummoxed and confused by everything.  I have lost everything I knew in the last six months (my wife, my house, my car, my job - I know, sounds like a shitty country music song already) and I am lost, just like you.  There seems to be many of us in here who are constantly waking up to thoughts of suicidal ideation, self harm, a barrage of depressed feelings and feelings of dread for what the future holds.  I am curious to ask everyone feeling this, are you feeling this way because the world feels like it is stuck and not moving?  Can anyone relate to this?

I have been thinking of the things in life that I am grateful for, but it only goes so far.  I feel as if half the world is contemplating ending it because it does not seem like it is getting better.  Does not matter what is happening, everything feels funky and desperate.  I run through the motions of how and where, when I should be thinking of bettering myself and improving.  But how can one better oneself when they hate themselves so much?  Constantly thinking what’s the point, why are we here, can I get a sign or an epiphany that shows me the way?  

It is all too much and I would love to chat with some individuals who are feeling the same way - I want to improve, I want to be different “this time around” but I have zero energy to do so.  Sure, I have spurts where I am trying to do new things, challenge myself like I haven’t before (in small ways, big things would be too much right now) but it seems fleeting.  The world feels so lonely and down, are we all changing for something better on the horizon?  Is there a new Age upon us?  Again, just a rant for this Sunday morning as everything seems like it is falling apart."
depression,Anyone down for sleep accountability?,[removed]
depression,How I will be happy,"I have maladaptive daydreaming for as long as I can remember, at the very least six years doing it every single day. I have virtually no hobbies other than consuming media to fuel my daydreams. I feel completely detached to this reality, this body I am in and my family. I don't love them and I can't recognise myself in the mirror anymore. I hate my identity and anything it implies. This isn't me. I've tried subliminals for a while and gotten some results but recently I have found out about shifting/respawning. I have my ideal world and ideal me planned out perfectly and I need to be there. I need to go home and sever ties with this fake reality. I cannot live with myself and this face and this body and this past anymore, it disgusts me and I don't want a life like this. I don't have a particularly tragic life, I just hate anything to do with it. Whenever I see my name on documents I feel sick, whenever somebody takes a photo of me I feel repulsed. If anybody looks at me I wish I could just die on the spot. If I must be trapped in this reality forever I will choose to kill myself in the hopes that I can transfer my consciousness to the right place. If my attempts at respawning keep failing that is what I will do. I've scripted that I will have a heart attack and respawn, but if this does not happen with the subliminals I have also scripted that if I die/commit suicide I will wake up in my desired reality. There is no future for me here. I am a disappoint to myself. I am meant to have a different face, different body, different ancestry, different family, different home, different name, different life story and so on. I need my daydreams to be real because they are the only thing that used to make me happy, but now even they make me sad because I want to feel them. Even as a child I would daydream for hours and a lot of them were of a disturbing nature (maybe skip this part if you don't want to read that) a lot of them feature me being kidnapped and raped by an obsessive stalker who loves me, and is dangerous and he kills people for his own pleasure (I am highly attracted to this concept) in my desired reality I was molested as a child for character development (yeah I know how it sounds) i dream about committing murder and getting on the front pages with my new and beautiful face on display. I dream about getting pregnant but miscarrying because the plot line demands it. I also dream about being infamous as the lover of a serial killer or otherwise violent male criminal. There is more but I will leave it out. Anyway I don't know what's wrong with me but there is probably is something haha. This has been going on since I was probably nine years of age or ten maybe. At first I didn't want my dreams to be real but now all I want is that. I listen to any catchy music and pace for hours until my legs hurt and my head too. Everyday I wake up in this reality I feel like crying. I stay awake for hours on end repeating affirmations in my mind until I simply get too tired and my body aches so I roll over and sleep while daydreaming some more. I don't know what to do anymore. This is my only hope."
depression,"Keeping your depression to yourself, as to not be a burden onto others...","Do you ever feel like you have to downplay your depression when you are around close friends or loved ones, because you worry that having to hear about it will only annoy those people? 

I should clarify that my own depression isn't nearly as bad as the more serious cases. I've been seeing a therapist, sporadically for at least three years and I have tried medication to various yet ultimately unimpactful ends, but I am able to at least function. I can hold a job, I can get out of bed and shower, I am in a committed relationship, etc.

However, I once again find myself feeling like I can't really discuss some of the darker and more sobering thoughts I'm having with my fiancée or even with my therapist, because I feel like it's all just noise. Self-involved oblivious complaining, when others have it so much worse.

Even now, as I type out this anonymous post, I feel like I have no business talking about how bad I feel when there are people who have so much less than I do. I don't want to get too political (for lack of a better word) but I am a straight white American male. I have plenty of privilege that others don't. 

That doesn't mean I don't still have problems, whether they are external or internal, it's just that I know I could be much worse off. A lot of my problems could be seen as self-imposed, and that's kinda why I feel like I shouldn't even bother talking about them.

Our culture has a tendency to take a more prideful approach to everything. All that talk of working hard, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, and so on. Stop complaining and do something to change your situation. No one wants to hear about it. No one wants to talk about it. We're all probably dealing with something, but we force ourselves to do so alone. Asking for help is seen as a sign of weakness. 

Don't get me started on the problematic implications that religion brings to the situation, just know that I am more likely to tell you to go fuck yourself, than take you seriously if you suggest I turn to god for help. That's just more platitudinous bullshit people throw around, rather than actually putting forth any effort to help. Thoughts and prayers, my ass.

But that's just another layer in why I tend to keep my problems to myself. I either am ignored; written off as an emotionally immature child, or given ineffective bandaids that do nothing for me; it just makes the other person feel better about themselves. 

So yeah, I'm in my early 40s, I'm engaged, and financially stable. My physical health isn't ideal, but it's far from concerning. I have a family that is close enough, but not without the usual levels of infighting. I shouldn't have anything to be depressed about. At least that is how I have been conditioned to think.

Meanwhile, I feel unfulfilled in my personal life when it comes to my career, or lack thereof. I have no passion for anything, so I just keep going from one dead end job after another. I spend all day feeling like I am capable of more, I just have no direction or motivation to find something better. I feel empty when on the clock and rudderless when off. 

My relationship status is better than I could have ever hoped for, especially after a previous failed marriage and a lack of experience in general. Still, I worry I am going to screw it up. If that happens, I really don't see myself ever dating again. 

I don't know what more else to say, but this is definitely one of those days when I feel completely isolated and embarrassed at myself for being so selfish when others have nothing."
depression,my best friend is pushing me away and i don’t know what to do,"(big rant) 
these last three years have not been great but me and my best friend have been able to stay together for a really long time and it was sorta the only thing to keep me going. that was until… a couple weeks ago. she lashed out on my friends not inviting me and her which definitely was the beginning of the end for us. ever since that day i don’t hear anything from her until i see her at school, and she almost looks sick of me when i try to speak. she’s becoming more quiet and only rlly posts on her private stories (try dming her from there, nothing.) 

i’ve had covid so i haven’t been at school and it really hurts that i can’t talk to my friend anymore… i asked for the homework, asked her how her day was. it’s like i don’t even exist to her anymore. i think she’s spiralling again and i’m scared because i can’t seem to get in contact with her. what should i do to be a good friend in this situation? do i give her space or keep trying to get her to talk

tldr - my friend is trying to isolate herself and i don’t know what i can do as a friend to help her since i have covid"

I'll try to do it right, spend a month on DD, and then pull the trigger.  Either I become rich or I'll have an excuse to end it all when my calls expire worthless.  I suppose in a way I got bored of gambling with money and now I'm putting my life on the line too.

depression,"Still going strong, at least for now","Tl;dr traumatic childhood, shit luck in life


Backstory: I had a very abusive childhood, dad went to prison and mom was going guy to guy and I only remember one that was actually a good guy. I moved in with my grandma who was sick and was on oxygen. For over a year I took care of her before I went to school and after her hospice nurse left at night. I woke up one morning and found her, afterwards I had to move back in with my mom.
Her current boyfriend was on meth and extremely abusive to both of us. I had a fold out bed in the garage with a little desk and a computer that I would play games on to escape. I woke up countless nights to them fighting about sex and cheating and whatever else he could come up with. Me and my mom would pack up and leave and sleep in her car until she brought me to school the next day. We always ended up going back, he broke her arm and I got my ass kicked. She stayed with him.
One week I went camping with a friends family and when I came back they had both disappeared and nobody had seen either of them since I left.
I got put into foster care and eventually found out my mom moved 1500 miles away, I didn’t talk to her for 10 years.

So I have had issues with drugs and alcohol since I was like 13/14. Got expelled from multiple schools and ended up in a continuation school that probably saved my life at that point. That’s where I met my now wife. Once I graduated I started doing better with my depression, life was good, I was working a good job, driving a nice car, beautiful girlfriend… etc… the whole time I was kinda jealous that she had a family that loves her and I don’t, still feel that way.

Jump forward 8ish years. I’m clean except for a couple beers a week, We’re engaged, first baby on the way. I lose my job because the new owner wanted a whole new staff to pay them less. I find a new job that I hate but pays the bills and end up drinking more and more. Baby was born. Our home burned down and all we got out were us and the pets, also we just changed out insurance and it didn’t kick in for that yet so it was a total write off. Then my dog died. Then we moved out of the area and my wife could transfer but I couldn’t so I was out of a job and she was working full time while I watched the baby.

I’m at a point where I feel useless, I don’t feel fit to be a father. I’ve dealt with depression my whole life and this is getting worse than it’s ever been. If it weren’t for my little princess I probably wouldn’t be here at this point. I know I need to be here for her, so she doesn’t deal with what I had to.

I have no family other than hers and my baby that’s too young to understand that daddy’s hurting thankfully, I have no friends because of moving. So I can’t just open up and vent to anybody"

According to my mum and her boyfriend she never leaves her bedroom, she is constantly avoiding her own boyfriend (moving to a different area of the house from him every time he sits with her), she’s randomly nasty at times and doesn’t want to do anything. Shes even been faking illness so she doesn’t have to come places. She talks on this chat room for grieving people since her dog died. All she does is talk to these depressed people online. All day, all night, at work, at home. Like she’s addicted to this chat room and it seems like all these people do is keep her in this depressive state (it’s the same ppl she talks to, she has friends on there). Also her dog died a year ago and she’s obsessively upset about it. She’s just as upset as the day he did died one year on and to me it just doesn’t make sense? Her dog was her baby but he was getting old and she’d always casually be mentioning “ah well when he dies we’ll-“ “well he’ll probably pop his clogs soon and then-“ but now he’s gone she cries every time he’s brought up. A year on. Every single conversation is about him as well. I’m not denying her grief but it’s very out of character for her and so unexpected. I’ve even heard that she’s been more upset about the dog dying than when her own mother died. idk. Either way she definitely needs help but none of us know how to go about this.

Her sister has been on the phone to us asking us for help, her boyfriend as well. What can we do?"
depression,Just thinking.,"I want to end my life, but I don’t because of my boyfriend. I don’t know if I should just break up with him or wait for him to leave then I can still do it if I’m struggling still. I just don’t want to struggle for nothing. I feel like it’s never going to be better. Hopeless sucks."
depression,Made a list,"I sat down tonight, to make a list of the symptoms that I'm experiencing in preparation for my first counseling session tomorrow. 
I've never done it before, so I'm not sure what to expect. Anyway, I'm two handwritten pages into this list and I feel so crazy. 
I really have two full pages (and counting) of ways that my mental illness debilitates my life, and that's on meds.
I feel so lost.  
I can't believe I've been living this way. Asking my family to love with me when I'm this way.

depression,I’m lonely but I shut ppl out,"The most frustrating feeling is staring at my screen four hours everyday, wanting to reach out, thinking of someone I miss and love and do nothing but stare at our conversation until the sun goes down. It’s so lonely to immediately think of the same person when you’re happy, sad, bored, whatever and the moment you have their attention, words stop coming out. It’s even more frustrating to constantly need validation then when you receive it, it goes in one ear out the other. I always think I’m fine but when I break down over the smallest thing I can’t stop crying. I hate that everybody in my life has expectations for me that go in opposite directions and I’m the only one who’s stressed out because I don’t wanna lose them. I hate that everyday is a cycle and even when I start to change I fall back to laying all day, doing nothing, thinking nothing, as if I’m a potato. I hate laughing at everything to pretend I’m happy. I hate that if I died no one would care. Okay that’s all"
depression,It’s sad when the only day you go outside is when you see groups of people with their friends and then you come home and want to die,"Today is Canada day, and I went out at night with my sister to the beach *we hardly go outside or do anything outside at all, we have no friends*
So we decided to check out the beach at 10pm, we go and it’a filled with people hanging out in groups with friends and such, or significant others.
I feel worse than when I did before I went out tonight, I feel worse lol.

depression,I can’t stop thinking about killing myself.,"I have been begging people for help. My entire family has died in the last five months and I have no one. Everyone at my work is quitting it being fired, and I’m convinced I’m going to be fired soon. And my job is so stressful I think about killing myself every second I’m there. I just want to die. I’m completely alone and useless. I want to rot into the ground. Climb a mountain and dissolve into the elements. I have nothing left. I am a miser and a nihilist. I should die."
depression,Do I have depression?,"Figured I would check with this sub because I don’t want to bring this up with friends or family. 

I feel tired. Like everything sounds exhausting to do. I procrastinate as much as possible at work and doing home chores/tasks because it all seems pointless. What is the point of just working every single day, doing the same thing every. single. day. Always people in charge that do things backwards in terms of progress. It’s gotten to the point where I hide the amount of work I’ve automated because I’m tired of getting more work assigned. No promotion or advancement in sight so why bother. 

In my free time I play video games to delay things I should be doing. It’s not even fun, just whatever it takes to avoid doing that other thing. 

I’m not happy. I don’t remember just being at peace within the last year. There is always something to stress about. Whether its finances, or family deaths, or upcoming obligations, there is always some lingering problem to deal with. 

I would never kill myself, but I also wouldn’t mind just not being alive I guess. Like if I didn’t wake up, I don’t think Id be pissed about it. 

Idk, I just wanna feel happy."
depression,I don't know what to do.,"So I'm having a rough time lately and thought if I ended everything it would benefit everyone involved. I miss my Dad and want to see him (he passed in March), my boyfriend is losing patience with my depression. I can't seem to get the motivation to do anything than head to work and get something to eat. There's more, but I can't remember at the moment.

So I've never self-harmed before. I don't know what happened, or why, and I hoped it was a bad dream. I took an x-acto knife and started cutting.

I wanted to, but I also feel like I didn't. I was hoping to hit a decently sized vein, and that my blood was thin enough (I'd taken ibuprofen for a headache) to just kinda work. 

I missed the major veins. Part of it was likely on purpose. I think. 

So I'm panicking and don't know what to do. They're too obvious and chaotic to explain as something else. I haven't told anyone and am worried someone might notice. I have them covered with large bandaids and am changing them frequently and applying Neosporin hoping to avoid scarring. 

So, I guess. Where do I go from here? What if someone finds out? How do I hide them? 

Thanks."

depression,Idk what to do anymore,"I know I'm young and I have a lot to live for and things get better blah blah blah I've heard it a thousand times. But I'm stuck at a job I hate, likely going to get fired at this rate, thousands in debt, deep in depression, and lacking anyone I'm close to besides family. 

People know about my mental problems but they don't understand just how bad they are. Every day when I drive to work the only reason I don't drive into oncoming traffic is putting others at risk. The only reason I don't slit my wrists or shoot myself is the mess and the chance my little sister would find me.

I don't want to live. All I want is to die at this point. If I could die and have it not inconvenience anyone I cared about then I would do it in a heartbeat.

I even had a good day yesterday. Made some bad choices but it wasn't a bad day. But tonight I feel worse than ever. It'd just be so easy at this point."

I hate how I am made to feel guilty for even considering the thought of suicide.

I just hate how I am forced to go about my daily life and have to constantly lie that I’m okay. Just to avoid shock or disappointment from others."

Well, at least I could cry; somehow, that fact just helps me."
depression,Struggling a lot with overthinking things. Need honest advise,"Probably my biggest fantasy is to not have my guard up 24/7 with everyone. Being able to open up to someone, or rely on someone.

Now there are two major problems with this. Firstly, will this ever happen? Will I ever be normal enough to let it happen? Or will I scare away everyone with my insecurities and psychological problems.
Secondly, if this does happen, is it really wise to let your guard down with anyone? The vast vast majority of people are assholes, waiting for a chance to take advantage of you, what are the odds the person I let my guard down to won't be one? Not great tbh. And why would anyone even wanna carry my mental burdens? What does anyone owe me to begin with? Why would anyone put themselves through it for me?

It seems of someone is willing to go through with it, it is unlikely they're doing it for me. Odds are they're gonna use whatever they get against me eventually.

So a major question that arises is, is it even worth it, to think about and seek companionship? Is the burden on my brain worse, or is the risk of someone taking advantage of me, and leaving me ten times as broken and insecure worse?

And that leads us to the most important question. Is any of it worth it to begin with? Is living worth it? If both the outcomes of the game end in tremendous/prolonged suffering, why play at all? Is it not the humane thing to do to just put myself out of this misery early on?

I really am looking for one good logical reason as to why ending it isn't the kindest/best thing?"

depression,"It's hard to be the eldest. At this moment, I want to end everything.","I am now currently 20, female. And for the past few months, life for me has been really hard. I was 18 when my mom died and since then, I stood as the mother of the family, because my father seems to only work and goes home to either eat, bath, or sleep. It's been so hard since I am now in college and at the same time tending to the needs of my younger siblings, the younger one is a senior high school, while the youngest in elementary.

I feel it suffocating, there are times where my father doesn't give money leading me to find ways to have some just to survive the month. I want to enjoy my younger years but it seems that I was given a heavier responsibility and I can't get away with it. Bills needed to be paid, food needed for survival, also some debts to pay. I want to work, but there are a lot of circumstances hindering me to do so. 

We only stay at our grandmother's house (my mom's mother) and don't even own one. There are times where we fight because of the financial matters. With that, for the past 2 years, those exhausted me, and the effects are quite visible now. My academic performance was affected, I became more introverted, I feel trouble sleeping and then overslept or vice versa, I don't have appetite to do anything, I only eat once or twice a day (because I am always nagged to do so), but if I am not reminded, I don't eat for the whole day.

As I am writing this, I am crying, I have no one to tell these struggles, I want to see a psychologist or seek any medical help, but I don't have money. I have quite few friends and it's just that, I just don't want to reach out to them.

depression,I don't know how to cope with this anymore,"26 y/o, suffered with depression and anxiety since uni and at this point I am coming to terms with the fact I have  pretty much ruined my life. I'm functional - I work full time, cook for myself etc but I am completely dead inside. I have no motivation to do anything except sit in bed on my phone/laptop, I'm apathetic to everything, I don't know what happiness feels like. I waste my days away in my bedroom. I have no friends because I pushed them all away. I broke up with my perfect partner of 5 years because I didn't have the mental capacity to be in a healthy relationship and felt like he deserved way better. I regret it. 

I'm completely alone and it's all my fault. 

I haven't been able to commit to therapy on multiple occasions and I'm too scared to take medication from previous bad side effects. I force myself to go to the gym and it does nothing. I eat healthy for weeks and it does absolutely nothing for me.  I don't know what to do,  I feel like I'll never be able to overcome this. It's getting worse as the years go on. 

I want to cease existing... yet I am too scared to kill myself. How pathetic. I'm doomed to live out this shitty life a complete shell of my existence and forced to deal with the bad decisions I make daily. Going on 6 years now and there's no end in sight."
depression,"I'm horrible, confidence is a bitch to get.","God, I've been trying my best to work kn my confidence. But it can never work, which makes me question if I'm truly really a man or not.

Being me (17M) is the worst, man. Being overweight, horrible voice, not athletic at all, with no necessary skills or talent, do you know how hard it is to get confidence as the way I am? I've been even trying to go to the gym or even exercise, but it's so embarrassing knowing my family even fucking teases me about it. And as many times as I asked my parents about the gym, they just usually forget it. 

It definitely doesn't help the fact I failed my current school year thanks to taking virtual classes, and now I'm most likely going to lose most of my friends, and get judged much, much more.

I wanna make myself better, but it's so hard to focus on that, as well as other things like my school is reopening soon. That's going to shorten my time so much. I dont know what to do. I hate myself. I hate being me. I can barely name anything good about myself. To be honest, sometimes I just wished I never fucking existed.

Sorry, this was a entire vent that I held in for a while. If I got aggressive or too much, sorry but I'm keeping it in. If I did, means that it kinda came from somewhere deep within."

This is fucking weird but since my therapy appointment early this week and being diagnosed with ptsd....I've felt numb.

I can't tap into any feelings. I feel immense guilt because I can't feel love or happiness for those around me. 

I get frustrated a lot because I don't know how I'm feeling???? How is that possible?? I'm opening the box in my head that says feelings and it's empty. 

I feel quite apathetic if I don't think too hard about it but I normally think too hard about it 

I keep, I think it's disassociating??, like I'm there but I'm not there. 

I'll be stood looking for something and it stops feeling like I'm there at the super market or I've stopped working or I'm working but myself isn't?? Everything almost feels distorted but I know it's not 

I think I'm mostly coming across as just more easily irritable and frustrated. I can't sleep properly, I keep getting stressed

depression,everybody i used to go to school with glowed up.,[removed]
depression,If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question!!,"If you don't want to hear the truth how I feel. Then don't ask the fucking question! 

So many people I left me in red after I have told them how I feel. Why ask the question if you didn't care about answer.! My so-called friends have turned their backs on me. And I knew them for 20 and 10yers. But that meant nothing apparently... 6 head surgeries in one year that was 5 years ago destroyed my life. I can only walk 700m 2 times a day I can't be in a large group of people. I wake up every morning feeling like shit. It literally feels like I have to climb Everest every day!! And I have people that have honestly told me to be happier. And they are the same people that complain over one year of being isolated. Try 5 fucking years!!!!! So don't tell me what to do when you are weaker! If I'm unlucky my life I destroyed forever. And that I never can manage a full-time job. 

One year after my surgery I did rehabilitation and studied up my Grades. I got top top grades and improved my condition at the same time. So I'm weak? Yeah fucking right. It took me 2,5 years to do it but I got it done! Went from walking 70m once a day to 500m 2 times a day 

Then when I wanted to try rehabilitation and University on 50% distance. I almost did one course. But I had to fight with the system at the same time. So I got a big backlash. Thank you society. So now I go in my walk and spend the rest of my time in bed. 

I will probably get a lot of hate for this but it can't be worse than being rejected 100 times. ( probably more I have lost count)

I need to talk about dating as an ish ugly and depressed man with health problems. My experiences with dating haven't been good. I have been rejected, block, and ignored more than I can remember. All I hear is what's wrong with me. It has gotten to the point that I now believe them... Anxiety and loneness are a part of my daily life. 
Something that is really provocative is when girls say “good boys don't exist” and I'm over here like “ yes we do but I was apparently too ugly and boring for you” I'm not going to lie I had 7 months when I wasn't lonely. I meet my first girlfriend and finally lost my virginity. The problem was that she was toxic. So I had to leave that relationship. But apparently, I was good for her because I was her first. And 2 months later she found a new one. So I did something right. The reason why she was bad for me was that she started a lot of fights and when she got upset she said some really horrible things just to put me down. When I broke up she said some nasty stuff. Now once did I say anything bad back. I even had other people reading it and I asked them If I did or say something wrong. And trust me dose people would tell me if I did something wrong. Even if that was difficult I don't regret anything. Now 2 years later I'm back to being rejected so a part of me thinks that I should have stayed. My therapist doesn't agree. 😂 

So why doesn't a man who never would take his partner for granted, be there for her when she needs you ( even after me breaking up yes I didn't ignore all here messages I answered even too all the really mean stuff) I will give you a few reasons. 1 I'm not “cool or macho” 2 I'm short 3 I don't look good 4 I'm not confident 5 I have health issues 6 I'm depressed. There we go I have given you some reasons 😂 you might say that you don't want a macho man. But if we look back to school growing up. Who got all the girls?  One thing for sure it wasn't me. What I have realized after talking to A LOT of people is the a lot of girls want a bad boy that they can turn good. My only hope is to find the few who just want a good boy. And yes I know that you girls exist. The only problem with you is that you 99% of the time already have found the love of your life. And to put a disclaimer out I'm not hating on girls I just tell you why I feel the way I do. And trust me I know I'm far from perfect. But I will be there for you 24/7 even if I have mad anxiety, I will never take you for granted and I will tell you regularly that you are my light in this dark tunnel and that I'm so lucky to have you. You might wonder how I am when I'm really depressed. What I probably will say is that you deserve someone better than me. The girl that can handle that is an angle. Thank you for reading my rant. I hope that you will get through whatever you are battling and I wish you the best. Damn I just realized that I haven't told you about my health issues. I already have a post about it I will link it. Thank you.

I have lived 5 years of hell so far."
depression,Expat feeling like everything is against me,"Hi guys. I hope it is okay to post here. I'm in a really tricky situation and feel like I don't have the tools and will to cope or to make the situation better.

I moved to Spain from NZ about 5 months ago. I had been thinking about moving to Europe for so many years, and a few years ago I met my Spanish partner and finally had the right excuses and conditions to go. I knew I would be supported, financially and otherwise, through the whole thing. Admittedly, moving overseas during covid from somewhere covid-free to Spain of all places was not the best idea, but I was sick of letting the virus put brakes on my life, and my partner got a good offer back home. So he moved here, set up a flat etc, and I followed 2 months later with a student visa and enough savings to survive without a job for up to a year. I was so excited, and even though I had to leave my best friend and my family, there was so much hope in my future, and so much support from my loved ones.

Fast forward nearly five months, and I really am understanding the idea of the 'black dog'. I've had bouts of depression before, but never like this. There are a few moving pieces for me:

* Firstly, a chronic illness I've been trying to get a diagnosis for for a year is flaring up big time and flattening me like a steamroller. This isn't new, just particularly bad at the moment, and I'm losing the ability to do hobbies that keep my mental health in check (piano, running, gym etc). I've been able to get a few hours worth of work a week, but I really have to keep myself in check because if I don't get 9-10 hours of sleep a night, plus a nap during the day often, I can't cope even with the small amount of work that I do have.
* Secondly, the beauracracy here is pretty horrific, and so anything from getting a visa to getting a doctor's appointment feels like walking through sludge. It feels like the  whole damn government is against me some days.
* Thirdly, the Spanish course I signed up for a paid an excessive amount of money for has been such an absolute let down. I love learning languages in general, but I lost any kind of drive within a few short weeks. I feel entirely unchallenged, one of our teachers is an asshole (i.e. bullies students, makes us feel bad for making mistakes etc), and I have tried to fix a lot of the problems for myself by pushing to move up a level and trying to ask another teacher for help with the asshole teacher, but inevitably nothing happens. For instance, I asked to move up a level, and they literally would not let me move. I asked for a level test to prove that the level I'm currently in is not challenging me, and they wouldn't even let me take it. I spend 4 hours/day in this class, and it is draining me entirely. 
* Fourthly, obviously I'm very far from home and have no way of going back. I haven't felt overly homesick too many times, and I have been keeping in touch with my best friend and my family a lot. However, I'm quite frustrated because my partner keeps mentioning things at random about how he wishes he had stayed, gotten residency, how he misses certain aspects of life in NZ that we don't get over here, etc. These comments make me a bit homesick, and some days I spiral a bit thinking about what we could do if we went back. Of course, things would have been so much easier for me if I had stayed. I wouldn't have to deal with visa crap, I would be able to speak the language easily, and if I needed to go to the doctor I just could.
* Lastly, I'm not sure. I feel like I can put my finger on some of the things making me feel like crap, but sometimes I'm just sad or angry and I don't know why. Some days I don't want to get out of bed and eat. Other days I'm fine until I get a pang of pain or get frustrated during class and the rest of the day just completely sucks.

I'm not entirely sure where I'm going with this, but I guess I just needed to vent a little bit. I spent so much time, money and energy on this move, just to arrive here and feel like the world is against me. I knew it was going to be hard, yet it's completely defeating me at the moment. And I feel like I would just be so ashamed of having to go back home, tail between my legs, and potentially losing my partner in the process if he couldn't/wouldn't come back with me."
depression,College Failure,"Warning: lengthy post lol

This past year I have been more depressed than ever. I started university and my first semester grades were not great, but I had concurrent credit that keep me afloat and away from academic probation. (Although up until just recently I thought I was on academic probation at the time bc they made me sign this really confusing form and also I'm dumb.) I was very depressed during that time but ignoring it, pretending it wasn't there &amp; hoping it would just go away on its own. Spring semester rolled around, and every single course I enrolled in ended up being online. I was like, okay, this is fine. It was a new semester. I could adapt to it, right? Unfortunately, I could not. I really did try for the first few weeks, but my depression got the best of me. All this work being online, with no tangible difference between school &amp; break (we also did not have a spring break which was around when things started to get really bad for me), no sense of schedule, and my absolute lack of motivation made attempting to succeed a horrendous failure for me. I was finding it hard to function and eventually just stopped doing anything school related. I lost contact with everyone. I was so sure that I was just going to fail out of college regardless. I was intent on killing myself because I couldn't deal with all of the stress and depression. End of the semester rolled around, and I ended up failing every class. To my surprise, I didn't get kicked out of university (like I said, I'm dumb and thought I was already on probation). Instead, I've now been placed on academic probation. However, I also apparently lost my financial aid, which is as good as getting kicked out to me. I didn't know this until recently, and I feel terrible. I feel bad for making my parents lose money. A few weeks ago they asked to see my grades and I forged them a bit because I was afraid they would kick me out or something if they knew the truth. They think my GPA is 2 point something, but it's really much lower. I can't appeal the school for financial aid because I would need a note from a counselor or someone along those lines. I can't really afford a counselor in the first place, and I've never seen any kind of psychiatrist so I have also never been diagnosed with depression. My parents just recently found out that my student loans were returned so they're going to have to pay that back. They got upset and they don't understand why since I wasn't honest about what my actual grades were. All F's is an unofficial withdrawal which means I lose my student loans. I need to confess and tell them but I don't know how. I'm at a loss as to what to do. I want to die but I don't have a good way of killing myself. I felt like my depression was just starting to get a tiny bit better, as I had planned to maybe transfer down to a community college and figure things out from there. But now I have to fix this financial situation and I feel terrible for being such a burden on my parents. I'm ridden with anxiety and I don't know how to tell them that I lied and that I was actually doing much worse academically. I wish I could go back and change the past.

I didn't mean to make this post so long, but I'm just trying to get my feelings down. I wish I could talk to a friend but I'd ghosted all of them. If anyone has any advice or just anything to say in general, it would be greatly appreciated."
depression,(Rant) Being stuck,"I started a new job, I was only there for a day and half cause I panicked about this being my life, the same job that I've worked before over and over since highschool and I keep asking if this is it. Am I just going to keep doing the same thing, talk about what you did over the weekend over and over again. 

I asked for help and they referred me to do online courses (CBT) which I am doing but it's basic things to do if you just Google depression and how to deal with it. Everytime I do a course again the question of is this it? Am I just not going to be helped? runs through my mind and that just puts me even deeper into a depressed state.

I'm just writing this to try clear my mind of something, of what I don't think I'll ever know."
depression,I was doing so well and I think I’m back to square one- so much has happened,"I think I need to explain everything before I can fully express how empty I feel right now. 

Not that long I meet a guy, that I’ve already previously talked about before, who knew he would have such a significant impact on me when everything was short lived. 

Anyways I meet him in a rough time and I think I used him as a distraction to the chaos of emotions that I felt. Now this is already bad I know but to make it even worse he wasn’t the best. He would purposely try to make me feel/look stupid and at one point told me that I “lacked common sense” all to which I would brush off. And thats not the problem because these things that he would do towards me really wouldn’t affect me. I knew that his opinion of me was of little value. So why even go back? Well I think my problem is that I’ve never truly felt loved by someone and although he verbally sucked he offered comfort in the forms of physical touch. I’m not naive or stupid I knew that to him I was seen as someone dumb but usable. This was later proven true when he randomly stopped texting me which again didn’t hurt. 

What did hurt was the fact that in that short amount of time I became dependent on the physical touch that made me feel not so empty and sad. So when that stopped I truly felt devastated. Which is a weird thing might I add, crying not for a person but what that person could provide. 

But let me further explain, he didn’t know that I’m dealing with depression and that whenever it came to us cuddling and him kissing me it felt like I was whole. It made me forget everything because this was something that I never experienced and found out I loved. My mom /family was never the one to show affection especially if it was physical. I couldn’t tell you of a time that I hugged or that my mother hugged me, she also was never the one to verbally demonstrate affection. So when I started to feel affection it became really emotional for me. I never knew how much I needed that/ was deprived of. 

Funny because I’ve always dealt with my depression alone and although he never knew it those few days that we were together i didn’t feel so lonely. 

Anyways the aftermath of that was even worse than I had originally been in. I felt alone and empty and like the whole weight of my sadness was back on me. I spent it the first few days trying to convince myself that I was fine before I gave in and fully allowed myself to feel sad. The sadness lasted a while and for a minute I thought that was my breaking point. But one day I got up and told myself I no longer wanted to deal with my depression and for some reason I began to feel better, there was a couple of things that I knew would trigger me and I purposely avoided them. 

Yet for some reason today I began to go through the whole motions of feeling alone and it came back really hard. At this point it hurts to open up to others so I don’t know what to do."

depression,Counselling recommended!,"I had my first counselling session yesterday. I was weirdly calm, considering I had a big panic attack when going to the doctors the day before! I think it was because I knew counselling is what I need and that it will help me. 

It went really well, we actually have a lot in common! She asked me what I wanted when the sessions ended- I said I wanted to feel that I wasn’t crazy and also a letter that says I’m sane like they do on all the films. 

I cried on her-lots!

I laughed with her- a bit. 

I realised I was probably born in the wrong era-most of my morals are from the 1930s, like keeping private life on the down low (no arguments outside, that kind of thing)

I told her most things (we couldn’t cover all the bases as I had already gone over my time by half hour!) I had a major headache all day afterwards but she said that may happen. I also slept like a baby, something that hasn’t happen for AGES! 

I still don’t feel ready for work and I doubt I’ll feel ready for a while yet, but at the moment, I don’t even care! 

She said we have a lot to work on but she knows I can do it with her help. 

I feel this is the beginning of an end… but then I’m having a good day today so I’ll probably feel like shit tomorrow and wonder why on Earth I’m doing all this! 

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to write down some positive things to remind me for when I have those bad days."
depression,how to feel?,"i just wonder how people can process emotions at this point. i feel like i have a heck of a lot of emotional baggage to go through at the moment but for the life of me, i’m unable to express and process. 
i wish i could cry but it seems like i’ve become physically incapable. i started rationalizing every emotion i feel just so i don’t overreact or react over it,, i feel like i have learned so much toxic traits that i inflict on myself because i am so terrified of hurting people as a result of my suffering. 
it makes me more depressed but not particularly sad.

depression,Back in a hole.,"Here I am again, with my depression getting a hold of me and it really drives me fucking insane, nobody has to read this because it's more for me to vent I guess.

From the moment I wake up all the way till I go to sleep I just feel fucking numb, If I have time on my hands and I'm doing something that I usually enjoy doing I notice that I actually don't want to do it, I don't want to do anything. 

I always want to die but is that really any better than this place ? Is there some kind of alternate universe where shit is just... Better ? 

But then if I don't want to do anything then would I even enjoy it if life was the way I want it to be ? Maybe for a short period until the dark monster comes back and fucks that up too.

Man, what I would give to not of been caught by this fucking disease that haunts me every second of every fucking day and to add on to that I'm not only in pain mentally but also physically 24/7. 

Why do I deserve to be in pain inside and out I don't get it, if there's a reason just give me a fucking sign, give me something."

depression,I'm scared about college.,"I was just thinking about my time in high school and I feel kinda ashamed by how I handled it. I did terribly in classes and did not know how to improve in them. My social skills were and are bad. I wasn’t really committed to extracurriculars. I just feel scared that in college, I'll just mess things up just as I did in high school. I feel like I'm meant to be a failure and I'm not meant to achieve anything. I'm just scared especially when I hear stories about how professors fail like half the class. Idk why I like just stressing myself out. It's not even like I'm trying to come up with a solution to deal with these hurdles. I mean, I did write up study strategies and academic resources a few days ago. But now, I'm just choosing to stay up at night worrying about the future. I guess I like feeling like I can never become a better person because I won't expect anything from myself. But at the same time, I know my mindset is just unhealthy. It's like I always want to find some problem in my life and stress over it.

I even remember last time, when I went to some summer program at a college, I wasn’t able to make friends. I felt even ashamed of going to the cafeteria to eat alone, so I tried to stay in my room as much as possible.  

\--

I know my mindset is the problem, but I don’t know how to ""snap out of it"" sometimes. 

I stress and stress. But I don’t do the most obvious of things : Sleep at the right time, don't worry about things you can't change, go eat food at the cafeteria, meet people, etc.

I'm scared I might do the same stupid things when I go to college.

I need advice. How did you prepare for college when having depression?

Do you have a binder for thought patterns or did you do daily self-check-ins? Do you regularly mood-log to identify cognitive distortions? What has helped the most?"
depression,I think I’m gonna end things,The one thing that brought me joy seems to be gone and I’ve just had to deal with way too much over the years. I keep being told to be grateful of things but how can you be grateful for something you don’t fucking want? There’s nothing I look forward to and even getting out of bed is hard these days. I’ve got an exam next week I’m probably gonna flunk as well as I just haven’t had the motivation to study. I’m over this all honestly. Are there any things I should get in order? 20 so I don’t own a car or house or whatever but is there anything I should do?
depression,"Ex-BF Cheated, admitted to hurting me purposefully throughout the relationship and overall neglected me","I'm not sure if breakup stories are allowed but im just at my wits end and I don't know where else to post this.

He knew that even before this relationship I had extremely low self esteem, harmed myself multiple times and was about to be sent to a psych ward. He said he would take care of me, love me forever and never hurt me again like the ones before did. 

After a few months of having a wonderful relationship it started, he cheated on me, noticed that I forgave him and thought ""oh wow i can do everything and she would forgive me"" (thats his own words) from then on he wouldn't even care about hurting me anymore in anyway. I moved in about 3 years later, still affected by him cheating on me but very very slowly getting better but then even though we lived together he started ignoring me, preferred playing with his friends over doing ANYTHING with me and more stuff that just hurts too much to write.

And when I then finally got the courage to break-up because it all just made me feel worse he dared to say that my love for him was never the ""same"" as his love for me, that I lied about loving him forever and that every future relationship I had would be like cheating on him. He tried to make me come back to him by threatening me with suicide the night I broke up.

And the worst part? He already moved on, forgetting about me while I'm being plagued by him in my thoughts at night. Everytime I think about him my chest starts hurting and I can barely breath and he's already out there flirting with everything that breathes, I hate this life so much."

But I feel like that opportunity is gone now, I've been lazy and depressed for the past 4 years. I'm leaving university and entering the world with no life skills and an education which isn't worth the det as it can't secure me a job. I've wasted my younger years and I just feel like there's no way out of this.

I feel like I have nothing to work hard for. I honestly don't care much about myself and I know I'll never amount to anything because I'm lazy. I know life isn't about achieving or materialistic things like money or expensive things. Life is about experiencing the present moment and creating your own purpose, but I've never had a purpose or dream.

I don't want to just live a life where I'm working a dead end job, so the answer is to obviously do something with myself and change that rightm? But for some reason I just don't have the motivation, day in and day out I tell myself how I could improve my life and be happier. Even in this moment I could go practice skills or do some voluntary work, help the homeless, I could work out, I could do fucking loads. Yet despite knowing this I'm just filled with anger and resentment against myself and life.

I'm even greatful for the things I have, I recognise the worth of life and beauty of nature. Yet still, for almost no reason at all I still want to sit in bed all day and fantasise about killing myself one day to finally be over with this confusing experience we call life. I just don't have any effort anymore so I feel like if I'm not ever going to do anything to fix myself then I might as well kill myself. It's rediculous I know how crazy I sound, I ligit have zero reason to be like this and yet I am."
depression,A pain so deep it bellows.,"Just trying to keep my shit together. I never vent out to anybody, and any tips on how to cope with this is much appreciated. it 

                        The fact that she left me for someone else hurts, but it hurts more that she shows absolutely no remorse for her actions. Not an ounce of heat in that corrupted, blackened heart. Sitting here struggling to breathe from Covid while she is with abother man, as if nothing happened. The crying makes it even harder to breathe and trying to hold that shit in is pure chaos. I woke up this morning in pure rage, chest pains and everything, took my Nintendo Switch and snapped it right in half. I keep blocking and unblocking her number in the hopes that she'll at least check on my health, but nothing. I try with all my might to refrain from sending her long, elaborate messages on how much of a cunt she is, but I've failed at that, too. I've said some things to her that I'd never thought I'd say to anybody. When someone hurts me, I turn away and never come back, but in this instance I just lost my shit. Even when I block her number, I still have the option of checking blocked messages and I'm tempted to just snap my phone in half. Fuck, man. When she told me she found someone else, I felt something physically snap inside of me. One night she was feeling suicidal and having bad thoughts, and I didn't sleep for a week just to make sure she was okay. Everytime she called herself a loser I would go through great lenghts to prove her wrong, or everytime she was nervous for job interviews, I'd be right there. I would purposely lose at video games when we played together just to make her feel proud and happy. I never vent and I'm always trying to help other people, but maybe that's my problem...always putting other people before me. I wish I had seen this coming. I may have to go to a hospital to be put on a ventilator, and she gives no fucks. Nothing but images in my head of her and her newly found bait. 

Hope everyone is doing their best, I appreciate anybody who reads this. Just trying to hold my shit together right now and not die from Covid. Sorry for the ranting, friends. Here's to another day. 😓😓😓"

A couple of days ago I went to a business exhibition. The exhibition sent a girl to help us. These girls were from a modeling agency.  On the first days of the exhibition, one of my colleagues told me that the model girl asking about me. My colleague told her I am about to get married. Throughout the expo, I get close to her. On the last day of the expo, she asked for my number. She told me “you can give me your number if your girlfriend is not gonna be mad about it”

And I politely turn her down. But I feel terrible and limited because she was a model and easy-going, Beautiful girl. I turn her down because i am in a relationship actually i wanted to hang out with her.

depression,I don't know what to do when I'm alone,"Hi everyone,
Since a year or so, my depressed feelings have become worse and it's hard to deal with. Today I called my doctor for an appointment with a psychologist, to talk about my feelings and stuff I'm struggling with.
Anyways, right now the heavy blanket of depression makes me unable to, let's put it this way, ""think for myself"". I always need distraction from other people. When I'm alone I either lay in bed and cry or just stare at the wall. I just don't know what activities I can do, I always feel way too tired to do anything. Sometimes even brushing my teeth tires me. 
Has anyone some tips?"
depression,Snap back to panic attacks,"Yesterday I had my first panic attack after a year and since, suicidal thoughts have started to roll back in. The thought of relapsing back into that hellish depressive state I was in for 4 years before I started taking medication is so fuckin scary. 
 I've always wanted to be an author and I've already written one book, but can't continue no more due to depression.
Yesterday I went to a bookstore with my girlfriend and the thought of me not ever being able to publish my shit struck me like a truck. Looking at all of those books, at all of the creative minds behind them, I got jealous, then mad, and then finally accepted my defeat. I realized that nah I'm never gonna see my book on the book shelves because I'm too tired to go on, because I can't even write one more sentence for the life of me.
 ""I'm just a could've been should've been never was never ever will be"" played in my head as I gradually found it harder to breathe. And there it was,  the thing I thought I had finally gotten rid of, clutching its way back into my life once again, telling me I'm alive bitch. My breaths became quicker and quicker, louder and louder. Gasping for air. I wanted to drop to the floor of the crowded bookstore and start crying, wailing, screaming like I should've, but by some miracle I held it back, which in return caused me to get a killing headache. My girlfriend came to my rescue, snapped me back to reality. My knees were weak I wanted to faint. 
I think my depression is coming back, can barely get out of my bed, let alone continue working. I'm an English teacher and that requires a lot of energy. I don't think I've ever been more scared in my life"

depression,I’m getting depressed again,I’ve been doing fine for a while but this past week and a half has been so fucking brutal to me. I have no motivation to do anything and I’m just sad. It could be the fact that I don’t really have any friends at the age of 15 or something else. I haven’t had no one to talk to because everyone that used to help me doesn’t talk to me anymore. Another thing that might be bothering me is how much I get shamed by my online friends for being a virgin. We’ve known each other for a long time and we always go at each other but it’s starting to get to me. Ik that’s something I shouldn’t really care about but it’s hard not to when everyone around isn’t. And the fact that people are posting pictures of them and their friends is hurting me too because I’m not doing that. I’m just some fucking nobody that no one would care about if they just disappeared. I’m awkward and weird and everybody in my high school probably doesn’t even want to try to talk to me because of how quiet I am. I just don’t want to feel alone anymore.

I keep this my secret from everyone because I am paranoid that they would belittle me or feel sorry for me. It wouldn't make things any better.

I can't enjoy anything, i moved to another country and I can't make any friends because of anxiety, i can't find a purpose or something to live for, even tho I have a child (I'm separated from my gf tho, and they are in another country).

Nobody never understood my pain, i have nobody to speak openly with, i was always trying to pretend to be a *though guy*, but i can't take it no more.
I don't want to fall again, and its not because I want it, i don't like drugs but i think it's because of depression and the fact that I can't find a purpose, something worth living/doing.
I thought about ending my life since I was only i child and now I have this thoughts again i can't take no more. I need some love, someone to trust me, some hope.

I was actually quite concerned so I called her mother to ask her how's she doing and she said that is a depressive episode again and that she doesn't get out of bed at all. And since it's summer session now, she doesn't study for exams and fails and that also makes it even harder for her. 

As a matter of fact, she had those before, those types of depressive episodes, where she will isolate herself from the whole world and then she will appear out of nowhere and will be completely fine. Those episodes last for about a week or two, max. three weeks. 

I'm just worried that she may do something to harm herself, last time we talked over the phone was a week and a half ago and she was having a panic attack and I managed to calm her down but that's about it.

I advised her to go to my psychiatrist together so that she can get help or go to some therapy, but she declined. 

I just don't know how to approach her since what worked for me as to get my mental health better doesn't work for her and from what I see, she doesn't want help and that makes me really concerned.

I would really appreciate some advice on what to do, because for the first time in my life I am at loss (and we have been friends for 10 years).

P.S. I couldn't go to see her because I had exams packed every 4 days, on Thursday after my last exam 
I am thinking on visiting her, so I wouldn't mind getting advice on how to talk to her in-person about all of this or how to make her open up about her feelings.

P.S. I am not from USA, if that's relevant."

depression,My experience regarding depression,"Hi all,

I am new to reddit, however I am not new to depression.

I have literally been diagnosed with a few pink F-1/2x diagnoses (psychotropic behavior) and was taking every single possible pill for a few years (anti depressants, mood killers, etc)

Let me start by saying this:

IT IS NOT BAD TO SEEK HELP IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION! No, I am not talking about ""opening"" up to friends/family that most likely will make you a clown and either call you an attention seeking person or just pat you by the back and tell you that it's just a ""period"" and it will pass.

  
IT WILL NOT PASS!!! IT WILL NOT PASS UNLESS YOU TREAT IT!

Don't care what the society will think if you visit a therapist or take pills that will help you heal/pass that stadium in life. It's dark, trust me I know it is dark, I've been literally living in my own shit for months not CARING how I look, what I wear, what I eat or how I smell. 

That's what depression slowly does to you - it kills the purpose to live that every human being should have.

Stay safe friends and always do what is best for you, no matter what the public will think.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: If you suffer from a depression, visit/talk to a professional, not a friend or someone from your family as they will either underestimate the condition you are in or just give shit advises that won't help.

&amp;#x200B;

My 2cents."

depression,"A problem that lead me to attempt suicide twice is kinda getting resolved. But during it, I was thinking about my old friends, and now I am absolutely dead inside waiting if they will answer my messages. (You will die of old age reading this)","As you saw from the title, this is going to be mega long. 

I moved into this brand new building in early october last year, and I have been trying to get fiber (or some kind of permanent connection) ever since.

I am 100% a loner. I am on my computer, I sleep, I eat, I work (part-time), and sometimes I go out to do the groceries.

As I am writing this I seriously think I should stop. I feel so stupid.

So internet. What I did not know at the time was that there wasn't any when I moved in.
That lead to some very confused calls from me to my current (at the time) Internet provider, the main Internet company (my isp is subsodiary or some shit, cannot explain in english), and the costumer service for the company that owns my building.

That person at my isp was telling me this, this other person was telling me that, etc, etc, until I got a call from a superior. She said that I had to do a thing that did not make any sense (sorry, that was so long ago) with the main company. But I told her they told me that I had to pay for that. Kinda like 2 subcribtions. She said you did not have to pay, I answered that they said I had. And so forth.

So I had enough and said ""just delete my contract, I cannot take this anymore"".

Oh my god you guys are actually going to die if I say everything, just don't read it. 

The only internet I had was on my phone, and I was wondering wtf to do.

So my friend (haven't talked to him since) said that I should make a contract with the company that he uses. They could provide me with a 4g box, and wait until real internet arrives. 

With chance, they have a shop right there. I make a contract for my 4g box (that fact is what almost killed me), went back home, plugged it in, and poof I had internet. I had a limit of 100go per month, so I quicly upgraded it to 200. 

The amount to delete the contract increased as well.

But who cares? I was going to get a permanent connexion soon!

So I called the costumer service and asked to make a fiber contract. They said that they could not do it over the phone and I had to go to a boutique.
But it was right there.
Right there the guy said that he could not make fiber contracts from his shop, that I had to go to one of the 2 malls.

This is probably one of the main raison they made me insane. Almost everything is a pain to do with them.

So I walked my ass to the bus station and went to the mall.

Part of the process to make the contract is that they show you a google map kinda thing, and you point your location. 

Before you ask, I have not make a mistake on the location.

Oh my, it said that adsl AND fiber were available!
So of course I chose fiber and got a appointement pretty soon. 

On my day off, perfect. The schedule said 12-16h, but he was here at 8. Even more perfect! 

After a few minutes, he said ""I do not have the right tools, another technician will contact you today"". And he left.
So I called CS (costumer service) to ask them wtf. CS called the technician who told them that he could not install anything because of the rain. 

Mmmm.

So the next day, I called cs again who called the guy again who FINALLY said that the reason he could not install the fiber was because there was no fiber in the building.

I lost, what, 2 days, because of this guy's bs?

So that was back to the bus to the mall for me.

Make an adsl contract. Another appointement very soon. Too suspicious. But wtf did you wanted me to say. I wasn't broken enough back then.

So the technician arrived, and a few minutes later told me that he could not install adsl because there was no adsl in the building.

But he at least had the decency to tell me right away, and even explain to me a few things.
The isp I was with before and the main isp I mentionned a few times have priority on the cables, or the isp I am with now had the get autorization.

Bottom of the line : no matter what happens, my isp would get internet access later than the first 2 isp.

Technician then left. I called cs and we talked about the fact that there was no adsl in the building, and probably would never be, because it would be a waste of money. 

So we talked about adsl, for a while, right?

The next day I got an email saying that my FIBER contract was deleted and there was no way to revert it.

So what happens when there is no adsl? We delete the fiber contract. Yes.

You guys must be dead, right now.

So since nobody could give me a straigt answer at the begining, exept for the technician, I had to call a higher up at my building's company (brother's old classmate) who did some work for me. 

Internet would arrive around valentine's day.

My appointement with the adsl technician was on dec 3. 

I waited patiently. 

Luckuly a commercial (a guy that comes to your house to make contracts) had left his card for the building, and feb 24, my fiber contract was made with an appointement for march 4.

With all the bs that happened to me and the meds that I have to take, now, I have trouble remembering certain things. Like when my sick leave is ending. I swear to god I wrote it down somewhere. I'll just have to go to work to ask.

Anyway. Will never forget march 4. 

The technician arrived. And he stayed longer than the others! 

Nope. A moment later he told me that he could not install the fiber because there was an error in the adress. Like they ordered fiber for somewhere else.

He stayed a while, on the phone with various people, while I was just sitting on my chair, dead inside.

They called me the next day or some shit to try to locate the building (""is there a parking lot on the left"" or some shit), I did not want to make a mistake (I am always like that) so I refused to answer the question. They then asked me if the main company had left a sign with numbers on it. It would indicate perfectly the building. 

I put some fucking clothes on and looked everywhere. Nothing. 

So I demanded that they send a technician or some shit, that would do technician things and say exacly what building it is. He came here. Twice, even. 

He now knew exactly the location, the complicated numbers, all that shit. So he made a report.

But now I had to wait for my order to be completed. The way it works, I think, the main compagny places an order for a certain place to a computer. And then we have to wait. There is no way to know how long the order will take.

This is when it started to get very very annoying.

To call the service that takes care of my stuff, I have to :

-Call the number
-Push *
-Push 1
-Push any phone number in their database that was not deleted, because it does not matter
-Push any number to join any service
-Say the actual phone number you are calling about
-Say your first name
-Say your last name
-Say your date of birth
-Say your adress
-Wait until the person introduces themselves
-Say that you want to join the fiber activation section
-Give a clear reason why 
-NEVER say that you are not at home, even for an update on your order (""yes your order is complete"" ""no your order is not complete""), because they will refuse to talk with you. I had to call again.
-Hope that the call doesn't end abruptly 

Because there are a LOT of services that you cannot join directly. Or some that you cannot AT ALL.

I would call all the time because I had nothing better to do or because I was upset.

So even with the bs with my last appointement (the 3rd), when my order was completed, they could not give me an earlier appointement.

I had an appointement for april 19th. So march 4th to april 19th.

Meanwhile I'm paying 75€ for 200go a month.

Few days before the appointement, I called a few times so that they check that the main company made the order with the numbers in the rapport the guy made.

Guess what happened on the 19th. Exactly the same thing. Exactly the same error. Even though the game came twice. Even though I called them to tell them to check the order.

Oh, and it was even the same technician. He was also very upset that he was put in the same situation twice.

While he was on the phone, I thought about taking my chair to help me jump off.

I was wondering how much I could take. How many technicians, how many phone calls, how many days for an order.

This time, I was more upset because I was suppose to be on my paid time off, april 23 to 29. I was really counting on my fiber, and you know, not mega stressed and angry.

You guys aren't reading anymore, I think.

So you know what I did during that time off? 

I called almost every day to tell them that they ruined my vacation, and that they should have listenned to me (when I said to check the order before the 19th), and that they had commited the same mistake twice in a row)

At that time, all the guys at the service knew me. 

Meanwhile all this bs, the service, and one of the superiors is actually working with the main company (because I guess the 2 other times they weren't????), so that the main company can make the order with the numbers provided by the rapport of the other guy.

And the order waiting started.

But at the same time, the stress was affecting my body too. I have not had my period for 2 months, and then I started to have bad period pain, but barely anything was coming out

So on may 7 I went to the doctor for some pain medicine.
After that, it started bleeding a lot. On may 12, I went back for something that would slow the bleeding (did not help at all).
On the 17 and the 19th (because the med melted because I did not realized it was that hot in my appartement) I went back for a minor problem that was fixed in 2 days.

Meanwhile, OF COURSE, other bs happened. On april 27 maybe, I got a call from their satisfaction service. He wanted to know my experience with a certain phone call. 

At this point, I was at at least 90 phone calls with them (not counting the times they called me). So I told him to leave me alone, something negative about the company, I had to go in the elevator. He said ""since you don't remember, I will call back"".

Someone called from their number, on the 28, but I guess that person's phone had a problem, because I would pick up, and it would immediatly hung up.

He called again on the 30th. Then the 5th may. Then the 7th may.

At this point I think I already called to complain about him (them, honestly, don't know who that fucker is). They cannot find him because he doesn't leave any traces on my file.

Since this bs started I keep my phone on, in case they call to tell me that my order is done and that I am free from their bs.

But with my health problems, I was in sick leave, and sleeping on a weekday. He called twice.

That time, I was not very upset.

But that night, I barely slept, because I felt so unconfortable because of the period blood and have to get up almost every hour to pee blood in the shower and get a thick thing of blood (don't know what it is called in english).

So I was sleeping again in the morning. When he called. At 10.35, 10.40, 11.17, 11.44, 11.45, 12.34 and 13.59.

I called cs to beg them to find him and tell him to stop. 

For those months there was a few crying. But when I was begging cs, I said ""I did not diserved this"". And  could not stop crying. 

I hung up and found an help hotline. They were able to calm down.

At that moment, I went from whatever the fuck I was to depressive. 

The next day, the 19th, I went to the doctor for some refill on the pain medicine and some antidepressants.

So I'm sorry, like I said, with all this bs, and the meds, I forget stuff. I had to get up to check a business card.

Yes, the business card that led me to the 4th march appointement.

Now I remember why I tried to commit suicide the first time.

Between this bs, they told me my order had failed. And said that by deleting the fiber contract and creating a new one, with the same informations, it would magically solve all the problems. 

They said that the same guy that made my contract would come on the 21. 

So the 21 arrives and I realize that they said many times the date, but not the time. I am extremelly tired, and I have to know if I can sleep a bit or just wait. I missed calls during this bs because I was too tired. So I had to know.

I call him. I rings a few times, then hungs up. I call a few more times. Same thing happens.
It is extremmely suspicious. Because when I called him months ago, it would ring a few times, then I would hear the message thing.

I called again and again, and finally it rang once and hung up. 

He was ignoring me.

I called cs and told them to call him, because I knew he would not decline a call from them. Apparently, something came up and he could not come.

Then I begged them to just send another commercial, that it's not complicated.
They told me that I had to go in the boutique. I said not. I am not going. It is not complicated. Then they said they had to give my file to the directors so that they could make a decision.

All the bs, all the tiredness, 3 months of torture. While they were on the phone saying their bs, I took one of my cheap razors and started braking it.

I did not know what I wanted when I started doing it. So I ended up only making superficial cuts. 

A few days before that, I was given the email for cs, so I wrote long emails about the torture, and the guy that was calling me, and other incompetances.

But that day, I took a picture right after I did it, and sent it with a ""I hope you are happy"".

I called the emmergency, put a few things in a bag (in case they wanted me to stay in emergench psychiatry) and waited on the first floor, on the stairs.

They had to call me (important for later), because it is a new building, they needes directions. But you know, like I said. Superficial cuts, was waiting downstairs. I was chill. 

I sent another picture, with doctors in the background, asked some questions, like ""if the order fails, or the technician cannot install the fiber, in how many years will I have it"" with a the end ""I'm adding another picture so that you don't forget me"".

I was surprised that I was able to go back home that same day.

In the emergency room, the psychiatrist gave me a pill, and when I was home, the only thing I wanted to do was sleep.
The next day I went to the doctor and begged him to call the emergency so that he could prescribe me those pills. So that I would not have to wait in mental pain. That was the 22th that I was given this prescription.

The 24th, it was around noon, and I cannot tell you if I was awake or not. But I was talking to my dear friend. I woke up, took my phone, and realized I did not have his number. But I had my other dearest friend's. But that number is almost 10 years old. So no luck.

I told myself ""I have to find the dvd"". One of those 2 friends and 1 female friend went to france to celebrate 1 other friend's 18th birthday.
But I had lost it in years. I thought I acidentally threw it away.

So for the first time that I actually needed it, I asked myself ""where would I put it?""

-it was given to me in a paper enveloppe : too fragile
-I do not own empty plastic boxes
-cardboard sleeves (demo cds) do not have enough space
-I am not getting rid of any cds

And it was in the first plastic box that I hopenned, I swear.

It was a dumb treasure hunt, 18 gifts. 

But it brought back so many memories. We are all internet friends, btw. We would play this free mmo, but we would be all the time on the forum, having fun and what not.

I was elected ""bouffon de la cour"", because I was bringing life to the non gaming section of the forum.
I wanted my friends back. I wanted my sanity back. I wanted to take my dvd with me and jump with it.

I put the dvd in my favorite album, took my phone, took my chair, and headed to the last floor.

It was locked, so I headed downstairs. I sat on my chair, because I knew it would hurt very much if I jumped, and called the emmergencies. 

The person convinced me to get back to my appartement, where I prepared a more serious bag with me (still kept my album) and headed downstairs, again. 

I spent the night in the psychiatry emmergencies. I was the only one.
I have a very bad memory from the day crew, when I left. The psychiatrist was the same from the emmergency room on the 21th, and the only thing he did to help was giving me my pill.

So the 25th, i was still desperate. I sneaked out to the emergy room. One person asked me who I was, and I started running to find something to hurt me.

The emergency staff (not the psychiatry one) held me, sat me down and said stuff like ""the psychiatry staff will talk to you"".

No one talked to me. Execpt the security guard, who told me I needed to find somewhere else to sit down because he wanted to write something.

I sat down in my assigned bed and kept the exact same position for more than 1h30min. I heard them order me a taxi to go home, heard them talk about their lives and stuff, laugh, and someone noticed my car wasn't there yet. Then it arrived and this nurse said, in a normal friendly voice, ""goodbye, madame Edc"". 

I looked her in the eye and said ""you know exactly what is going to happen next time.""

So it was still the 25th, and you are probably more dead than me at this point.

So the 25th, I still want to die, but I want to call someone. The psychologue that I saw during my time in a clinic en 2019.

She calmed me down.

So the 26. God, the 26. I completely forgot about that but it is a little mixed up. On the 21, my appointement with the commercial was moved to the 26. I am following my calls on my phone, at this point.

Commercial still ignoring me. I had enough.

This is where I have to tell you the fondation of this nightmare. The 4g box is my first contract. The others have never been activated, so they are all worth 0€. If I want to leave, I have to pay a fee (it's like between 400 and 600€) because I have an engagement for the 4g box.

They could delete everything. If I had problems. With the 4g box. Even with everything that happened, they don't give a shit and rather make me completely crazy, or dead.

I know this because I had asked multiple times.

But this time, the thought of waiting again, for something that is probably not going to work, the thought of a technician arriving and leaving right after, the thought of my sanity gone.

The razor blade was still there, next to the bed. While this person was talking about giving my file to a director, I took it and cut as long as I could. I kept cutting while that person was still on the phone while screaming in pain and saying ""everything is your fault"". I immediatly took 2 pictures and sent them to cs saying again ""I hope you are happy"".

I can't remember if I made my bag before or after. But anyway, this time, I had to wait the emmergencies in the house. There were drops of blood in a lot of places. The funny thing is that my bed barely felt the difference, with the period blood.

Jesus Christ I am getting bored of my own story.

So in the house they made a bandage thing (sorry, no medical knowledge), but my leg had still blood on it. While waiting in the emmergency room a fly was being very annoying.

I got 19 sutures. Or the doctor counted 19 while looking at every thread. The anesthenic needle hurts, but the sutures don't.
The main doctor visited me and I begged him that I see a psychiatrist, because I could not trust the others.

He helped me quite a lot.
And the next day, the psychiatrist, that I never met helped me out too. He said that I had to choose a nurse because my wounds require caring.

The day before, right after I arrived at the emmergency, my phone rang. It was a commercial. They apparently found one. But I was in the middle of suffering, so I said something mean and hung up.

So the next day I called him back, appologized, and he gave me an appointement for the next day, the 28th!
Good news, but how long and how many times the process was goinc to fail? 

The 28th, I first called the nurse to confirm our appointement. Then I did the same with the new commercial.

He said. He could not come because the directors do not want commercials sent to my house. 

I was so close. All he had to do was get there, and make the contract. I was going to get the contract, and legit not call them. Let them call me when the order or whatever would or not be ready.

I broke in tears, and called the nurse to cancel our appointement.

I took my album, my phone, my chair, and went up.

Execpt this time, I did not sat on the chair. I sat on the stairs. I called the commercial, who ignored me. I cannot remember whag cs said. Then I receive a call from the emmergencies. The nurse called them. Like always, they pass me the call to a doctor. 

I was still broken. She said things like ""we sent the emmergencies for you multiple times right?"".
She would not understand what I was saying.

How the fuck how I suppose to explain all of this in like 5 minutes? 

She said she would send an ambulance, and hung up, I think. I went back to my house to make another bag. 

Called the commercial, because I wanted a reason for this bs, tried to call my old psy, again, but she already left work, called a help hotline, called the commercial again, then cs for 25min. No idea what I talked about.

Noticed something strange? No ambulance.
That fucking bitch could have killed me.

So I called the nurse again so he could come back. I went to the store close to my house. To beg if they could make a contract for me. Apparently they have the materiel now, but it was close to closing and the necessary guy had left already. Apparently I finished the day with a 25min call to cs. No idea. Don't ask me.

On the 29th. 3 am. Could not sleep. Saw an email. Could not sleep anymore. They deleted my contrat for my 4g box and I had to pay 400€. At one point the net stopped working. They had deleted it. Had to wait until 6am (out of all the bs, thank god cs opens at 6) to sort this out.

So because they are incompetants, they misinspreted what I said and started the process of deleting. But I sent a ""wtf is wrong with you I never said this"" and they were like ""ah ok sorry"". But they didn't cancel the deleting.

Because the directors or whatever, I went back to the shop because maybe the guy would be there and I also forgot everything else the other guy said.
I asked ""do you make fiber contracts"" ""yes, what adress"" ""that adress"" ""na they don't have it here"" ""wwwwhat"" ""listen, I live there, I know. Let me call J. Hey J, there is this lady here, here is her number"" (this is a very dumbed down version of the conversation).

So J calls me right away and gives me an appointement for this afternoon. I'm confused, because I have no idea what his job his. 

So basically J hooked me up with the isp I was with before, because cunt company knew they didn't had access to the fiber and was going to make me turn in circles until I litteraly die.

But those cunts did it again with the ""the client said not to delete"", and the other guy was probably wearing his headphones or something.
I have a bill for 233€, the lady said not to worry about it, but I screamed at her to tell the service to make a new bill. Because, of course they fucking forgot, because they are cunts : they owe me money. I'll call again to remind them.

Like, fuck me, I wasn't going to call them again and they start their bs. 

And you know what ? My period finally stopped. Guess when.

Those motherfucking cunts almost killed me.

But to come back to the title. I have this friend I know is on steam, but he hasn't been on for a few days.

And this other friend. Holy fucking shit. I made a facebook and Instagram account to find him and contact him. But those accounts are too old.
Then I was like ""what is a popul... twitter"". I think I found him. His account is private but I saw that someone answered to him in sept 2020. 

God, I feel so empty, I just want this cunt company to die and me having what I've been fighting all along for. Fucking fiber.

And talk a little to my friends. Just a little.

So if you are insane like me and read everything : I sent the photos and kinda (really) harassed them because I want them to remember until they die that it is their fault. They made me go fucking crazy. I never harmed myself before, or took a chair as high as I could.

I have no idea if I can come back from this. 

Dude, like every time I have a real conversarion like this, nobody answers.

And the fucking keyboard on this phone, I swear to god.

And another thing that PISSES me off : the psychiatrists have appointements until like july or some shit. And psychologists are not riembursed.

Alright, bye to myself, looks like I have to wait until 6am again, if I do not see that bill fixed I'll be super stressed again."

I truly believe now that I'm a less being than anyone around, I'm the bad guy in my family and in my life, I'm the one who needs to be casted away.

I'm thinking of breaking up my engagement with my GF because I feel like I'm a danger to her and her future, she doesn't deserve that. 

I've developed memory problems because I've been accused many time of forgetting the things that started the problems. 

I have developed anger issues and really really dark thoughts of self hate and self damage.

I believe I'm beyond saving at this point. So I just wanted to write this down here, I don't seek help or salvation, I'm not worth that anymore.

Thanks for reading."
depression,My friends had a party and went out of their way to ensure I wasn't there.,"They made a new group chat and specifically told people to not mention it to me or put it up on an Instagram or snapchat that I could see. Only found out about it because someone didn't follow that last rule and when I asked them they came clean. 

So yeah I don't have any friends anymore."

depression,I hate dealing with my parents,"Where’s the “thanks for taking out the trash” or “thanks for washing the dishes”? I know I’m supposed to do it anyway but what’s the point in only pointing out when I forget to do something? Wow I forgot to take out the trash once out of the last 10 times, now I have to hear about how I fucked up for the next week. Where’s the motivation? Especially when you’re as fucking lazy and forgetful as I am. Annoying"

depression,"100% loser, what to do!!"," 

I'm 45 man from Egypt, software developer. 5 years ago, I met a nice lady from Lithuania (an EU country) and I moved there, married her and found a job there. Later, she divorced me and I cannot keep a job for more than a year. Three places fired me after a year in each because I was not good enough as they expected. I think I'm not good enough yes, I'm from a third world country, old and I cannot be good like young European developers.

Now, I have no family, no friends and soon I will have no job. That divorce I had was my second one and I don't want to look for another job because I will end up with the same result, being fired again. I don't want get back to Egypt either, I have no one there and there is no future in that country. I think I have no friends here because people are afraid of someone like me from the middle east.

I'm old and I have been living with my cats only for more than a year. I'm thinking about killing myself but because I'm a 100% loser, I'm extremely worried to fail and to have a permanent disability to live with. I called the suicide hotline but they kept me waiting and ended the call later.

If someone has any other choice to me, please write it down but don't give false hopes or life coaching nonsense.

Thanks"
depression,Has my boyfriend stopped taking antidepressants so he can game more?,"My boyfriend used to take his antidepressant pill once a day, he told me he’s been on antidepressants since his teens (he’s now 27). However since he’s got a gaming computer he spends all of his time and energy on it. First it was weight gain (he complained about it to me, I told him I didn’t care as long as he’s happy but if he’s really worried he should just do a bit more movement like go on walks. Next was a doctors trip, his vitamin d levels are insufficient so the doctor recommended he go outside. And thirdly was the antidepressants, he hasn’t picked up a new prescription for 2 months! I keep asking him and he tells me he will but he just hasn’t. 

I’m worried he’s getting his dopamine release from staying on the computer, and he’s not even always gaming sometimes he just browsed random things on google. 

It’s getting excessive, he isn’t taking care of himself anymore, he wakes up to game (I woke up at 8am today to see that he had already started gaming) and plays until it’s time to go to sleep. 

I’m posting in the depression subreddit because if this is an issue with his mental health then I want to try to help him. 

It’s also one thing to note that when I do bring up outdoor activities he calls me controlling, when I bring up excessive computer time he says I’m using it as a scapegoat for our other problems. He deflects anything to do with the computer or going outdoors and I don’t know what to do anymore."
depression,Self-mutilation,"I did it. I am not proud of it. It was not an irrational choice, it was a calculated tactic for handling depression. Although it was rational, I did not really think things through, because many months have passed since I cut myself, and yet, the scars are very visible. I stopped wearing T-shirts because of this, and I never take my shirt off if someone is near. I can't go to a pool, I can't go to the beach, because of the scars. I am afraid that someone might see them, and I will be judged. I did not think that I cut so deep as to leave visible scars.

How do you explain this to another person, if discovered? How can they understand? Mental health is a touchy subject, even taboo in some geographical areas. Is it better to keep it all in yourself, or get out there and risk being misunderstood or judged?

I stopped cutting myself a long time ago. A small victory, but still a victory.

Anyone feel me?"
depression,I want to kill myself even though I am at the happiest point in my life.,"  

I have been a chronically depressed and self-harming for the past 5-6 years of my life (I can’t really remember what it feels like to be happy anymore). I just remember existing in a void of space, patiently waiting for my end. What came next, I did not expect. 

Three years ago, I used to be a teacher assistant for one of my community college classes and about 4 months ago, one of the students from that class got back to me online, we started talking, she confessed her feelings for me and now, we have been dating for almost two months. It would be a disgraceful lie to say that these past few months did not bring me the biggest joy in my life. I question every day, why someone like her would ever want to be with someone like me. She is incredibly smart, kind, patient, forgiving, and just outworldly gorgeous. When we just started talking and she confessed her feelings for me, I did my utmost best to explain to her my mental health situation, because I knew that I would end up falling for her and eventually I will become a burden for her. This is exactly what happened, unfortunately. 

I fell for her even harder that I expected. Not only because she is my first girlfriend, but also because of how much I admire her as an individual. But sometimes, this only makes things worse. Nowadays, I spend most of my days contemplating my insecurities and just being stuck in my head, imagining ridiculous scenarios of how she will eventually dump me because of myriad of reasons: my jealousy of her past, my insecurities about my personality, etc. I glob as many relationships advice videos as I can to find tips on how to handle my insecurities, my depression and suicidal thoughts, and not bother her with my mental health issues all the time, but whenever I seek her help, she is always incredibly supportive and helps me to go through my emotions. However, I feel like she is getting tired of having to comfort me all the time and assuring me of her feelings to me. 

On one hand, I am being pushed forward by my wonderful girlfriend, who I do not deserve, but who I love and care for, with all my heart. On the other hand, I am being pulled back by my past, my insecurities about her past and myself, the thoughts of making her a favor and taking my life. Some days, my love for her gets me through the day easily. Other days, I can’t stop thinking about ending it all for her sake, because I don’t want to hold her down as an individual. 

Today, I was driving on a highway and for no reason, I went to a left lane and sped up to 85 mph. For a second, I was hoping I would get crashed and die in an accident, but then quickly regrouped myself mentally. 

I am sorry for long post, but I just needed a space to share."
depression,part of me wishes i didnt have friends so i would stop comparing myself to them,"they have family that cares and understands them, they live in a developed country where all their needs are met, they are happy with what they have, they are not suffering from an illness. i envy them so much because they have it so much better than me. i just wish i wasnt born to an abusive parents in a third world country where its impossible for me to get proper healthcare."
depression,Life,I've gotten to the point where I don't know what to feel anymore which is mostly psychologically.. over the years I feel that I've numbed even more than I used to be. I have no interest in almost everything but somehow still manage to force myself to do things. I suppose this is more of a desire than motivation. I still struggle to not reject any form of happiness. It's really scary out there and nobody can prepare you for it. All you can really do is learn and try your best to not repeat the same mistakes.

depression,Even before the sudden loss of my mom I felt disgusted by this world and how cruel it is. I’m not cut out for it.,"Some of you may remember me from the post I made here when my mother died and I got such great encouragement and support and I cannot thank you all enough for that, but here I am again possibly worse off than before. Here’s what’s going on currently.


For along time now I have been experiencing what I think is an existential crisis due to the ugly state of the world in particular the USA. Whether it’s the government being corrupt top to bottom, whether left or right, from grassroots local govt all the way up to the president. The racial tension, toddlers being taken from their bed and killed, Covid 19 and the great mask debate, I just loath a lot of, if not most of humanity. So much so I slipped into a deep depression and became completely isolated. Just completely sick of it all.

And then around two weeks ago I lost my only family, my mother, suddenly to cancer and wasn’t able to see her before she passed. Besides my young daughter she was all I had, we are a poor family… I’m a single dad of a beautiful little girl whose mother bailed on her when she was 2 and not so much as a birthday card or phone call since. Because I was the only relative I had Drive six hours two have her body cremated because it was all I could afford and even that drained my savings and I had to open up multiple credit cards just to cover it all. I don’t care about the money I just wish so badly that my daughter and I could have spent some time with her before she passed. 

In the weeks following I feel I have out of body experiences, more like it’s not real… Like I am living in my own personal hell where one thing after another goes terribly wrong. My daughter is becoming a young lady and all that goes with that and I have no female mother figure for her to talk to about these things, i’ve checked out books from the library and scoured the Internet and giving her the best advice I can. But it’s not the same.

Even though we lived six hours away my mother and my daughter were very close, and my daughter has taken her passing very hard which is to be expected, I’ve tried my best to keep a strong face and help her through it but it hasn’t been all that effective. 

Shortly before my mother passed a stray kitten wandered onto our porch and immediately bonded with my daughter like I had never seen before, wouldn’t leave her side, slept in her bed, played with her outside… It has been so nice and cathartic to see her so happy with “chonkers” her cat.

Well wouldn’t you know it, as my personal hell would have it… The cat has become ill. I had planned on saving some money and paying down some credit cards so that I could take the cat to get its shots and have it fixed, but I don’t think it’s going to make it that long… From what I’m reading about the symptoms it’s most likely a parasite but I cannot find a vet who is willing to treat it and bill me as opposed to money up front. No sliding scale vets, and the university veterinarian hospital that treats for free sometimes has a waiting list months long.

The only reason I I’m writing about that part of it is because watching her happiness was is keeping me going. Now watching her cry because of the condition her cat is in and knowing it’s dying it’s just tearing me apart. I haven’t had any suicidal thoughts, I’m just exhausted and have nothing left in the tank to fight the depression and I’m just very scared I’m going to be stuck in this dark hole forever. 

I miss my mom so much, I lost my dad years back and I miss him so much too. These are the people that have always been there for me and my times of despair and now they’re gone. I called my local crisis line and they are putting me in touch with some counselors who work pro bono but the wait is very long which I’m assuming is due to a very large percentage of the nation dealing with depression because of Covid and a litany of other things. 

It helps me to get this stuff off my chest and I suppose that’s why I’m posting… I am not a thoughts and prayers kind of guy but please send positive energy to my daughter and her cat I hope so much he is able to pull through or that I can finds vet willing to work with me and my current situation. 

TLDR; I have been dealing with an existential crisis and depression for about a year, it was progressively getting worse and then my mother died suddenly of cancer a couple of weeks ago. I traveled to have her cremated and try to get back to “normal“ life to keep our heads above water, our lights on, and food in our bellies. My daughters stray cat who is her best friend has become ill and there’s nothing I can do for it, watching her watch it die is killing me. Just looking for some love and support

Thanks"
depression,I don’t feel normal anymore. Can’t tell if this is some kind of depression...,"Hi guys, 19 year old hypochondriac here. I feel like I’m slowly losing myself honestly. I’ll start off on a whim saying that nothing feels normal, everything has changed. I think this is due to the combination of changes in my life, health anxiety, smoking weed, and looking at everything in a new perspective. This “new perspective” is absolutely destroying me. I’m constantly thinking about death and not existing (not like suicidal thoughts AT ALL. Just like a fear of death per se). I’m really worried that I’m on the brink of losing my mind. My first plan of action is to lay off on the weed, then find a therapist for this shit. I feel like this is a common mid-life thing that college kids go through but I don’t know how to label it. I don’t feel like I’m disassociating or anything, I really just feel like I’m looking at everything in this new perspective and I don’t feel like my normal self anymore. I still enjoy doing things like riding my bike, making and playing music, playing video games, etc. But I feel like I’m counting the days down now and not making the days count. I dunno. It’s so hard to explain. Nothing is the same like it used to be, but not in a bad way I guess. Do any of you guys sort of relate? You just miss how you used to feel before?"
depression,I'm 20 and having an existential crisis.,"I'm only 20 years old and after looking forward to the end of exams and the beginning of summer for months. When it finally arrived, I just couldn't make myself feel as excited as I expected to be about them.

For the first time in my life I started being excessively worried and frightened about death. I can't seem to accept the idea of death and existing. I still tried to go out with friends, but it didn't feel the same and they could tell ""something's wrong"".

I'm less motivated now even to continue with my hobbies that I have been so consistent with over the last year. My only hope is that this terrible feeling will pass and I can get back to my normal self. Does anyone have similar experiences?"

, just respecting that he goes to work atleast everyday. hes also a migrant so he doesnt have great speech with our language but i dont care about that eaither but what i care about is that hes realy hopeless like its realy mean by me to say this but his intelligence is very low and it realy annoys me its like living with a handicap. I realy hate also how hes very bad socially, he tries to start these cringe conversation sometimes and i realy get angry how hes feeling uncomfortable in the house with us and absolutely hates when he gets nervous when he talks with me like hes such a loser and i hate to think that too. And hes not even trying to improve himself. Sometimes hes even doing things he doesn’t know how to do and it just turns bad. Sometimes i just wanna live with my mother instead as i can see her as a real person but i feel guilty by leaving my father because then he’ll be really lonely. How should i act?"

depression,Going off my meds,"I’ve (21 F) been on and off medication for anxiety and depression for almost 7 years now. In some ways I’ve grown and have gotten better from when I first started treatment. However, some aspects of my mental health seem like they haven’t improved at all. I’ve tried multiple medications and therapists and I’m kinda just done.

I’m not giving up on life or myself, but I just don’t know if medication is right for me anymore. I’ve kinda hit a plateau and I’m just so exhausted. I don’t want to have to take 5 pills a day to function anymore. I really don’t know if things will get worse or better from here.

In the beginning of the year I injured my back and have gone to the docs multiple times but they just won’t help. My injury makes it hard to do most things, and I feel like it’s starting to effect (affect? Who gives a shit) my mental health. Between me being overseas and my injury, I’m at my wits end. I just can’t take this anymore, I can’t find enjoyment in things I used to do, like play games or just generally anything. The thought alone of eating makes me want to vomit and my back pain makes it near impossible to get a full nights rest. I feel so drained and so out of it. I’ve talked to my leadership about going to behavioral health but I’m scared that it’ll effect (affect? I need to stop using that word) my career. I’m scared that going to behavioral health will get me disqualified from doing my extra duties (basically I’m in charge of the weapons in my unit). And what really sucks is I’m usually a pretty happy go lucky guy, I like cracking jokes and generally being the funny guy, but recently it just takes to much to be, “there”, if that makes sense. I feel like I have so much to say but just can’t find the words to say it. Anyway, that’s my spiel, thank y’all if you made it this far."
depression,"Want to be alone, but I'm lonely too","I live alone, I don't really have any friends. Literally 2 and I haven't talked to them more than a couple short texts in months. The most socializing I do is at work, and even that's not much. And I kind of like it like that. Being around people is stressful. 

But I still get lonely. I'm always by myself, I have no one and sometimes I just want to be touched, hugged, to lay next to someone. 

I'm pretty sure I'm asexual or close enough as makes no difference. But I still want *some* kind of intimacy. 

I haven't been hugged in months, I haven't kissed someone in at least 2 years. I haven't shared a bed with someone in 2 years. 5 years before that brief intimacy hiatus. 

I like my fortress of solitude, but I wish I could just have someone to sleep next to me, not sex or anything just affection once in a while."

depression,"My friend is depressed, has inferiority complex, hates himself for being weak and doesn't ""want"" to change and seek therapy.","Hello everyone. 

We live in Iran; so there's that.

It's been almost five years that a friend of mine suffers from depression. I think it first started when he fell in love with a girl who never really cared about him, wasted two years of his life on her and when he moved on, he was faced with a huge university entrance exam and since he hadn't studied much, he didn't do good and got low scores, decided to wait one more year so he could give that soul-crushing exam one more time (yes, it crushes students in Iran, since studying Medicine is the only way to guarantee a well-paid life in this country; other jobs can't really pay off) and this time he intended to be more prepared; but again, he couldn't make it.

So to avoid mandatory military draft, he had no choice but to go for a low-ranked major. So he's been a university-student for two years now.

Again, he fell in love with a girl in their class; they got friends, he really didn't express his love for her, she got into a relationship with another guy(who was a total ass), some stuff happend afterwards and my friend just cut off any connections with the girl.

It send him into the deeper depths of depression and he was coming up with sentences like ""I'm just a fucked-up guy, life always intends to fuck me up, it's the way of life for me and there's nothing I can do, I was born to be fucked, I'm meant to suffer"" and questions like ""why me? Why should all this shit happen to me?"".

After about eight months or so, she broke up with that guy, befriended my friend again, they got close and eventually he confessed his love for her, but she rejected; she's planning on migrating to Germany within a year. So she doesn't wish to form a love bond with someone at the moment, for it'll make the soon-to-come departure harder.

They still talk, they're still friends, they fight over trivial crap like little children. But the main problem he's facing rn, is that deeply believes himself to be a ""weak sick impotent mind"". He can't even maintain a daily routine for just a week. He sometimes has short periods of beneficial activies due to my motivational speeches, but then relapses again. And he believes that therapy does not work and those who have survived depression through therapy, are ""delusional, they just 'think' that they've gone better"".

What can I do to convince him to visit a therapist?"
depression,About to go off the edge.,"I can feel it inside of me I’m trying my best to block my mind from the truth but it keeps eating away at me. I wonder what would be less painful, fucckckkkkk I can’t think right now I’m in a panic. No one can save me now why why why why cant I just be a normal depressed person. I don’t want pills I just want to be normal. I’ve only ever wanted to be normal. The abyss is starring at me and eventually I’ll go inside of it but I don’t want it to be anytime soon god please why were any of us BORN there has to be a reason why I suffer why why did you put me here? 

It’s so hard to fucking sleep at night then I wake up early in the morning don’t sleep well it becomes 1-2pm I finally get in the mood to sleep but can’t. If I wasn’t born would I just be in another body or would I be no where and at peace for eternity? I’d be fine if I was ignorant for my entire life without sadness and with security. That’s it. I need something to believe in. If I could believe that all this meant something I’d be half ok again. Death isn’t a answer I don’t know what’s after death and it’s too risky to try to suicide and what if I fail and everything is worse....????? Maybe a hero will shoot me to death?? 

But tomorrow I’ll be ok again and thinking about dumb stuff that doesn’t matter. This is the truth. That’s not bad though as ignorance is bliss. No matter what being ignorant is better than having the knowledge. I say god help me because I have no one and even if I did they wouldn’t understand me and even if I did have someone who understood me then what???? That wouldn’t fit in the tut reality. This sucks so fucking bad I’m going to cry fuck fuck fuck someonr something save me"
depression,Trying to say goodbye to a suicidal friend,"I'm writing this with a heavy heart. 

I know him since not long ago, but we became very close in the last few weeks. He's such a good person, loves animals and climbing. I feel so calm and confortable when I'm with him.

Since day 1 he told me he has suicidal thoughts. Not every every once in a while, but multiple times a day. He already did therapy and is in medication, the strongest there is. I understand, I also take medication for anxiety disorder and helped me a lot. But in his case, these thoughts are still there.

Yesterday after we when climbing together I asked him what still holds him here, in this life. He has been through a lot, has a child, is studying, has money, friends that love him. I thought we was going to say something, maybe he still wanted to wait to finish a book, or the thought of his son growing up, or maybe keep pushing himself to climb a harder path, or see me again or anyone again. 

He said he doesn't know, that he already tried but didn't find that time and thing that killed him finally. That he will probably eventually do it, that it's matter of time. 

I try to understand, but I really just want to hold his hand and show him everything that excites me, with the hope he grabs onto something, anything. 

I feel like such a bad friend, how can I be so egoistic to think I can save him from his suffering. I'm having such a hard time trying to wrap my head around his possible suicide and his now suffering. 

I'm going to tell him it's ok. That I will try not to be mad or sad if he does it. That I will try to understand. That he's not being selfish. That I will remember him. That we all love him. That he tried. 

Thank you for reading, take care."

I have no real easily identifiable reason to feel like I do, things in my life are going fine, studies, friends, family, girlfriend etc. 

I can go a long time feeling fine. But right now, it's worse than ever, I just feel so fucking bad deep inside of me, a part of me would just wish that I could die suddenly and not have to bother anymore. Though I should be clear I'm not thinking of taking my life, don't think I could ever do that. 

I do easily get anxiety and stress about the future (lot's of hopeless- and pointlessness). I guess it's also hard for me because I don't feel like I can talk about this with anybody, at least not in depth. My girlfriend I've told to some extent and I think she can tell (she's very supportive), but I don't want to burden her and I fear bringing her with me down that road. Same goes with friends and family to some extent, I don't want people worrying about me either. 

I don't have any formal diagnosis for anything, never got it looked at either (just went to talk to someone last year of high school). I don't know if I'm depressed, previously I've had problems with eating, sleeping, I have a lack of sense of joy or interest for anything, and once again I'm starting to feel this way, and an overwhelming feeling of sadness, without being able to cry or move on from it. Maybe this is just more of an offmychest thing, I don't know where to turn or what to do, just feel really bad holding it inside."
depression,Ready to snap,"I think I've reached the end of my tether.

Last year I had a meltdown at work and walked out of my job. I'd tried to see a doctor about getting time off my job but he just put me on antianxiety meds.

I've been out of work since December and got a job interview in a couple of hours. Only the landlord upstairs has decided to change the flooring in his flat above mine today. 

Since moving into my flat, every day has been constant noise from loud footsteps to barking dogs to guitar playing to loud conversations.

Due to the noise I've put my flat up for sale but nobody is interested in buying it.

Everyday I live with noise cancelling headphones and earplugs on. I can't relax without alcohol. Even though I've a job interview I am already drinking.

The last date I had, the woman cancelled the dinner, and then went out with her ex instead, without telling me she was going to be late and that we'd no longer be eating together.

The one before that took the condom off without asking me, told me she'd been tested, then changed her story the next day and joked about giving me HIV. When I tell people about this some are sympathetic and other think its funny and my own fault. (I've been tested and thankfully OK)

I've been stuck in my fucking flat for a year now due to pandemic and the isolation is killing me. 

I've been having memories about something that happened to me when I was a teenager that I don't know whether they are real or not.

It all just feels too much now."
depression,"My life just isn't getting any better, and I'm sure I fucked up my future.","I know for a fact that I'm ashamed because I fucked up my life bad. It isn't about drugs or crime, just that my depression has made me so disconnected from reality that I feel nothing except anger and very rarely sadness. It hurts to be happy. I feel almost nothing except those two emotions from time to time and the anger one is the strongest out of them.

I'm ashamed to be a fuck up and still successful because I know I shouldn't be depressed. Sometimes it feels like my life is coming to an end and that's very soon. I've been trying to self-harm but the pain isn't what's keeping me from doing it, just the tools that I have available. Keep in mind that this needs to be a secret too, so I can only cut myself on my chest area, or my back."

depression,"Need Some Help on Appearing ""Socialized""/Normal","People can tell there's something wrong with us, we're not socialized correctly and don't understand how building a friend group works. 

If anyone has any actual information/book suggestions on how to learn this stuff I'd appreciate it. Stuff like ""How to Make Friends and Influence People"" doesn't work (people don't like ass kissers). 

Actual information on how to appear properly socialized and normal is sparse because 99.99% of unsocialized people never actually learn how, and those who do don't bother writing down the information..."
depression,How do I apologize after lashing out because of a trigger?,"This morning the girl I've been dating sent me a clip of of her in the office trying to shoo away a pregnant trying to nest at her desk, where she said ""If you don't go away I'll kick you!""

Of course she didn't actually mean it, but being out of sorts from sleep deprivation, I reacted adversely and told her along the conversation that hypothetically, I wouldn't want to work with her because I'd probably react much worse if I heard what she said firsthand. She asked if it would be enough to make me break things off, to which I replied, ""I don't know.""

I then proceeded to tell her raw what I felt, which was just disgust--physiological revulsion. That soured the conversation and stopped talks.

This afternoon, she told me that she was put off by what I said, as if such a petty thing as a cat was enough for me to end things. I shared more of what I experienced, which was a triggering of childhood witnessing of animal cruelty, a growing sense of aimlessness and frustration about my life the past few years, and a reminder of how similarly cruel my ex could be. I also told her I was hurt that she thought I could let things go so lightly when I have always told her how much I loved and cared for her and had always lent an ear when I could. Communication broke down, though, as I felt her tone wasn't kind (which of course, is a big ask considering she was also in a bad mood), and I proceeded to just keep screaming ""I'm in the wrong!"" repeatedly.

I want to apologize, I do. And I understand her point that such a small thing (a cat) leading to this situation reflects doubtfulness of how I'd handle other confrontations.

At the moment we've decided to put off talking until we cool our heads.

Have any ideas, anyone? Would greatly appreciate your input."
depression,How to survive college with depression,"Hi guys. 

I’m currently at college finishing my major.
I’m an ambitious person by nature and I am somehow surviving this whole college experience but AT WHAT COST. It’s so tough even though it’s online, I am literally crying during exams and then I have to sleep till evening because I’m so tired. I struggle with taking care of myself and my surroundings. I only have couple of good days and that’s when I want to party and meet people and I am all cheerful - but it lasts short and then I am again in my darkness and stress. I was diagnosed with depression (my psychiatrist was not sure if I am bipolar or not because I’m still young and he is still diagnosing me).
Any tips for surviving college with depression? I am often close to quitting this fucking thing.

Thank you."

depression,I wish I would die from a natural cause,"I don't have suicidal thoughts and the way I'm thinking right now I would never consider it but I just wish I'd die from a natural cause such as cancer or heart failure. That way I don't have to ""live"" anymore and my relatives wouldn't feel any sort of guilt or blame. 

I'm almost 25 and have done basically nothing in life. I have 1 year left to finish my degree but I can't find any interest in doing so (have paused university for 2 years now) just like anything else I see other people do. Like, where is the joy in going for a walk, having a drink outside, or going to the pool? Everything is just so dull to me, I don't even want to do these things. So why should I even finish school? To spend pretty much my whole day working for money I am not going to spend because I have no interests, what's the point? Never had a girlfriend, and it's not because I'm so unattractive or a terrible person, but I literally don't have interest in starting a relationship with people since I was 12 or so. Grown apart from most of my childhood friends, the ones I still talk to every now and then have become people who I just game with. They think I'm doing fine and have other friends I hang out with IRL, because I fake that impression to not look like a complete loser who stays at home pretty much 24/7. I've been spending a lot of time on a certain game the past 1-2 years and I've just realized how useless and pathetic it is, but atleast it has kept me busy and distracted from the sad reality.

I'm a mess, just like this rant or whatever it is. People always say to talk about your feelings, but I have never done that. I don't want my parents (or anyone else really) to wrongly feel guilty or anything, because I would wish every person had parents like mine. They have done nothing wrong, no one has really. I don't know why I feel like this, I can't think of something in my life that could have triggered this depression I have. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I guess I like the anonymity, and maybe someone can relate and can feel a little bit less lonely, knowing there are other people in similar situations out there. Maybe you've felt like this and recovered, I would love to hear what has helped you."

depression,Lying to save my ex from my depression,"My depression has filled me with self hatred. My ex did take advantage of my good heart. But when she did this, she explained she was afraid I was to good and she truly feared the depth of her love for me. This was the teith too. But because I hate myself so much my depression convinced me all I’m good for is being hot and used for my body and I hurt her assuming she did it because all I was good for is my looks. I let my depression convince me to hurt her. And now, I’ve realized she does deserve more. Besides being good looking I suck. Yeah I’m super loving and kind. But my mental illness hurt her proving in worthless and she deserves more. I’m lying and tell her I’ve moved on so she’ll find a better man that isn’t mentally ill. I love her so my so much. But all I deserve is misery."
depression,"I have everything one could ask for, then why do I still feel depressed?","I have everything, a loving family, great friends, food, water and a roof to live under. I’m provided with everything that I could possibly ask for within my parents reach. Yet I still can’t help be sad. I’m a young girl, I shouldn’t feel depressed, teenage years are for having fun and taking risks, yet here I am, never getting out of bed and wanting to cease my existence. 

I’ll never do it though, I have seen what it does to people. I’m not that selfish ,I love my family and would never want to see them in such pain. So I wish that people would forget about me, so I can do whatever I want without the feeling of guilt. Is the too selfish of me to ask? Probably. 

My family isn’t perfect, no one is. They used to fight, a lot. Even the pettiest of things would have everyone at each other’s throats. They’d scream and shout , my brother would always talk about wanting to run away, dad and mom weren’t any help either. But we had good moments too, rare but good. I still think about them often and get happy. My family isn’t perfect but they try their best. When they realised what the fighting was doing to me, they tried their best to stop, I was even hopeful for a couple of days that everything would go back to normal. But life isn’t all fairies and daisies now is it?

I think seeing my family slowly drift apart is what started my sadness, or at least enhanced it. Lockdown hasn’t helped either. I didn’t even consider having depression till yesterday, when I randomly opened an article expecting to leave without any consequences but ended up relating to almost every symptom. I still can’t believe it though, I have no reason to have depression, my life is perfectly normal, yet here I am.

My depressive state is taking a toll on my family, I can see that. They worry about me and I can see they’re trying their best to lift me up. Yet I can’t help but sink further and further. I’m the problem, the reason my family is so broken. I am the reason. 

So I’ve decided that I want to seek help. But how? I don’t feel comfortable discussing what’s going on with any of my friends. Why? Well because I’m not supposed to be depressed. I’m the happy go lucky and funny friend, how can I be sad. I wanna reach out for help, I just don’t know how. I don’t wanna tell my parents, I don’t want to be more of a disappointment than I already am. 

My brother is my only ray of hope of ever getting help. He wasn’t the best older brother growing up. We used to fight a lot and never had any kind of sibling bond whatsoever. He has anger issues and used to lash out on me sometimes. But I can see he’s trying now. He talked to me about my mental health recently and I ended up telling him some of the stuff I think about. He said he’s always there if I need to talk about anything and even opened up about some of his own personal struggles. Yet I can’t bring myself to tell him that I might have depression and that I need help, and it fills me with guilt. Why am I like this? Why can’t I just open up? It would help everybody. So i’ll try telling him over text tonight. I can’t do it face to face but it might help that I can’t see his face while doing it. I’ll try my best.

Sorry you had to listen to my sob story.
Thankyou for letting me vent, it helped."

depression,State of the world makes me feel exhausted,"Like many people, I didn't closely pay attention to the news until the sickness hit last year. Now that I consume more news and dig into history I am extremely overwhelmed with sadness, anger, and disbelief.

I used to be hopelessly optimistic about the general good in 99% of people. 

How are people so cruel to each other? How is it so difficult to coexist?

I've withdrawn from friends because I don't want to constantly complain about the news /world but that is not sustainable. Everything feels pointless because nothing will change or improve.

I have successfully quit smoking for 6 weeks but it feels like an exercise in futility since I'm not sure that the avoidance of disease and possible increase in lifespan be worth the effort.

At this point I’m pretty convinced I’m a narc, and since I’m poor and can’t afford therapy or to get away from the world, I think the best thing for me to do, to spare anyone else the disappointment and potential pain of knowing me, is to end my life soon.

The last 2 days I’ve been having horrible thoughts, I don’t think I’d ever go through with them but I can’t help thinking about it constantly the last couple days. I’ve tried to talk to my sister in law about and all she said was “you’re not depressed”, my husband doesn’t really fully understand my depression even though I’ve talked to him about it, and my mom completely brushed me off and just started playing with the baby instead of hearing me out.

And now I learn that he’s living with someone else. This is killing me because it means that I was the reason, not that he didn’t want to live with someone.

And now they are telling me that i have to wait even longer, and couldn't tell how long the waiting list actually was?? (I've been told in januari 8 weeks, well that was awefully wrong wasn't it)

I feel cheated. I've been waiting for so long, day by day to one day finally get help. And now they are telling me i have to wait for what could be another year? Maybe two???

I've had a burnout. A depression followed, and i don't have the motivation to do anything lately, but i've been trying. All because they told me to be patient and that they would help me.

Now i've learned that i have to do this alone, and it more than just suckes.

It feels like i've been given false hope just to string me along for good buisiness, for when it came down to it they could slam me to the ground to make a point.

depression,feeling like I’m having a bad trip,"Hello. I don’t know if this is the place to inquire about such an issue but I’m lost. From about November 2020 - March 2021 I was in a state of feeling like I’m in a nightmare. My stomach would be in pain, I would have a lump in my throat as if I was on the verge of tears and this strange feeling in my heart as if it were having an orgasm or something. I would be distracted from the feeling for a little while and then become panicked when the thoughts arose again. Some days were better than others but for those months I was almost constantly in distress. There was no person I could talk to about it because in my head nobody was real, and/or the world was playing a prank on me. I went to a therapist but it didn’t seem to help as she made me feel like there was something strange about my case, driving me to believe I was going insane or something.

depression,How do you cope with childhood trauma/parental rejection in your adult life?,"I am woman in my early 30s, I have been suffering from depression all my life. I was suicidal between the age of 10 to 28. I tried 2 times and failed. Then I just don't have the courage to do it again. 

Childhood trauma shaped who I am now. I am very quiet person, introvert, dull, and very negative. 

I was rejected by my mother and father emotionally since I can remember things. They had been emotionally abuse me all my life. My mother doesn't love me because she said I am the reason that trapped her in a miserable marriage. They are conservative, they fight all the time but do not accept a divorce. My mother always say that if it wasn't for me, she would have been long gone. 

She vent all the negativity on me every single day. I moved out my parents house at the age of 24. But things did not go better, my mum would shout at me and curse me when I call them. After I moved out, I only go home once a year and call them once a year. My mother said to me that I am such a cold hearted person, she craved for my emotional intimacy. 

My childhood memory, all I can remember is that my mum used to curse me all the time and ask me to go kill myself, and yet she says she loves me. I used to cut myself with a knife, and bang my head against the wall when I felt miserable. That's my childhood. 

My mother was abused by my grandmother, that's what made her who she is. 

These past 2 years, I have been searching for the meaning of life. I rather die of cancer and give my life to someone else. Eventually, I reconciled with my mother, I have forgiven her, as she did not know what she was doing. I pity her that she was abused by my grandmother. So I have forgiven her. But... 

But I still struggle with this implication of parental rejection. As an adult, my self esteem is very low, I have zero confidence. 

All my romantic relationships have failed. My partners all left me. I am a people pleaser, I invest so much in each relationship and they all abandoned me just like my mother did. I did not have mother's love, that's why it destroyed me every single time when my partner abandon me. 

My mother used to say to me that I would never find happiness in my life, I would suffer like she did, because my father doesn't love her. She said no men would ever love me. I have been seaching for love and my lovers all left me. 

When I compare myself with my ex partners' current girlfriends, I feel so much pain, those girls are positive, optimist, have loving parents. 

Me? I am nothing, a pathetic loser. Of course no one would love me. I am crying now writing this. Every day is the same, I don't want to keep living, but I don't have the courage to kill myself. I don't know what's the meaning of my life. 

If I had a loving mother, I would turn out to be so much different person now, I would have a different life by now I am sure of it. 

Even though I have forgiven my mother, but the pain doesn't go away easily when everything in my life sucks, partner left me. 

I have went to psychologist, but didn't help much. Thank you for reading my post. I wish I could get a hug, I haven't been hugged by someone for 2 years now. I feel so lonely and lost."
depression,Is there anything that could help with the numbness part of depression ?,"Depression manifests as a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of energy, anxiety ,negative thinking, emotional numbness, loss of motivation...etc  


So far I found many ways to manage the symptoms of depression but I didn't find anything that helped with the numbness part where you just don't feel anything or care about anything at all nothing makes you happy, sad, cry, your mood is just flat all the time   


I wasn't always like this I was a normal person with hobbies,  ambitions and goals but I developed this condition this year and it stripped me of everything. I lost all feelings for my gf I lost all drive for my dreams, they mattered nothing. I had a blank mind I couldn't socialize I kinda stopped contacts with family and friends basically I lost everything that made meaning in my life. It's impossible/meaningless to live in this condition.  


The numbness part is so common with clinical depression ( not depression feeling because of a bad day ) and I saw many posts on reddit that I could relate with so I know that I'm not alone suffering from this condition so anyone has this symptom found anything that could help with it ?"

Sorry for the rambling I’m just having an especially hard morning."
depression,Why are we forced to live?,"If you dont want to live youre forced either way. You will be treated worse than a criminal, forcefully drugged, tortured in mental facilities, until you ""behave"". 

Escape is made extra hard. But for what? Just to suffer?"
depression,I feel like nobody will truly ever understand,And that’s okay. Everyday is a struggle. I have a good job and good people I surround myself with. But there is a void in my life. My moods are up and down. One minute I’m happy the next I’m crying in a pillow over something that happened years ago. Trauma is no joke.i learned that no one actually cares. Most people get annoyed and shrug the conversation off first chance they get. I find writing about it on here is cathartic.

depression,My brother is depressed and I would like some advises on how to help him.,"My one and only brother is depressed. He has seen a doctor and has been hospitalised due to depression in the past. His wife and kid left him (he hasn’t told me or my parents how it happened and about the current situation he has with his kid) a few years back. I live in Europe and he lives in Japan. Due to COVID it is impossible for me to visit Japan and before COVID when I visited my parents two years ago, I could not get a chance to see him so it has been three or four years since I saw him last. 
We used to be really close when we were young but we are now a bit distant from each other. I am worried about him constantly and I call and text him but he is not really responding. I send cards and some small gifts, too, just so that he knows I am thinking about him. Whenever he responds, he rarely mentions about what is going on with his mind and his life. I always make sure that he knows he can always talk to me. I am scared if I get a call from my parents one day, telling me that he committed suicide (I don’t even know if he is suicidal though). I have another friend who is dealing with depression and he kindly offered his number to give to my brother so he has at least someone, who has gone through the same things, to talk to. I know that each case is different and I painfully know that he is going through unimaginably tough things that I can comprehend but I want to contribute something to prevent something bad happening from him. If anybody can give me any advices, I am all ears. Thank you for listening/reading this."
depression,Depressed bf in LDR,"Just like the title says, my boyfriend of 2+ has depression and has been struggling with it for years along with suicidal thoughts and I’m struggling to help him through is all especially while being long distance. 
If anyone has any advice on how I can be there for him and help him more I would highly highly appreciate it"
depression,Talking into the void,"I just need to get this out and have at least one pair of human eyes read my words. I’m so fucking miserable. My exams are next week and I literally can’t study. Everything feels pointless. I’m trapped. I tried to book an appointment and they’re booked out for weeks. I can’t keep doing this. Every day begins and ends and there’s no escape. I can’t even end it as much as I want to because I know it would hurt the people I love and no one deserves to be traumatised by finding the body.

Am I just supposed to live like this? How does anyone live like this?? I would give anything to stop feeling this way."
depression,Writing a letter to depression as if it is a real person,"Hey! I wrote a post like this before and received wonderful replies so I am doing it again!

Basically I was advised to write a letter to my mental illness as if it were a real person. I found it helped me, both writing to it and reading my family's letters to my mental illness.

So I started a project where I collect and publish people's ‘Letters to their mental illness’ where anybody can post letters to their illness, from eating disorders, bipolar, agoraphobia, depression, OCD etc. Alternatively you could write to a loved one about the illness. It’s all anonymous of course. The aim is to share the letters and read other people's letters and hopefully it will make us feel less alone!

I would love a letter from anybody here who would like to take part! Thank you for reading this!

Here is the website for anybody interested :) [https://www.letterstomymind.com/](https://www.letterstomymind.com/)"
depression,"Need advice on Lexapro, mirtazapine, and Wellbutrin","Hey! So I was on lexapro for a year and a bit till it sorta stopped working for me. 

Before lexapro I had pristiq, lovan, Prozac with these meds I noticed an immediate improvement in mood each time but they all ended up making me more depressed after 6 months, the same happened with lexapro but then it got paired with mirtazapine and it was fine for a bit more. 

Until my anxiety had a massive spike and I got taken off it and put on valdoxan which didn’t work and am now on Wellbutrin and mitazapine and it’s the worst I’ve felt over all and I’m probably gonna go back to lexapro and mirtazapine but not super keen on the sexual side effects again.

I’m wondering if anyone else has been through this cycle and found something that works and what it was? 

At the moment my anxiety is ridiculous and I can’t sleep and my emotions are all over the place and I just want something that works"
depression,[TW] The only real comfort,"On my worst days, there is nothing that calms me more than knowing that I could end it. When nothing has worked out in years, when my heart is racing so fast it physically hurts, when I know everyone hates me, when I realize my life will always be like this, my comfort lies in lying down in a dark room, closing my eyes and picturing how I would kill myself. It will be quick, a few moments of pain and then there will never be any pain ever again. I just want it all to end."
depression,I have no one to call my therapist is booked for a whole month and forgot to schedule me.,"It’s not a suicidal thing I’m just really struggling and I need to talk about it but I don’t want to call the suicide hotline I’m not “at risk” even if I am it’s not like that at the moment I’m trying to prevent getting to that point. Compass said if I make a ‘Crisis’ call/appointment I’m going to be hospitalized as a precaution, I guess the upside is by that time I won’t have a job or place to live but hospitals aren’t free I can’t just go stay there like some vacation from life. 

I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do."

depression,I still relive the day my cat passed,"I just want to get this out of my chest because its been holding alot of weight 

I was always emotional * diagonised with bpd* and events happened though-out my life that made me prone to depression. I have been depressed on and off since i was 14 . Last year on January 7th 2020 my 13 year old cat died in my arms. It happened so sudden and i was all alone the whole time she was dying. Since that day i have never been the same emotionally and mentally. I have become more depressed then usual and i cant let go. 
I miss her so much it pains me."
depression,I can't be bothered eating lately,"The closest to a proper meal I made was the other day and it was two mushrooms and two eggs..  Exciting right lol.  


Lately I just cannot be bothered eating. I have a morning cup of coffee.  And if I get hungry sometimes I have another one.  It'll hit 9om before I even think about food.  Sometimes my stomach growls but I just can't be bothered eating anyway.  

I've lost a little weight and I'm not really looking very well atm.  Some people from work seem to notice. How can I appear healthy and like I'm taking care of myself when I'm not?"
depression,Does venting help much?,"It just seems to me that didn't help that much, just a couple of hours totally wasted, because the other person tried to be nice for once in their life and if you keep going on venting they get tired of us. It might be the thought of ""not being alone"" that we're all scared of. And it's all on internet, because I don't have anyone IRL."
depression,Suicide has never seemed so...Joyful,"Whenever im pushed to the point of suicidal thoughts, im usually an absoloute crying mess. Today is different, the very concept of it seems to be something that fills me with joy. Knowing i will never escape my life's struggles and having the option to end it all fills me with some type of happiness I havent felt in a long time. Its pure joy and even excitment, not for doing it, but rather that it exitsts."
depression,I don't have a future...," 

I am a 15 year old, I cut myself with a sharpener blade. I have been doing this since March. I don't really do it for the pain, its just that seeing the beads of blood makes me feel calm whenever I'm angry or depressed. But I don't know how long this is going to go on. I'm worried. Also, I don't really have a passion. So I don't know what am I going to pursue in the future either. I just feel so done.

P.S.-Forgive me for my English, it is not my native language."
depression,I’m ready to go,"When I kill myself tonight I’m going to think about everyone who tried to make me into a better guy. Anyone who tried to help me. I’m sorry to my friends, I’m sorry to my parents, I’m sorry to my teachers and I’m sorry to my therapists. But I can’t go on. I’m so fucking sad and I’ve been this way for years. I’m helpless. I’m useless. And I’m scared. So I’m going to save everyone the trouble and kill myself. I feel bad abandoning them all but I can’t stand living anymore. I’m ready to finally kill myself. I hope someone sees this when I’m gone."
depression,Suicidal but not sad,So I’m 12 and I would say I’m kind of suicidal but I’m not really sad most of time it’s more like a “Dying doesn’t sound to shabby rn” or sometimes Earth gets boring. Also whenever I think of a bad situation such as my family dying my first thought is killing myself. Is this depression or am I a psychopath?
depression,Everything's fucking bullshit,I love how i can't even talk about my depression without people saying r/im14andthisisdeep
depression,I’ve become comfortable with being sad and I don’t want to leave this comfort,"Everyday is waking up and knowing there’s nothing I look forward to. I feel like I’m an imposter; I don’t belong in my school program and I definitely feel
like I don’t belong in this category of depressed people because compared to others, I’ve been blessed.

I know we shouldn’t compare whose had it worse, but I just don’t feel like I belong anywhere even when I’m with friends. I want to go home all the time. Even when I’m home, it feels like I’m not home. I’m tired of being high functioning and I just want to curl up into a ball until I know life has something for me. 

I’m only 21. Ive been sad for almost more than half my life. I’ve been sad for so long and now I don’t want to
leave this feeling."

depression,[crowd-sourced] Remind yourself of what you've forgotten!,"After I struggled with depression for a bit, I noticed how some things that some thoughts are just harder to connect with than when you're not depressed. For example, ""it won't always feel like this"" is easier to agree with / believe when you're not so down.

To work around this issue, **I put a note on my phone that reminds me of some of those important thoughts that I tend to forget** when my mood goes sour. So far, I have:

* temporary mood: it won't always feel like this
* stop fortune-telling: you literally don't know the future, so you can't be afraid of / sad about it, just like bad things can surprise you, so can the unexpectedly good

**What other important ideas** / thoughts would you add to this, to short-circuit the vicious circle?"

depression,worsening dysfunction,"just to preface, im 21 and ive been struggling with depression/other mood disorders for most of my life. this year started out horribly for me and i still have not moved past the emotional state i was in in january. it's may now and i've realized that every time i get in these frequent deep depressive moods i convince myself im going to end my life. doing this is the only thing that calms me down and makes me feel better about my life and situation. but because ive convinced myself im not gonna be alive soon, ive effectively gotten nothing done at all this year. i stopped participating in college classes, i put off everything, and i keep excessively spending money. 

ive gone through therapy before, multiple times. each time i just feel less and less like its working. at this point i've given up on myself and i cant find the will to keep trying to get better. i guess it would be nice if i knew other people can relate to dysfunction thing at least? planning to end my life on multiple occasions this year alone has seriously distorted pretty much everything"
depression,Achieving your goals doesn't mean shit to depression,"I hated the way I looked and was fat for all of my adolescence so I lost weight, did ab workouts and got the body I wanted.   
    
I wanted to go to a good college so I studied hard and got a 1540 on the SAT.   
    
I felt like I was treating my mom poorly so I made an effort to spend more quality time with her and be nicer to her.   
   
But still, every fucking day I think about how much I hate life and how much I want it to end as soon as possible. Even though I've done things I thought would make me happy, I am still the same unmotivated, unconfident piece of shit I was 4 months ago. I don't know if anything will ever make me a functional, happy person. For the most part I have stopped giving a shit about school and sleep, I'm failing like 6 classes right now and I have a flat out 0 in 4 of those classes A WHOLE MONTH into the marking period. The stress and anxiety are killing me. The more my problems grow, the more the stress, anxiety, and vices grow. The more the stress, anxiety and vices grow, the more my problems go. It's like some fucked up mutualistic relationship. I'm only 16 and I still have so much to learn about life so I'll trudge through it for now but I still have a fucked up brain living in fucked up conditions and it's all my fault."
depression,I can’t understand why,"Hi there, I’m 17F and I need some help. I don’t understand why I need the help because I have the perfect relationship, perfect job and o don’t really have any issues with my life but I constantly feel down and at loss of motivation. The thought of scuicide passes through my mind almost daily... I’m at a loss of what’s wrong with me or what could make me feel this way..."
depression,These past five months I've been basically building up the courage to kill myself...,"I was suicidal in December now its may and a lot of shits happend in April. Everyday has been fucking terrible since the 6th. If it wasn't for the stuff on valentine's day we'd still be fine maybe. All I have to blame is myself, I tried blaming it on ""higher forces"" like demons n stuff but eventually turned to alcohol and pot to suppress how I've felt. It's only gotten worse and I'm afraid one day I'll be fed up and be done. I've been suicidal before all this but fuel has been added that makes me feel it even more. I'm scared, alone, confused, and tired. I wish I could have the one friend back who actually made me happy but now he wants nothing to do with me but I dont blame him. This is karma for shit I've done in my past life. I was feeling pretty good last week but I felt I didn't even deserve to feel that way. Idk its 4 am I need to sleep and not obsesse over dumb shit so goodnight."

depression,Feeling," **CW???? Mentions of Offing themselves and Self hatred**

Everyday is the same wake up, get ready for online school, sit in a class I don't even listen to, after class go back to bed for a couple hours then stay up half the night. Again. And again over and over and over until someday maybe I'll realize its not worth it. It's not worth living another day. Breathing the same air as the ones above me, better than me. Lives worth more than mine . I'm just a mistake its my fault for being a burden for not having the motivation to clean my room, for not being happy all the time, for making my family worry about me not being ""the same happy little **GIRL** you used to be"". Maybe one day I'll act on those feelings, get tired of the voices in my head telling me to just end it all, get tired of feeling like everyone is laughing at me, making fun of me, get tired of not being a **NORMAL** happy **GIRL**....

Yeah but not today... Maybe tomorrow

I went to a couple different places over a period of several months. I explained everything and that said it could be stress. 

Currently I'm working and staying active. My appetite is fine, sleep is tough at times, I get vivid dreams more often now, and I find I'm less interested in being social than I used to be.

depression,Fake it 'til you make it? Chronic depression and sex drive,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

It's my first post, so go easy on me!

I have chronic depression and anxiety. I was first diagnosed at age 12 and I am almost 34 now. I have been on and off meds since then, but have been very much on them for the last decade. In my case, it is both chemical imbalance (runs very deep in my family!)  and situational (bullied daily at school from about age 9 through to graduating + toxic relationship with my single mother). 

 I have been on tons of different meds and have been to countless therapists, but therapy and CBT have never really worked for me despite being a completely open book and willing guinea pig! I have also received in-patient treatment without any long-term success. 

At the moment, I am on Effexor 225mg and I have Pax to take when needed. I tried to come off my medication a couple of years ago but I couldn't even talk without breaking down in tears. I was disappointed because I had never thought I would have to be on medication probably forever. But I have more-or-less come to accept that this might just be what's necessary to keep me stable. It sucks, it's expensive....and it's KILLED my libido. 

I have never really been a super sexual person in the first place (my love language is cuddling and watching series) but it is now completely gone. This could be the depression, but I suspect the meds are playing a huge role. But I also can't come off them because I have exhausted my options (I live in South Africa and we don't have all the same treatment options available). I am also engaged to the most amazing person in the world and I am terrified because I know that a healthy sex life is crucial in a healthy relationship. But I am never horny. And while I do have sex with him maybe once a week, I know that, while he is being incredibly supportive, that his needs aren't being met. 

What can I do in this situation? Any hacks for faking yourself into a state of arousal?"
depression,Idk what I’m doin here,"You ever just take a step back and look at yourself and think “I’m such a piece of shit”... idk why I’m writing here I can’t think straight, I just need a sharper knife, idk I just feel like no matter what I do I’m gonna lose everything and I feel like I bring no value to anyone, like I’m just a walking corpse I can’t even hold a fucking conversation anymore"
depression,hopeless,[removed]
depression,Is it normal to feel nauseous when you’re sad?,"I get really bad waves of sadness throughout the day, especially at nighttime, and I get extremely nauseous and physically ill. Sometimes I throw up and just end up staying awake because of how sad and anxious I am. Is that normal? Or should I tell my doctor in my next appointment?"
depression,"It’s like people can’t even look at me, and are avoiding talking to me.","I’m deeply depressed. I’m at the point where I’m crying all the time and can’t sleep ever. I have had some suppressed trauma memories come up and I can’t live with them. I feel so numb most the time I don’t feel like eating, and normally I’m the kind of person that eats when I’m upset. I’m numb. Suicidal. I keep trying to talk to people about how much I hate being in my own skin and that I want to die so these thoughts aren’t trapped in my head. I need to say them, I don’t want them to take over and be true. Yet when I say them every one of my close friends get this gross look on their face and they try to change the subject. I can tell they can’t handle what I am going through. They don’t know what to say. I have a therapist, she’s okay. I feel like no one believes me and like I’m faking how much I wish I could just end it without hurting anyone right now. I just know if I ended it people would have to live with guilt thinking they caused it by not saying “the right things” and I don’t want to give people that feeling."
depression,Why shouldn't I give in?,"If everything is hopeless, why should I try to do anything better? ""Because it's not hopeless"" yeah, it's really hard to make anyone understand this but, I tried to change, I wanted to change for years but nothing happened because I fail everything. Just, think for a second, if for my whole life, for 23 years, I didn't succeed şn a single simplest thing, why would it suddenly change? Wouldn't it be magical?

And then there's me, I am being lazy all day, every day. People say that it's because of depression, but this depression isn't going away. I just don't want to do something that will be hard for me. Like, idk working out, cleaning my room, helping with anything... Nobody really wants to do that but people does that, I don't, generally. So, again, it's expected from me to not to achieve anything.

And I know that everything is hopeless, you might say that it's feeding this situation but I see this as another reason why everything is hopeless, because my thoughts are feeding it.

I am thinking of, giving up on therapy. Because my problems are real, not in my head. I mean for example, I don't know anything and I don't have any skills and I am broke, and I can't live with my parents anymore. Think for a second, what can they do? They could encourage me to finish school but it will take me 4 years, yeah it's too late. They could encourage me to work in a minimum wage job (which, I can not because of a lot of reasons, I ruin everything, I can't literally talk to anybody), minimum wage will not cover my therapy, a healthy diet and lessons to improve myself. So here, I am having a real problem and it's making me depressed. I might talk about my feelings, I might use medicine but, I will still be broke. So this real problem persists, so, I don't know maybe I will magically be happy but... You see it right. This is just an example ny the way there are a lot of real problems I have which can not be solved with therapy.

I was trying to lose weight and work on my junk food addiction. I am thinking of you giving up now. I wasn't eating junk food but I guess I will just go and eat what I want to eat today. Because FUCK EVERYTHING!

Why am I working at all? Therapy, diet fuck them all I am hopeless and I am giving up!"
depression,Just relapsed on self harm for the first time in years,"Amazing how just a little house key can rip off a decent amount of skin, although to be fair I haven't really been eating much and I've lost so much weight following a breakup in December. This ugly, pasty white skin is much easier to break because of that I would imagine.

Good thing my job site has a first aid kit so I can just lie and say I fell/scraped myself on something."
depression,Am i depressed?,"im 15 and i ask myself am i even actually depressed? i cant afford therapy and my family does not believe in mental health. When i search up online i can mostly relate to almost all of the symptoms. When i tried to talk to someone its people just saying i am being dramatic. I am miserable all the time, i feel worthless and constantly consider the possibility like ""how happy would everybody be if i was just dead"". I have become so lazy over time and have no interest in anything. I am always told by pretty much everyone around me especially my parent like ""you are a curse and we wish you would just kill yourself or just die"" and honestly i too wish that i too wish i was dead because i know that i am too much of a coward to actually do it but i know that i just would be better of dead."
depression,Guilt from taking time off work,Had an especially rough night and now I have to be up for work in 3 hours. I'm lucky enough that I get a couple paid leave days but I feel guilty about using them. I've only ever used it once for a family issue which helped me validate it but now I'm dreading writing the email to my supervisor and contemplating going to work mentally exhausted. I feel like there could be stigma around mental health especially since I work with a lot of older people who I feel will judge me as a young professional. I hate the idea of being seen as making excuses or my depression not being a valid reason for calling out of work.
depression,"I feel guilty:,)",I hate how my parents won't accept me for what i do but it makes me happy like idk what to care for bc i end up putting them first
depression,Made the mistake of looking through my past IG posts and it just reminded me of all the friends I’ve pushed away,"I used to have SUCH an amazing friend circle. We did so many fun things. I looked back through my feed and was reminded of themed parties, silly drunken nights, soooo many evenings spent laughing. 

Thennn depression hit. I didn’t recognize it for what it was so I didn’t seek help. It turned me into such a grouchy, irritable mess. I never wanted to hang out with anyone. I would sometimes try just so I didn’t lose my friends but they could sense I didn’t want to be there. 

I moved away to a different state. Haven’t spoken to any of them in two years. Finally got myself the help I needed all along and am out of the fog enough to realize how fucking lonely I am and just what I gave up. 

There is no chance of reconciliation. Zero. Even if there was, I live eight hours away now. 

I have no friends here. I know I need to rebuild a friend group but at this point in a different state in a different city starting completely from scratch, I’m lost. I don’t know how. I’m not a very social person. 

What a mess I’ve made."
depression,Feeling exhausted and stressed,"Over the past few years, I’ve gotten a lot better handle on my negative emotions and don’t let it affect my actions towards other people. But today, I lost control of my temper and was being kind of abrasive towards my online friends, and now I feel like crap. 

I guess it doesn’t help that my life has been so stressful lately. I have been having terrible thoughts again about wishing my existence ceased to exist. It’s not that I actively wish to harm myself. I just want a break from life for just one second."

I’m a failure. I’m sorry Rachael. I really let you down. And it feels like I’m always going to be letting you down. I think you were right. I am a coward. I loved you. Even then, I loved you. And yeah, things were bad, but looking back, they weren’t bad because we were bad, they were bad because you were in a fight that you needed my help to win. And I was scared that I wasn’t good enough to win that fight, or that I couldn’t help. And I didn’t listen to you when you told me I was wrong.

Now you’re dead. And I won’t ever get to apologize for how I failed you.

depression,Give me a reason to keep going,"I’m turning 22 tomorrow. Male. 
I’ve been dealing with insane mental issues and quite frankly I just can’t do this bullshit anymore. 
I have nobody in my life that can and will ever understand. Those expectations have been long gone. I’ve been isolating myself for months, closer to years. I’ve lost an insane amount of weight. My hair is long as fuck and makes me look like a crazy delusional piece of shit. I can’t take care of myself because of the shit I deal with mentally from the second I wake up every day. 

I just had what any happy person what call an insanely fun weekend. Took my dad golfing for his birthday on friday, got drunk as fuck that night, went longboarding saturday morning, and went and DJ’d at my little sisters high school prom Saturday night. But the thing is, i did not enjoy any of it. It was all fake, fake smiles, fake laughter, fake conversations. By the time sunday rolled around I thought i had actually lost my god damn mind because of how hard i was trying not to let everyone down. 

I just now took a video of myself in my room, shirtless just to see how I looked to other people. Have you ever just cringed so hard at the sight of yourself? Months of weightloss and psychotic depression. Idek who the fuck i am right now. 

Now i get to wake up tomorrow and go to work for 10 hours at this shitty fucking job having to get told what to do all day by some dickhead boss... for my birthday, my only wish is to not wake up the following day."
depression,so close to taking my own life last night,"as the caption said so, I almost did. I’m overwhelmed by so much insecurities. I unable to process and handle the blames that my sis throws. It’s been six months from mum’s passing, about three months from dad’s passing, but I just lie to myself that they are just staying abroad because I can’t face the truth. It’s too much for me to handle. 

It has came to a point that crying doesn’t help anymore. I don’t exactly have a sounding board anymore either. And I don’t blame the person, it’s not their fault. Trust getting rebuild, surely there’s bound to have lines that can’t be overstepped. 

It’s so much easier to lie that I’m doing fine. But I’m not. I don’t wish to reveal it so much that I’ll be told off for seeking attention.

depression,Some words for YOU,"Hello,

I don't know how to tell it, but i don't want you guys give up, i know how it feels, when your head, your heart is inhabited  by the worst feelings,  a feeling of living in hell,  having lost hope of seeing the light, But you need to keep fightning, keeping the hope to get out of that, to get better, to be healthy.

Don't hesitate to talk with people how you feel, i know sometimes the words can't help, but sometimes it can, and people can help you to feel better. It's important to avoid isolating yourself, especially in these times of pandemics where people may not be doing well mentally. 

I hope you guys will get better soon! 

Thanks for reading, keep healthy,

Luv ♥"
depression,Is it normal to not have a reason to live besides your loved ones?,I'm asking this question to all the non depressed people on the sub. I feel as if everyone I loved forgot me or died id simply have litterally 0 reason to live.
depression,Feeling alone more than ever,I usually annoy my bestie all the time because I don't have anyone else to talk to but lately he's been sleeping a lot and is barely around. I feel more alone than ever and am stuck with myself and how utterly empty and boring I am. I don't enjoy anything I do anymore and it feels like I'm doing it to fill the void but I don't feel any different no matter what I'm doing or who I'm with. Talking to people online isn't helping either so idk what to do.
depression,No one owes us anything.,[removed]
depression,Should I quit for mental health reasons,"I read a recent reddit post on a career subreddit about ""Sunday Blues"" and I understand it's a common feeling for employees. Same thing for me but in my case, I am thinking of quitting my job once and for all despite my efforts to enjoy my weekends off. I enjoy my weekends so much with my family and friends but when the Monday shift is hours away, my stomach is churning and I feel like choking for air. I struggle to get up and move because I just keep crying.

For context, my job mismatches with my degree. I don't love what I'm doing and it's starting to feel repetitive. The coworkers are toxic and the company management itself is a mess. But the biggest thing here is really, I feel major anxiety hours before work on a Monday because I feel stuck in a loop to just get the week over with. I feel helpless that I can't do anything to stop Monday from coming. I have this looming thought that I'm wasting my life and potentials here.

I feel like I should quit for mental health reasons; take a break, and focus on getting better... 

I mean, should I? I have savings but it's so difficult to find work nowadays. And how would I pay for therapy? Is that enough? But I just feel so miserable and I feel like each week I'm just dragging myself to survive. If I quit for mental health reasons, will it be worth it? 

Should I quit?"
depression,I feel broken,"Today, i went out in my garden, where most of my childhood happened, as soon as I went outside, memories rushed in, i cried for what feels like hours, i reallised, that who i was is no more, im just a husk of the happy kid i used to be. I have difficulty at school and I basically have given up already, i feel like im a broken glass getting sweeled up and thrown in the trash, I don't know if i want to live like this anymore."
depression,A tale in depression,"I have been battling with depression since I was around 9 years old. That feeling of desperation and being at a constant dead-end came to govern my life until I eventually became a shell of myself.

I want to share with you the things that helped me win my life back.

Depression is a scary and unpredictable beast. You never know when it will strike and you never know how it will strike. And most important of all, you never know the root of the problem. It may be a problematic family, a failed relationship, the loss of a loved one. Anything can contribute. It is important to understand what feeds it, so you can move away from it. And once you do find out what is that feeds it, you should run away from it as fast as you can. Doesn't matter if it is a loved one, if it is your family or the job you spent so many years trying to get.
Nothing and I mean NOTHING, is more important than your mental health. No releationship, no house, no family and no job. Sometimes it is difficult to see things clearly and identify what you have to run aeay from. That's when a therapist should be consulted.
I believe that seeking professional help is the best thing you can do.

Once you move away from the root of the problem, you should try to make ammends with the past. What happened, happened. You cannot change it. Pining over it has no use. You have to accept it. Accept that this is you now. Everything that has happened has contributed to you being here now. And from here you should strive to be a better version of your self. Build your life. Take some hobbies. Help others in need. Even if you feel like you cannot even help yourself, you can always help others. And helping can be something as trivial as just calling someome to know how they are doing. Think of the small things that would make your own day and practice them on others. Be the change you want to see in others. It's a chain reaction and it ALWAYS comes back to you.

Do not be ashamed to ask for help. Nothing makes a human being happier than helping one in need. Bear that in mind and know that people around you will be glad to help you.

Do the things that scare you. Go out. Go for a walk. Call a friend that you haven't spoke to in years. Do not feel guilty about having a good time. This is the thing about depression that you should always keep in mind: It makes you afraid of everything that could help you win your life back. When on doubt, think of that.

If you ever feel like ending it all just take comfort in the fact that everything is temporary. Call a friend and talk about it. You will see how much they care about you. How much they value your life. Chances are they couldn't even imagine what you are going through.

We live on borrowed time. So make the most of it. Make sure that you leave this place better than you found it when you first arrived. Touch people. Help them. Strive to right your wrongs. Tip the balance of the scale that governs this world to the good side.
 
And the most important thing of all: Tell your self daily that you love him. Talk to him. Loudly so you can hear him. Tell how much he means to you. The little things that you are proud of. Even being here despite all the pain, is somethimg you should be proud of. Even if at the begining you don't believe it, it is important that you never stop telling yourself how much he means to you. The most difficult thing when you are down, is not to get up. Is to stop pushing yourself lower.

Always remember: Be kind. Take joy in your actions rather than the reward that might come from them.

Let the shadow pass and the sun shall shine the brightest."
depression,Lack of social life and confinement is making me genuinely feel depressed,"So I should start off by saying i do not have depression at least i havent been diagnosed in with it. However I would say I have been developing more symptoms throughout this pandemic mostly due to feeling like my life sucks and nothing has meaning (in the grand scheme of things) 

I wanted to know how people combat such feeling in this context? I've recently just been crying out of nowhere when I think about how pathetic my life seems to be (I only have a handful of friends, 2 of which i contact regularly via messenger + I am mostly in my room either studying or just existing I suppose). I even woke up one night crying all of a sudden. 

I am not claiming to have depression but feeling this way is making me upset and I dont know how to improve my situation when I am demotivated to and there isnt much to do given the circumstances. 

Any advice? 

(If anyone has a more appropriate forum to direct me to please do. I simply just want advice on my out of the ordinary behaviour which has been triggered given the current situation) 

Thanks in advance"
depression,my family looks so good on the outside,"but on the inside its fucked up. addiction, dependence, depression, anxiety. i wish i could be there for my family members but i just shut down whenever the issues are raised. i feel so bad, i should be a better son."
depression,Overheard conversation,"We got thin walls. Heard my roommate and his friend (also my pledge brother) talking about me... roommate didn’t say much or have much enthusiasm but agreed with his buddy’s statements. The one that really hurt was “he has opinions, but they’re shitty opinions”"
depression,Suicide,I am going to kill myself. There's not much convincing you guys can do. I'm just waiting until I can live alone to do so. I know there's good in this world because I've seen it but I can't do much to feel it. Life as I know it is miserable. I'm sorry that I had to live in the first place and I'm sorry to the people who cared for me but I'm quite relieved now that the conclusion to my life is now in sight. I'm somehow both happy and sad. Please don't reach out to me. I'm tired.
depression,I want to cry,what is wrong with me? seriously
depression,I’m finally going to tell someone I attempted suicide a year ago,"A year ago May I attempted suicide and it’s been eating me alive ever since and I just can’t keep it a secret anymore. So today I have therapy and I’m going to tell my therapist. I’ve kept it a secret way too long and my depression has gotten worse again that the same feelings are creeping back into my everyday and I don’t want that to happen again. 

But there’s this overwhelming feeling that I know everything will change once I tell someone and that scares me. Makes me feel like I’m being selfish. When really I just need someone to know and I need to take a break from work and life and stop running from my actions.

So I guess I just need some support that I’m doing the right thing? I’m not even sure. I haven’t felt emotions in a couple months so I’m not sure if I’m making the right decision or not because I honestly can’t feel if it is or not. But anyways here we go. Happy Monday."
depression,"Hate my life, so lonely, so confused","I am 39M, maybe MtF, and I am divorced, I am sexually repressed. I want to date but everytime I see a woman I may be interested in, I just think of all the things she wouldn't like about me.

I don't know what to do, I am over weight and confused as to my gender and I don't have any hobbies or interests except watching tv.

Life is shit"
depression,It feels like i'm slowly rotting from inside,"And then the fact that the world is such shitty place and the continous abuse of people and animals etc.
Doesn't make me feel any better.
Then the fact that most people refuse to see the fact that how badly earth and it's life is doing."
depression,I feel Leonard,"I'd say spoiler alert but, let me be honest.. if you are browsing this sub you don't give a fuck. 

Yesterday, I was (re) watching the very first episode of The Big Bang Theory. There is a scene where Sheldon tells Leonard to stop chasing the woman who had recently moved in the apartment across the hall to which he replies something like ""sure, I'll focus on my work, win a Nobel Prize and die alone"". I laughed at the time since I was watching it alongside my sister, but boy did it get me. I'm at a point where I can't watch any show or movie without feeling upset. Sure, I get happy when people get along but at the same time I get reminded of the fact that what Leonard said is my life, minus the Nobel Prize. Share this with someone and they come back with don't loose hope, but in my experience and to quote Red,  ""hope is a dangerous thing"". I wish I were a machine devoid of any emotions, I'd serve my purpose and become obsolete with time without ever complaining."

depression,Loneliness,People who feel lonely please do understand that there are tons of people just like you waiting to seek attention and you might be the one by destiny to help them
depression,no title,"Hello. Hope everyone is finding ways to manage. I don't know if anyone will read this and its ok if no one does. I wish to anonymously share a few things that has been on my mind for a while, no filter. Might feel better if I do, or not, I don't know, either way I'll find out.

I'm a terrible human being. Not in the pity me sense. Don't feel sorry for me. You don't know me. I have said and done things all my life that have led to friendships ending and even death. Always, without fault at the wrong times. Imagine losing a pet or someone you love and knowing the person that caused it is still alive. That's me. When my character was tested, I became what I really am. A pathetic, narcisstic, nagging, overbearing and inconsiderate coward &amp; liar. Instead of reducing conflict I become even more spiteful. I don't even understand how I get into that mindset which is so habitual and destructive. Everytime I go through old texts, I notice it.

Knowing what is wrong should lead to change, yet here I am, still at a  mental plateau. Years of therapy and plans later I'm still the person I pretend I am not.  That 16 year old cunt who is so insecure and pretentious it's abominable. ""First step is to be more positive about yourself"". No, I've tried. I've fucking tried.
How can I force myself to give up alcohol and coffee but not these behaviours. 

CBT hasn't worked. Nothing has. I'm tired of the same old routine everytime I go to a new doc. I'm tired of knowing what needs to be done and failing again and again. I love learning the science behind mental health but knowing is not working anymore. I hate knowing what needs to change, what I want to change and still failing, still procrastinating, still stuck to that attitude that has failed me.

I'm really struggling to focus at work, I doubt myself every moment and taking leave has not helped. I hate not working because if I'm not thinking of the hurt I've caused, I'm doing everything slowly, too slowly, listening to music, browsing YT endlessly for no reason. I hate these fucking cycles, I hate thinking about jumping off every balcony and railing, I hate not feeling much more than hate anger, and guilt. I hate thinking I'm even considered depressed when I'm still somewhat functional and haven't cried for years. I use to cry weekly till I was sixteen but that's because I always said the opposite of what I wanted to say. 

Don't get me wrong, I really want to be a better person, I want to be geninuely appreciative, respectful and good hearted. I want to feel different, I want to change but now, in my mid twenties I still haven't figured out how and I'm tired, lost and ranting here as if it would change anything. I'm really out of options and I don't know, I'll finish it here. Once again, thanks for reading this shit that won't make you feel better if you did. I regret writing this. Tempted to delete it all right now. Will probably do so tomorrow or in a few minutes. I'm still feeling the conviction to publish it now and will do so."
depression,Why do I exist?,"I'm feeling so low I'm struggling to fathom why would any God enthrust me into existence with such perceived misery and apathy, unless the God is cruel by nature.

Even if there is some higher meaning of suffering, it doesn't relegate the perceived mental torture I have to endure from the moment I regain consiousness in the morning, to the early morning the next day when I'm blessed to fall asleep for a few hours, just to suffer in dreams in vivid, haunting, bizzare nightmares the horror of which transcends into vigil state in the morning when I wake up.

I feel hopeless and useless and angry I have to endure being alive, just to die along the way. One could argue I have friends and family and overall a good life, but that is to no value to me. I feel ashamed and hate myself for not being able to be a person I want, others want me to be, a happy, functioning human being one can be proud of. Instead I'm just lying in my bed and feel no evergy nor will to even get up, eat, brush me teeth.

I just really wish for this horror to end soon. I don't know what I've done to deserve this, but I don't feel I can handle this much longer. It would have been better for me and for everyone that I just die, instead of being sad, negative, broken liability that is not living, just happening to be alive.

Sorry for the loss of time if any of you happened to read this sad cry."
depression,they say that you can only truly understand the depression mindset if you've experienced it but,"i just don't know how to feel right now, i feel so so so lonely i don't think i've ever felt this alone in my entire life. i desperately want someone to be with me and understand me but at the same time if they were to truly understand what i felt like, then it might mean that they've gone through something similar, and it would break my heart even more to know that someone near me would've also suffered or felt like this.   
every night i'm just scared that my crying won't be able to stop and then it'll mean i won't be able to sleep so my thoughts will just keep going. i don't even know if i want to be happy anymore because sometimes it honestly just looks so damn exhausting. i can't even remember how i got to this point anymore. i'm so sorry to my parents and siblings and friends for treating your love as a burden that i'm obligated to keep carrying. sorry for not appreciating you as much as i should. i probably love you more than what i'm capable of loving right now.

everyone on this sub.. honestly i don't even know what to say but i fucking love u all okay. lol so i still dunno what to say but i hope slightly less sad days are coming everyones way. thank u all for existing so that i feel a bit less alone, but it breaks my heart so much that so many other people out there are going through this shitty disorder.. u guys better recover quickly okay hahash love u"

depression,I can’t focus on anything,"I’m 16 and I have depression. I’m constantly distracted. I can’t even sit down and watch a fucking YouTube video without feeling like shit. I don’t feel many emotions anymore. The only way I feel emotions and can focus on anything is through music. My schoolwork is so difficult to even have energy for and I’m completely failing my history class. I’m at least getting my college classes done, but only because I’m forced to. I don’t have any friends and I don’t really feel like being with my family. I just want to lay down in my bed and do nothing. I feel exhausted all the time and I feel hopeless. I want to be a nurse when I’m older but recently I’ve been feeling like I’m not going to do anything with my life. I’m not really down about how I look or anything, I just hate myself as a person. I’m crying typing this out. I feel like I don’t relate to anyone else and that I have no one to talk to."
depression,Depressed when boyfriend leaves for work,"This week I get to spend the week at my boyfriends house. I do this once in a while instead of just weekends. He's a landscaper and now is the busiest of the season. My heart hurts every time he leaves for work. I'm crying right now! 

I'm very proud of him and his hard work, but I can't help but feel lonely though out the day. I've tried using craft of the month kits, but my last project made me cancel the subscription. I tend to use my phone though out the day to keep busy using Facebook, reddit, candy crush and yatzee. 

I also watch TV on demand,  sometimes I use my exercise bike. 

Now I have a mountain bike I haven't had one in years! Once I work out the jitters of riding I'm hoping to go to a park that is 1.4 miles from my boyfriends house. I've been in the area before by walking, I loved how peaceful that area is. But I need to stop being so depressed and live the life I want!"
depression,Going crazy,"I've been depressed for a while but recently I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, maybe due to starting sertraline. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm going crazy I just want to get away from myself, I wish I could push a button and any trace of my existence would be wiped."

Glad for the monotony to break up the silence into little bite-sized pieces. I think of things more clearly then, more logically. I love mornings when they're not sunlit yet. Still, but filled, safe, but not responsible, quiet, but not lonely.                                                                                                      
I think of the way her tears sound and feel guilty. Trouble living is being known, excluding people whom have abandoned hope. They matter, always, but who remembers?                                                                                             
I have learned for the first time in my life how to identify fly eggs before they turn into maggots. They eat and thrive from the moment they hatch, from the moment they're born. Once they are layed, wherever they land, they claim. To be so bold as a maggot, as a fly. Born to die, living to live."
depression,Isn't it weird that I trust strangers more than my friends and family when it comes to talking about my mental problems?,I always keep asking to myself if I really trust them if I can't even tell them about my feelings and emotions.
depression,I want to say thank you,"I made some posts recently and some lovely people reached out to me, they were very kind and yes they were real people, I have connected with one on another platform outside of Reddit and I hope to stay in touch. They listened and chatted when they had no obligation to and they were younger than me ( M 26 ), at their age the average person is not going on depression and suicide discussion subreddits so just wanted to say thank you."
depression,Please help me,"I've been self harm free for about 2 weeks now, but I've got probably the worst urges I've ever had to do it right now, someone please help me stop them"
depression,Admitting I have a problem,"Looking back, maybe I've been depressed for years. I didn't always have a problem with deadlines or concentrating on work, nor was I apathetic or cynical about my future. About the apathy I thought I was just becoming mature, but then I noticed a pattern. I'd start a new project or job with zealous fervor, only to become apathetic and tired and burn out quickly and struggle to meet deadlines. I did wonder if I had ADHD or depression, but I didn't exactly have suicidal thoughts and was still hopeful about my future, so I blamed my laziness and tried to be more diligent. Perhaps growing up in a society where mental illness is still a taboo subject despite its skyrocketing suicide rate didn't help much either. 

Only recently I admitted that I did have a problem, and I learned it in a rather pathetic way. Several months ago I underwent preventive surgery and during the first two months I ate, slept and exercised regularly to speed up the recovery. After the near-death experience I was determined to lead a healthier life and follow my passion of becoming a creator, but while my body was recovering my mind still struggled to focus and I couldn't help feeling guilt and anger at myself for failing to improve my life even after almost dying. To cope with the stress I started eating junk food again, hated myself and starved, then repeated the process. Lately I spend most of my day in bed because sleep is my only escape from thinking about all the stupid choices I made in my life. I can't even play my favorite games or enjoy movies or books anymore because even that takes effort. I've been seeing my friends more often, not to discuss my problems (Though my mother is a medical professional she thinks people with depression are just making excuses for their laziness, so I only opened up about my condition to my siblings. While they were initially supportive, now they're sick and tired of my whining and I don't blame them. I'd rather die than be despised by my friends the same way.) but because forcing myself to meet people is now the only way to motivate myself enough to take a shower, wear something nice, leave the house, act cheerful and agreeable, makes me feel happy, and actually enjoy food. (usually I alternate between ordering delivery food which I often can't finish because I can't digest food well or feel terribly guilty for wasting money on unhealthy food, or just sustain on crackers because I feel too tired to set the table) But it's becoming a financial burden (one of my friends are mean or anything, we just go Dutch) and doesn't really solve anything, so I'm trying hard to stop that. My savings are running out and I'll need to start working again but at the same time I'm afraid of missing another deadline and losing my job, as well as feeling like I'm wasting my life. 

Today I managed to wake up early and showered and fixed myself something half-decent to eat, so that I can take a walk outside and maybe work on my projects. Then my mother went on and on about how I should be getting out more, lose weight and improve myself, yadda yadda. She always does that whenever she sees me but for some reason her nagging(I know she didn't mean to but I took it as such) made me snap. I didn't yell at her or anything, I just felt overwhelmed and suffocated and curled up in bed, wasting another day and hating myself more because I'm so weak. I can't breathe well because it feels like I have a lump in my throat. I keep musing about slashing my throat in the bathroom, because it's the easiest place to clean up after I'm gone. My low energy and motivation is frustrating and sickening, and the apathy is killing me. First it was ""What's the point of writing this novel, nobody will read it."" now it's ""What's the point of living, it'll be just another pitiful day."" Yet at the same time I'm afraid of death, and feeling like such a coward for that. I did manage to make an appointment with a therapist which wasn't easy since there aren't many where I live, but I'll have to wait for a month. If only I can stick by until then."
depression,I can't recover.,"I can't come back.  I can't get my head on right.  I don't feel right anywhere inside my skin, everything hurts.  I'm holding back tears every second of the day and plaster a fake face on to please the crowd.  I'm so tired.  I'm pathetic.  Weak. Stupid. Useless. Worthless. A burden. Too much. Too emotional.  Dramatic.  Self centered.  Wrong wrong WRONG!

Why am I here..."
depression,I feel alone,People leave and die every day and I feel it. People hurt me every day and it cuts deep. I go to the world of my thoughts and hide from it all until my suicidal thoughts flood in and push me out. I try to kill myself to make it stop but it never works. I feel trapped and alone. Drowning in my own self loathing. I can't continue on like this.
depression,self-neglect or just lazy?,"I don't know if this is related to depression but If anyone can relate then great!

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I don't take care of myself well. I never work out. Like ever. I know I should, I get short of breath just by walking up the stairs. I know I should do sports because I'm really unhealthy. I just don't care. I don't have any motivation for it. I also eat pretty unhealthily. I've gained weight and I hate my body because of it but I still don't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't have the energy to brush my teeth, shower or wash my face every night, which I know is bad, but I just do not care. I know it's causing me issues such as cavities in my teeth because I get them easily but I just do not care. I don't know why because I know I should just take care of myself but I don't. I just feel emotionless.

&amp;#x200B;

I acknowledge that what I'm doing is bad for my health but I still don't seem to care enough to do anything about it. I don't know if this is depression though because I've had this for a long time.. Like maybe 2 years now. And I also don't feel sad, I don't cry often, it's more like a feeling of nothing. I do feel happy sometimes but most times it's just a feeling of emptiness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do any of you who have depression struggle with this? Or am I actually just lazy? Because I don't know if I'm depressed because I don't feel sad. I just don't seem to care. It's really hard to get things started, like going to the shower might take me a few hours every night. I don't know why I'm like this.

&amp;#x200B;

(And yes I'm seeing a doctor about my mental health issues, I just haven't been diagnosed with anything yet and want to know if others have similar issues.)"

So im wondering what i should do with my closest ones so i can show how much they mean to me before i go. Or would that make it worse? Since im doing it, i might as well do it right"
depression,I knew somebody who killed himself,"People have told me it is not respectful to talk about this kind of stuff but I disagree and think it is respectful to talk about it. I think they are just trying to avoid acknowledging the issue because people do not like to talk about true depression. I will not mention his name but at work I knew this guy who seemed normal and outgoing to me. He would make jokes a lot and try to make people laugh. And me and him were both sad but neither of us knew the other one was sad. He seemed normal to me like everybody else, he would laugh a bit more than other people and seemed less serious though. And I did not know him well I'd only known him for a few months when one day I saw him looking angry like somebody just yelled at him and he was pissed about it. I had the assumption he was a happy guy who got yelled at one day and was upset for a minute. I was going on my break and I turned around and saw him with a face like he was about to cry and it made me want to talk to him but he also looked upset like he didn't want anybody to talk to him so I left for my break and decided if he was still upset when I got back I would talk to him. Keep in mind I thought he was just a happy guy having a bad day. When I got back from my break he was already gone and I was going to ask him what happened the next time I saw him but I never saw him again after that. A few days later I came into work and a guy told me that he had recently got beat up by some girl's boyfriend because he had a crush on her and then he jumped off of a building and died after that. And, the guy who told me this news surprised me and he didn't even know the guy's full name correctly, he said the name wrong. And later, a girl at work told me the news again and she said she always knew he was depressed which surprised me even more since I didn't know him that well. The person who seemed the most upset was ironically this mean girl at work who thought depression was ""fake sadness."" She cried for one day about it and some people even made jokes about it which made me angry. What shocked me the most is that after 14 days people stopped talking about it entirely. This is the part I cannot get over, it only took two weeks before people stopped speaking about it. This made me feel really weird and actually made me want to die less because I would only be remembered for two weeks which I did not like the idea of. As a result of this I still think about this guy all the time, it has been years since he died but I refuse to let his story die out after only two weeks which is why I am talking about it here. Rip. The people on this subreddit are real and not superficial. We all know that depression is harder than something a few words can change. This is all I had to say for now."
depression,What if depression and suicidal thoughts are just really Nature’s attempt to regulate the size of human population,"
I wanna emphasize the word “attempt” as it’s a miserable one. 
 
But it kinda ticks the boxes. Humans affected like this become basically lethargic or incredibly limited. 

A lot function under really low maintenance, just waiting to die barely eating or interacting with the world. 

So what I’m saying is.         Since it’s natural and all (because everything that is not man-made is natural)  Could this depressive wave that is taking over the world just be a natural occurrence 

designed by Mother Earth to combat the increasing human population that is unsustainably draining the world of its natural resources?!

It kinda just wants us to stay  put or preferably kills ourselves?!"
depression,An interesting title,"My wife is so supportive and hard working. She tells me she loves me several times a day, even on days I don't go to work because I don't want to endure 10 hours in a horrible environment. I'm seeing the futility of trading my time for money as a forklift driver. Trading time for money in any industry is limiting. I don't have any skills or the capital to start up a business or investment where I'm earning money passively. I fear making the wrong decision and losing the little money I have. 
I trust only a few people in my life, the rest I fear will only harm me in some way. 
So many negative thoughts in my head.
Such little faith in the goodness of myself and humanity. 
I fear connecting with people. I fear disagreement. I fear a lot of things.
I fear the birth of my child and how I will handle raising a child. I don't want to screw the child up, and I don't want the world to screw the child up, yet I know for certain the world will since the world is so messed up.
I hate my job but I don't want to look for another one. I always end up hating my jobs. I'm coming to an açceptance of disdain for my vocation. 
I'll be attending a cognitive behaviour therapy support group tomorrow. I hope I find it helpful. Hopefully it will be a place where I can be honest about how I feel about myself and life without being judged. I'm tired of pretending to be something I'm not, i.e happy. I'm not happy about my life or life in general. 
I thought that typing this out for someone to read might help me feel a little better.

Thank you for reading"
depression,What is a way to prevent myself being stuck on my own mind?,"As the title says, I'm in dire need of a way to stop myself from being stuck in my own head and making myself paranoid with overthinking to the point that I'm both not sleeping and not eating now.

Currently I do some very amateur photography and streaming and they help to a point but other ideas would be greatly welcomed!"

depression,Loneliness is eating me from the inside out,"I'm a guy with depression, anxiety, and mild autism. The autism isn't that bad, but it's been enough to cause me to struggle badly socially in my life.

I'm just so damn lonely.. only 1 date in 5 years and no sex for even longer than that. It's so fucking hard to cope with, I haven't found anything that can replace a relationship. Trying to attract women is nearly an impossible task for me. Ya know, I try to mask my weird behaviors and shit, but I'm sure people can tell something is ""off"" about me. It's so damn exhausting anyway to have to play a character to attempt to fit in.

I've tried to maximize my appearance, but it's not enough. I have such a hard time with non-verbal communication, flirting, and dating ""rules"". People usually seem less interested once they spend some time around me.

I want to give up, but I know the loneliness is only making me more depressed. I also quit porn some time ago, which has been great.. but it's brutal not having any kind of sexual outlet at all. I just don't know what to do. I've done therapy and medications and tried my best to learn social skills and interact with people. I've made great improvements from the time I was a teenager, but I don't blend in perfectly. I feel like no one is going to accept me for who I am and I can't ""cure"" myself either.

Like fuck. Isn't there someone who will like me just for how I look? That's all I want. I'm sorry I don't act like every other guy, but it doesn't make me worthless."

I’m married, but it’s not happy and living in a really  bad apartment building where I fear for my life because of my psycho neighbour and no one is doing anything about. My husband doesn’t care that I’m afraid and will not even discuss moving which I don’t understand.  It just seems like things are progressively getting worse. And with that my mental health is getting worse.  All of my friends and family are either frustrated and don’t know what to  say to me or they just don’t have the time. I guess I’m just wondering when things are going to get better."
depression,My Ex got married.,"Fuck its been over two years and I can't fucking feel any better. She dumped me for him. She's was so much of what I loved and everything has been so much worse since I lost her.

She moved to Germany with the intention of me following a few months later. Lo and behold she finds someone new. She dumps me and they are dating right away. Why did she have to treat me so terribly when I did nothing to deserve that? Why do I still love her so much after all this?

Now I find out she married him. We're young. I thought I had a few years before I ever had to mentally prepare myself for this. I think its a ""greencard"" marriage so she can travel back to Germany with the pandemic but it doesn't matter. She loves him.

I haven't found any women attractive since I started dating her so I can't just find someone else. We also knew each other since we were kids so no one else I'll ever meet will know me so deeply. I just want to stop existing at this point."

depression,I don’t have anybody who really cares,"It’s my own fault. I go through periods where I don’t pick up the phone to call my mom, and I won’t see my friends for months at a time. I can’t work at a real job because within six months of getting hired it all goes up in a fiery blaze when I start no-showing and getting high at home instead. My boyfriend says he doesn’t want kids with me because I’d be a bad mom. I’d be a good house wife though I guess. I’m pretty sure he only keeps me around as his personal drug and sex dispensary since I can offer literally nothing else to him.

Everyone has given up on me. My parents don’t call, or respond to my texts. All my aunts and uncles stopped trying to have a relationship with me. My closest friend doesn’t consider herself close with me anymore. I guess I should try to be grateful, because the less people who love me, the less I’m capable of hurting.

I don’t have the motivation or will within me to feel anything but exhaustion. I’m tired. I’m so lonely. This is gonna die in new with the rest of the cries for help, but I think I’m just hoping one person might have heard me and understood. 

Maybe I don’t deserve to be heard. Maybe nobody can understand it because I’m so wrong. But I can’t change it anymore. The person I was who had the ability to adapt and move forward doesn’t exist anymore. All I can do is mimic the same movements I’ve been making for years. I’m so fucking tired of it."
depression,"Hi uhhh, what in the ever loving fuck is wrong with me :)","Hello I'm an 18F ( I'm sorry if I suck at this I'm new to reddit) and the point of this post is to vent and to ask if I'm a spoiled brat who's sad cause I'm not used to the big outside world or if im sad cause something is wrong with me.

I started uni bout a month and a bit ago. Im going to the uni I wanted to and doing the courses I choose and was actively excited to do. I'm living away from home for the first time in a halls of residence and luckily due to living in new Zealand and having amazing parents I have first year free with no loans needed. I've made new friends there and am keeping up with my studies.

It's literally the most someone could ask for in life and I realize how privelleged I am to have this opportunity. What I don't understand is why the fuck I'm so sad. I feel like I have two separate sides in my head the miserable one and the sane side.

The miserable one isn't capable with logical thinking. Doesn't understand that each day you just gotta get through the day or week and not worry so far into the future like next year. This part of me punches it's way through the sane side with overwhelming dread, that I'll never be anything in life, that I'm a disappointment to my family and really I'm just wasting everyones time and money by being around. This side has thought about jumping off the fucking building I live on for gods sake. I don't think I would ever do it cause I'm to much of a scaredy cat to do so but it really scares me sometimes.

The sane side of me, the person who's writing this post right now thinks that miserable side should shut the fuck up and go away. There are other people in the world with it way worse than you, you are wasting the privellege you have by being sad all the time.

You see it's always been this way since I was younger but never this bloody frustrating. I'll be walking back from a cells lecture feeling good about what I've done and my brain will go "" yeah but you still haven't started that ecology report due in a month or what about the geology paper huh, your really just gonna fail this year, be a disappointment to mum and dad ( I love my parents alot they have been the best parents I could possibly ask for) and be a waste to this world"". It breaks me every time and , though I loathe to admit it, crying usually insues. 

I just want to be normal. So I'm using reddit to vent, sorry. I don't want to talk to my parents or friends cause I'll be wasting there time with some stupid whining from a teenage girl. They don't need to be concerned over some stupid hormones or first years stress I'm going through. I don't even know if this is the right place to post it cause depression is a serious mental illness and I'm just confused. I just want to know if anyone at all read through that cluster fuck of a reddit post and I just being sad and crying because I'm a spoiled brat or because there's something wrong with me."

My dad is an amazing and loving man and when I'm with him I genuinely feel at peace and just like I'm home. I dont come by that sort of feeling a lot so I'm very grateful to him for providing that even though he doesn't know it. He cares about me and my siblings deeply and I know that he loves us. My father is a good man. End of story. Just because someone made poor decisions in their past doesn't mean that they're not capable of change. I hope this clears some things up.

depression,I thought I was already past it. But then it came back,"I was dutifully taking my meds. ""Was"" being the keyword here, as it ran out last week. Since I've been taking my meds for 1 whole year, I thought 1 week of no meds while I wait for a restock was no biggie. Boy, was I way off. Apparently without it,  my symptoms came back at full force almost immediately.
Just because i had a bad week, I immediately thought it was a nice life while it lasted. Those ideations became plans in a heartbeat. I have enough self-awareness to realize things are definitely going downhill fast. But knowing what you need to do and feeling if you are up to it are two completely different things. I can't believe I'm this weak-willed. Which kinda reinforces my preconceived notions that the world is better off without me. I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I can't help it. I feel like my support system turned against me. Coincidentally, they're having a bad week, too. Is it too selfish of me to think they should've taken my side at least despite the fact that they're not having a good time, too? I know that the world doesn't revolve around me, but it'd be nice to know that someone backs me up."

I live in a university area so there’s a lot of gross dudes around for sure and a lot of sex crimes are reported and not taken seriously by law enforcement which is appalling. Anyway I was just experiencing a lot of subtle racism and just general ignorance from people around me and this just kinda hit me there lol.

When I'm having a bad day the idea of going for a run is so unrealistic that it reminds me of just how fucking useless this illness has made me. If it's taken me until 2pm to get out of bed and the idea of brushing my teeth feels overwhelming then even going for a walk is going to be too much. Whilst I understand at times it's the right advice, by the time it's got to the stage that someone is offering me it it's already too late and just makes me feel shittier."
depression,it's ultimately better to not get attached,"after losing almost everyone I care about last year, being basically completely on my own and unable to hold a job for pretty much all of the last year (while living off of covid relief) one thing this pandemic has taught me is to not be attached, attachment leads to hope and hope ultimately leads to disappointment, there are no lasting achievements in this life (whether it's a job, relationships or even academic pursuits) nothing lasts for long and you lose so much more than you win so its better to not let yourself care enough for it to be a loss in the first place, hope is the biggest lie we tell ourselves so it's better not to be fooled by it at all"
depression,Fuck I can't keep living,I swear I'm going fucking insane. Yes I swear alot and I cant help it. God damnit man. My whole life is a God damn failure. I have so much anger in me right now I swear I could do it. I could finally kill myself and be gone. Man... Suffering is SO DAMN NORMAL TO ME. why do I have to suffer so much! No way this isn't hell. No way. God damnit. I just wanna slit my throat
depression,I don’t like ppl,"I just use them to feel, I don’t actually care bc I feel near close to nothing emotionally but seek ppl out anyway bc I can’t bare to be left alone. Bc I hate myself I use my interactions w others to escape the fact of how empty I truly am...I don’t truly care for anything..I’m tired of lying..it’s funny I don’t even know if this is a lie. I’m that far gone ig..can’t sleep. Maybe I’m just bored...all the time. Just fucking bored of life..kms never made sense..I’m just fucked up, yeah that seems like the truth...I’ve seen too much fucked shit tho, I actually can’t sleep...at least something bothers me atleast...I wish I wasn’t such a self absorbed prick, that I could meaningfully connect w others..it’s funny I genuinely can’t tell what’s the truth anymore..Ah..hm"

depression,All my friends blocked me (Death?),"I used to have a group of friends around 4-6 people, and 1 of those friends sent a photo of (nezuko porn)&lt;anime character- 

I got mad and all the other things that he did pushed my boiling point to its limit so i sent loli hentai to him.

He is one of those people who try to make the other person look like the bad guy. This was my first mistake, i was receiving death threats left and right and only one person was talking to me like she kinda cared but then she blocked me too. 

At this point i just want to end my life cause those people were the only people i ever called friends. I tried to say sorry but they never accepted it and it was already too late.
What do i do cause im just about to end it."
depression,black sheep,"always been the black sheep in my family  
literally since the day i was born ive only been a scapegoat that no one wants to be around and everyone just throws shit at me.  
same goes for every friends group i have,  always the odd one out and ppl just shittalk me all the time and if I ever try to talk back they just gang up on me and say all kinds of mean shit to make me feel bad or  f.e whenever theres a party and we get someone to drive us there I'm always the one left behind because there's no more spots in the car left for me.  
have even stopped going to family gatherings because only thing I do is sit there and act like a target dummy for people to throw shit at to fill the void between topics,  always ignored when I speak, literally any topic about me is always just negative shit about how I am,  childhood topic=disgusting neglect no one cared about,  adult topic=socially retarded with 0 chances of getting a bright future.  
think this ultimately has led to why im so isolated and can barely function anymore,  ive missed out on countless oppertunities to get a really good and solid career because I just don't know how to speak or act for people to not treat me like a dog.  
No degree,  no job,  no real friends and no social skills whilst everyone else in my family are successful people with children whilst running their own business and being politicans etc.  
went to dinner for easter yesterday with my family and broke down for the first time ever in front of them after being insulted as usual and went home, no one has even asked me why or how i feel 24 hours after it happened.  
truly have no one and feels like everything and everyone is against me"
depression,Depression Analysis Project,"Hi guys. I'm Siddharth and I'm a final year engineering student from India. As part of my final year project, I'm devising a system to analyse depression and depression levels among various individuals based on a sample of their video data. However, the system needs a sufficient amount of samples for it to properly train itself and identify distinguishing characteristics among each level. And we currently don't have enough volunteers to get that many samples. 

All we need is a video sample of you while answering a short 21-point questionnaire. For that purpose, I'll schedule a Zoom meeting in which I'll give the questionnaire and record your video while attempting. The meeting will hardly last 10-15 minutes of your time.

Now, you might've some concerns regarding privacy of your data. But don't worry, *your data won't be made public in any manner whatsoever. It'll only be used for research and analysis purposes.* As an individual, I understand your concerns and I can assure you of the same.

If you'll like to volunteer, you can fill in the following link (*This form is only for contact purposes to schedule the Zoom meeting. The data in it won't be recorded or used for any type of analysis. Your name and other details will remain anonymous*).

Since then a variant of the question ""How can I help you?"" has come up a lot, but I have no idea what to answer. Usually I don't feel like the people are close enough that I deserve any of their time or attention. Also currently in full lock-down so meeting up is also out of the question.

depression,I’m afraid to cry. Is crying worth the shame?,I actually cry all the fucking time because I’m an emotional wreck that is barely functioning but sometimes I refuse to let my tears come out because I feel like it’s not worth crying over. I feel like if I cry it just solidifies the fact that I ever cared about something that I couldn’t have or I lost. I feel stupid over how I feel and even stupider after I cry over it. Currently debating if I should just fucking cry or just suck it up because I’m “better than that” so if you guys could give your opinion I’d appreciate.

I take everything for granted, I just can't believe I did this shit. I just couldn't do it man, couldn't get out of bed anymore. It's been a tough year, but everyone has problems.

depression,Can’t sleep or eat anymore. Planning on ending in by the end of this month.,"3:46 am right now. Keep reflecting on how meaningless my life was and how little I’ve done to do anything for anybody. Everyone would benefit by my end.
I don’t have much faith in things improving. My mind is always racing or forcing itself to relieve painful/traumatic memories and I want it to stop. 
I wish I could’ve done more for the ones I loved. Instead of burdening them for years. 
My dream in life was to find some degree of success where I could support myself and have plenty of resources to help others, including strangers and friends/family. 
I feel awful for letting them all down again, but this needs to be the end. I can’t do this anymore.

depression,"I'm on a Temporary Work Trip and I'm Getting Depressed, Anxious, and Homesick","I (26m) am on a trip as a sub-contractor outside of my home state. I took this job to make money as I was having issues with my finances, living paycheck to paycheck. I work late at night and into the early morning with a team of 25 (give or take) people. I'm staying in an AirBNB with some co-workers until the contract is up. I usually live alone. The contract ends in 3 weeks and if I finish it I'll have some decent money to work with.  


I had to leave behind a cat whom I love dearly and is being cared for by my brother. I'm anxious that he will hate me or won't be as bonded to me when I return. I'm weirded out by the people I've met here; some of them are too unambitious for me. I'm anxious about getting hurt on the job. Not because of the pain, but because I have no insurance and there is no worker's compensation; it's triggered fears of being maimed and being unable to create or teach art. I want to go home, but also want the money as a launch pad for the rest of the year. I'm not someone who likes to quit, yet I do all the time. I'm trying to break the cycle. I don't believe that my mental health is an excuse to rid my life of challenges or responsibilities. The town we are working in is weird, flat, industrial, and smells like garbage. The people here make me uncomfortable and I've had a few nightmares, but a few okay dreams too (it should be noted, I've been off weed for just over 3months now.)  


I just feel trapped. I know I am doing this as a means to an end and that the contract will end soon. I just desperately want it to be over right now. I am sick of quitting efforts when they get too hard. I'm a religious person so I frequently pray for strength and courage. This is different than being ""stuck in a job"" as this is a contract gig I got through a friend who is managing the whole project. I'm aware that there is a list of external factors that are making me feel this way in conjunction with my personal traumas and mental traits.  


I've been diagnosed with Anxiety &amp; ADHD. Depression kinda comes in fluctuations, but my usual mode allows for hope and laughter and joy. I currently do not have access to therapy. The work days feel short but the work week feels long. Does anyone have a recommendation for how to cope with this? I have goals that I have been making slow but steady progress on over time. I miss my cat so fucking much. I'm gonna go drink some water."
depression,I have decided to kill myself by the end of next month.,"I have been fighting with depression since past 3 years and am really tired of it now. I don't have any hopes left that my life will get any better and only killing myself can get me out of this. I don't have any friends or close people that love me so anyone won't miss me. 

I always thought that someday I will be happy but instead everyday was worse for me. Now I am ready to end it so that I won't have to face everyday."
depression,Sometimes when I get really angry I want to destroy things in my room that are important to me,"I got really sad and angry today and I had the urge to break this present that my friend got me. This gift means so much to me and I would never want to actually do something like that. I imagined what it would be like to destroy it, and how I’d feel afterwards. I know that I’d lose my mind and spiral into intense self hated if I actually went through with it. Maybe it’s because I feel like I don’t deserve that gift. Honestly I don’t know. My emotions are a mess."

Even online I feel ignored and an outsider. Everyone tells me to be grateful that i have a family and a decent job. I struggle to go through the day. Am a middle aged man and I cry when no one is around. I also struggle with anxiety. I wake up at night to check on my kids at night if they are breathing. Lockdown made things worse i thought i would be having fun in my mid age crisis ti make up for my lost teenage fun years. But the economy collapse in my country made that impossible.

depression,Is this normal?,"Two weeks ago I received a call to let me know that the man who killed my Dad has been moved to an open prison and that I need to prepare a statement for his parole at the end of this year, I found this extremely difficult to deal with and it brought up a lot of anxiety and grief. Then in quick succession the week after my two best friends dogs died suddenly, we all walked in a group together with our dogs and it was always us three. Now only my dog is left. 

I know they weren’t my dogs but I just feel so down, I cried my eyes out the other day when I found out about the second dog and now I just can’t pick my mood back up, I feel exhausted and on the verge of a panic attack and just really down.

depression,Just a quick question to my therapist. And a rant obviously.,"So yesterday, we was talking about self esteem..yoy said mine was low, and I needed to be more confident in myself.

That I was good looking, and it was really nice to talk to me.

That maybe I wasn't seeing the people interested in me because of this low self-esteem.

So, real question. Why in fucking years, nobody asked to see me ? Why nobody reached me first ? Why am I always the one who ask to see people ?

Why I can only remember one time, and litteraly, one time in years, where someone actually wanted me to come ?

How the fuck do you expect me to have some kind of self-esteem when nobody reach me ? When I'm always the one who ask ?

So, yeah, sorry if I don't believe you when you say I'm good looking and nice to talk with.

I used to be able to help you. Have I ever been able to help you? Date after date after date of planned suicide. I can see your pain. You tell me about it. How  you talk to literally anyone else, even the void that is the internet. Just not me. Apologizing every time after you show the slightest of emotion. Hell you're doing it right now again. Always saying ""I hurt you"" over and over and over. I read your posts here, I never say anything about them. It hurts to see you in pain and me not being able to help you. Always speaking if ""I'm trying so hard to hold on for you"" while casually assuming that I'll be perfectly fine if you jump off the roof. It sometimes feel like my pain is invalidated. I'm sending this out as a post for if you ever come across it. Saying it in person will simply hurt you more, and you won't bother to change how you do things at the end of the day. Want to curl up. Don't want to cry anymore. Have I ever wanted to cry? I need someone to pry the tears out of the weakest part of me, I suppose. Just want to be forgotten by this world.

depression,Depression and anxiety is ruining my life. What should i do?,"I am 25 M from the US. I have been diagnosed with Depression and anxiety at this counseling place. Idk if that was valid. Maybe or possibly lol. I've never reached out to a doctor about my feelings or depression and anxiety. Maybe it could've been a better choice to see a doctor first. I feel like my life has been the same since graduating high school. I want to change but i don't have the energy or motivation to do it. There are days that i would wake up in the morning and just stay in bed no matter how hungry i was i would just lay there and watch youtube all day until i felt like getting up to get something to eat. I have some days that i feel like i should end my life and i think about how i should do it. But i ended up not doing it because i don't want to take my own life. But just having thoughts of it makes me worry. I don't feel like myself anymore and i am not happy. I am always forcing to be happy when im really not and i hate that feeling.  I am always irritable and i work in retail so it's not a good look. Even before and during work i am anxious. I also have social anxiety so i get anxious around social situations. I used to like reading but lately it has been very hard to concentrate and understand what i just read. No matter how many times i reread a page i still cannot process what is happening in the book. So that is why i stopped watching anime because of that problem. I think my depression has gotten worse to the point that i have to fake enjoy a tv show. The sad thing is i don't feel joy anymore and it's pretty hard to feel joy. Yeah pretty much i have lost interest in everything that i liked. Gaming, anime, reading books and manga, drawing and writing it's just unfortunate. All i do is watch Youtube and play some games on my days off. Or stay in bed and take naps throughout the day. Whenever i start on a drawing i think what's the point of drawing when it's gonna take time to get good? Idk how to put what i am feeling into words but i'm trying. I went to see a therapist/counselor before but she was not great. Then i just stopped seeking help. And recently i've been researching about antidepressants and i have been considering on trying them out. I'm just worried about the side effects. And yes i think i should seek out a doc first about my mental health before taking more steps next time. So let me know what i should do? Or what do tou suggest?"
depression,Big fuckup,"I’ve been struggling with depression for the last 10 years. Most days I can’t get out of bed. I’ve been a huge failure, everything I touch turns to shit! It took me 6 years to get my bachelors and since I started working I have been fucking up big time... I make simple mistakes that are sackable. Usually I’m a very nonchalant type where I really don’t care but I’ve been feeling super guilty this past week for fucking up a huge deal for my firm, especially since the partner I’m working with explicitly told me not to fuck up and do something which, i still fucked up, I really don’t know how! Lately I’ve been having trouble concentrating. But I just realized how much of a failure I am. 
My relationship with my family isn’t the best, relationship goals is a big fuck up as well as my friendships.

depression,There is hope for all of us and someday we will shine bright,"I had been ambitious and confident as a kid and achieved some good heights in my life but after losing my college sweetheart after \~5 years of relationship and having no good friends to call in a new city in my first stressful job from my college or my school. I was in a dark phase.

I did not want to look good. I did  not want to excel in my job. I did not want to look into paths of advancement of my career. I did not even want to even go out and enjoy. I felt really disconnected from everything. On top of it, I started smoking cigarettes  regularly (worst decision of my life but I stopped it after a few  months only).

But there, I also started wondering and pondering deeply about life and I wanted to know  what's the benefit of doing or achieving anything as nothing will be permanent ever. I tried some religious stuff, one important advice that I got from it was that it's not really in your control what our life will shape like even after putting all our blood and sweat into it but not putting in any effort will also not result in any significant change in our lives. So we must continue our journey without thinking too much about result of our actions. It's kind of our duty to not  waste our life and lead our lives honestly with the skills and talents we are blessed with.

It took me around an year to recover and become stable. I tried different hobbies like cooking, reading a lot of self improvement  books and some deep poetry. Tried reconnecting with some old friends. Tried to make some new friends. I started to have evening walks, improved my diet and put some concentration back into work by learning what was needed in job. I started looking for what I could do next in my life. Even tried some dating slowly.

I am feeling more balanced this time with gained wisdom. I am willing to welcome again all the new challenges the life will throw at me and I am much more looking forward toward the upcoming opportunities and success in life."

depression,Things I’ve noticed,"I’m sort of new to feeling depressed. It’s been about 8 months. 

I have so much jealousy. I’m jealous of healthy people. I’m so, so jealous of babies, because they don’t have to do anything, but I’m even more jealous of people’s pets, because they don’t ever have to be an adult person.

I have never valued sleeping so much. I fucking adore sleeping. I truly wish I could sleep 24 hours a day, and sometimes I almost do. Insomnia can go fuck itself.

Food is less flavorful. 

Also, I hate myself!"
depression,I’m depressed but everyone keeps downplaying it for me..,"Worth mentioning I (22M) haven’t actually been clinically diagnosed with depression. 

I’ve suffered from on and off depression since I was like 12/13, and anxiety from about 5 years ago. I’ll be super mega depressed for a few months, weeks, even days or years; and then it’ll fade and I’ll be normal for a few months, then it will come back again. These feelings include the usual symptoms: staying in bed all day, not eating (in the past 72 hours I’ve consumed 1 cupcake, 1 cookie and a hot chocolate), sleeping constantly, 0 energy, never wanting to leave the house, not doing chores around the house, even to suicidal thoughts, in the past year alone I’ve literally poured out all the pills we have in the house ready to take them, but as I’m standing there staring at them with a glass of water, I battle in my head for like 15 mins weighing up weather to do it or not, then whilst I’m thinking about not doing it I quickly dispose of them before I change my mind again. 

I keep SOME of this info to myself, and share other bits. I’m kind of that typical male, I literally HATE talking about my feelings. I don’t think it helps me, and i don’t know how to describe it I just really really hate those deep heart to heart conversations people have, I don’t know why I just do. 

I live with the love of my life who suffers severely from clinically diagnosed anxiety, and of course with that comes spells of depression herself. She’s always super supportive, and always there for me, she’s incredible. That being said, just recently I’ve been hearing comments from people like “I don’t think you have depression, I just think you’re depressed”. And this fucks me off to no end. My gf mentioned to her parents (who are great with me, they like me, I like them, we have a very friendly relationship) about how I’d been feeling recently and her mum said “he’s not depressed, trust me I can tell he doesn’t have depression he’s just sad”, my gf told me this and said she actually thinks the same and I’m just experiencing really low mood. But I KNOW I am not. I had been to CBT and my therapist said I have the classic signs of depression, my doctor said the same and prescribed me anti depressants, went to a second therapist and she also believes I have mild autism, but we couldn’t continue that therapy due to financial implications of being a homeowner at 21/22 lol. i have suicidal thoughts and literally hate pretty much every aspect of my life minus a select few. 

Yet nobody believes me, I’m being tortured by my own mind, the only way I can even begin to make it stop is with peoples help, but nobody believes me. I’m at a loss, this is the exact attitude that kills people; I just don’t understand, me and my gf had a mutual friend who killed himself on NYE just gone following severe mental health issues, and everyone talks about how horrible it is; until the funeral is over, then it’s business as usual again. It was quite a big story in our local town and everyone was sharing posts on social media saying “it’s ok not to be ok, speak out” etc and then I do and people just put me down and say I’m over reacting. 

I genuinely could not count how many times I’ve thought about killing myself, easily triple digits if you include a passing thought then dismiss it. and I’ve come close to doing around 3 or 4 times; but I’m apparently not depressed. Why does nobody care? This isn’t my brain telling me this either, this is physically evidenced by what I have seen objectively, nobody actually cares, they just say they do. I’ve reached out to a couple of my closest friends, and they’ve left read receipts on my messages and not replied; needless to say I have nothing to do with them anymore; but what is it about me that makes people just not give a shit? I’m not even trying to play the victim here, I know a ridiculous amount of people suffer from what I am, and I’m nothing special, but I really really don’t think anybody wants to help me. My mum cares, but me and my brother are all she has and I cannot break her by telling her how I actually feel. 

I’m not really asking a question, and I’m not too upset about this rn; but that one comment has been really bothering me since it was said. Because it’s something I’ve heard so so many times and I want to get this off my chest. This is just a vent post really. 

“You don’t have depression, you’re just depressed”. 

Eh, I don’t fucking know, I have no idea how the human race or this planet works, and it really really bothers me."
depression,Serious trough of depression. Can't trust my family anymore.,"Very lost at the minute. Hurt deeply by my own family. Unfortunately several events have happened at the same time that's dissolved all of my trust in them. They openly treat me as a second rate citizen and don't give a shit. Every member of my family is a woman. There are no other men around, they despise them all.

They will speak with each other about issues (global political to local and personal) but with me/men they only maintain the warped reality they will ensure is completely normal. &lt;&lt;I have seen this contribute to the psychological degradation of several men.

I want them to know that they should be ashamed of themselves. That how they conduct themselves is against everything they taught me on feminism and equality.

A little advice. Knowledge is power. Playing stupid can cause people to drop their walls a little and become lazy about their deceptions. This will open them up to 'secretly' speaking truths in front of your very face.. Be careful what you wish for. Knowledge is power, but it also hurts"
depression,"I'm not suicidal, but I'm ready to die","It's comforting really, the thought of being finally ""released"" from this chain we call life.


I would never kill myself. It will only bring shame and sadness to my family. Plus, the religious doctrine implanted in my head since I was a kid will always haunt me.


But yeah, ideation of death is soothing."
depression,I don't know who I am anymore,Started to hear voices and see shit months ago tried to tell people just got weird looks its becoming normal I was in the shop buying some food got told to buy ice cream listened like a puppy I thought voices in your head was ment to tell you to kill people but I'm being forced to buy ice cream I hurt myself I don't even like ice cream it makes me sick
depression,Feeling like an afterthought,"does anyone else feel like an afterthought in peoples lives? almost like people don't want to talk to you unless they have nothing better to do. i feel like that a lot. i have this one friend, for example, who rarely ever seems interested in the conversations we're having. it always feels like she's trying to end it as soon as possible and she can sometimes go days without texting me back

i get that people are busy, and maybe i'm being selfish, but i still feel like i'm always going to be everyone's last choice to talk to or do something with. and i don't feel like i have anyone i can talk to about whatever's going on in my life"
depression,How did you get out of your depression?,[removed]
depression,Can I cut things off with someone in a depressive episode?,"I was seeing a guy who started out really intense and then cut things off because he “was a mess”. He came back to try and start things up again because he said that he was scared but he really liked me and wanted to see each other and have better communication etc. I said yes and now it’s been a month, I’ve seen him twice and he’s gone really distant and says he’s in a depressive episode. I really like him but it’s harming my mental health. Can I cut it off and if so how should I do it? Or should I wait until he is in a better place? I can’t just leave it and let it fizzle because I feel hope that things will change and be better (I know this isn’t likely to happen) and I’m the type of person who needs a line in the sand to really move on."
depression,Why.,"Irs crazy. Im 23 with nothing to look forward too. I feel like i keep trying so hard and nothing ever works out for me. When i got fired for some trumped up charges on Wednesday i did what i thought i should do.i relasped pretty hard. I had xans, lean, and alcohol in my system. At one point in my drug filled binge i just laid on my kitchen floor and just started crying. I dont wanna lose everything but somehow im going too anyway. I ran out of drugs but i knew i couldve easily died that same night. Im still thinking about doing it again. Just hoping someone out there hears this."
depression,Feel like ending things,"I’m new here, just want to say I’m always so drained and tired all the time and super unmotivated like there’s no point at all. Kept having visions of me killing myself as a means of ending things. I hate when my brain keeps on over thinking stuff sigh..."

depression,Why cant I cry,Wtf like why? I try so hard but I cant do it. What is wrong with me
depression,Broke up with a soulmate now its end,[removed]
depression,Why does everything feel like a chore?,"Even things I loved doing before, feel like such a drag! Even videogames, I'd play half an hour and get bored, I used to love sculpting, painting, writing poems, I feel like I'm fed up with everything and just want to be left alone and cry!

I just want to find something I could enjoy, instead of staying all day in my bed..."
depression,"My life is pretty good, and I know that I'm fine deep down. But for some reason I just can't stop negative thoughts like 'things are going to get worse' or just worrying about everything. It makes me procrastinate and I've been in a worse place before but I can't see to stop it, what's going on?","So this started a couple of years ago and I went through hell, but I pulled through and now it seems like I'm spiraling down again. I learnt a lot when it comes to detaching from your thoughts, I think mindfulness is the answer, but I can't seem to keep at it anymore. I just want to do stuff and enjoy them but it's hard to get motivated to do much. I just can't stop overthinking and concentrate on something."
depression,"When you have no choice but to sleep all day because nothing interests you, and you escape your thoughts for a little bit.","Currently laying in bed, realising I don't want to get up, I don't want to do anything at all. If I sleep, I escape my thoughts for a tint little while, until I eventually start to dream about them too (I'm at this stage). 

Why does life take so long to live when you don't want it?"
depression,How do I get rid of bad thoughts?,"Even hearing a word can trigger unwanted thoughts, im sick and I'm tired, all those thoughts drain me of energy!

A therapist was a total waste of money! They did nothing but question ""So what you did you do last month? And what you plan for the next month?""

Survive, what else do you want me to do? Climb Everest? All they did is give examples from other cases... I don't even want to go into details, it was like going to an interview every time!"
depression,I just realize how much i sacrifice my childhood being happy and oblivious to protect my mom so that I don’t have to one day wake up and discover her dead body. Ahhhhh this is painful!!,[removed]
depression,Once my parents and cat pass,"Then I wanna die too. There's nothing in this world for me. I don't know what I did to end up with this fate but I'm sad, lonely and hopeless and it hurts. Things will never get better for me."
depression,Depression Survivor. Anyone?,"
Even before I begin, let me clarify by stating that I ain’t no psychologist nor any expert, but just a survivor. 

english is not my first language, so kindly excuse .
Stats mostly specific to India.




Never realised when depression befriended me, and started helping me in digging up a pit, which was bottomless. The purpose of digging the pit, even today , I have no idea. But I know that I did dig it and the experience was harrowing and frightening, every moment and everyday.

The friend request from depression was accepted by me, because circumstances were such , and when there is no ‘ real ‘ help, we ultimately start holding hands with depression. In reddit terms could the ‘ D4M ‘ call it Depression for Me! Yes, there were so many people around me, and so many friends or family members, but the symptoms got ignored or they did not know that such symptoms could lead to such a situation. Because ‘ mental health ‘ has mostly been swept under the carpet, because the person has his ‘ screw loose ‘ , ‘ empty head office ‘ or the quintessential ‘ mental ‘ . These are some of the choice words society has for those suffering from mental health issues. Instead of providing a helping hand, we become the ‘ Live! ‘ source of entertainment for most.

In my humble belief, many of us know that we are slipping into depression, but fear of societal taboo and fear makes us wait for tomorrow, which sadly never comes. Thus everyday we slip, bit by bit and inch by inch. Our inner souls cry out for help, but the outer body is in denial mode. remember when you had that bad dream, the lucid one, you know that you know that the dream is bad, and you need to wake up, and you are trying, but there is that invisible barrier which you seem never to break. The feeling is similar. Our souls cry for help. But call it in a parallel universe, there is no communication in between.

It feels like an invisible barrier separating us from reality, everyone and everything is there, yet I am not there. So where am I?

My mind is in an infinite loop, repeating the past and the would be future, imagining things, and replaying scenario’s which may never happen. And we find real meaning and extract vibes from these imaginary horrific and irrational scenario’s . The energy from these provides us with the force to dig the holes deeper. The bottomless pit, with darkness all around.

The feeling is that of a frog in a well, the escape is visible, but it is too high too jump through. take one step to get out, but fall back two. As the equation plays out, the result is negative, hence no escape. The only option that i have is to wait and watch, or put my own effort. I did realize, that the ultimate outcome of digging this pit shall lead to self termination, and in what horrific ways, i shudder to think of it today.

then i thought, if self termination was the outcome, then what would happen to my parents or the offsprings of siblings? How would they remember me? As a coward!

I could have been many things in life, but never a coward. Got slapped by many girls, beaten up by a mob, charged into a gang of robbers, lifted a car single handedly, jumped from the 2nd floor, failed innumerable times in life, broke many bones, got many stitches and never lucky with girls. But never a coward. And this sparked something within me.

did I really want to self terminate and leave these few close family members in grief all throughout their lives? I can fight, I can try and give it a shot. I may not come out successful as ever or most of them around me, but atleast I would be alive. This life my parents gave me, and I have no right to take it. I did not believe in the theory of God or supreme being, but aliens and earth being an galactic zoo was acceptable to me!

Slowly I reached out to my parents, and made a few changes in my life and thought process.

I accepted my situation, and stopped crying over spilled milk. Today, I even joke about my past life and every bad action of mine is a cause for laughter, if not for anyone, but for me. I do not shy away from telling about my mistakes. I did them, and I accept full responsibility. the chains of the past cannot hold me back from advancing to the future. Past is gone, lets make the future.

Engaged myself in anything and everything. Remember the phrase, empty mind is a devil’s workshop. I did not let it happen. took up hobbies which I may have not considered in my past life. And I did try, because I did not want to end up at the pit of the dark, unfathomable place once again. It is dark, frightening and very cold. Hell seems much nearer from the pit.

Opened up about my situation to my friends and family, and they have been understanding to provide with whatever support possible. There is so much that others can do, rest we have to do it for ourselves. They sometimes acted as the last mile connectivity. never sought professional help, but the desire to visit them remained.

time flies by, and if it was easy to sink into the pit, it took much longer to come out. And everyday was not easy, still somedays I would sink into the pit, slip a few steps. But the resolve remained, and patience and perseverance prevailed. the path ahead is still very slippery, and like any drug addict slipping back into the bottomless bit is a very probable situation, still it does not mean that I should not try.

I try. and live life to it’s fullest. Some even told me, consider it as your second life. And very few people in this world get it. this made me remember a Chinese proverb, The day you realize that you have only one life, you have started living your second life.

Sometimes I do think, did depression really ‘ Unfriend ‘ me or I ‘Blocked ‘ it? And I shudder to think of the real answer.

I am not qualified enough to give any advice or suggestion to anyone who might be digging their own bottomless pit, but if you know that it’s happening. Seek out for help. And those around such individuals, get help. Pronto!

depression,Anyone else tired of being told how amazing you are?,[removed]
depression,How do you trust and let others care for you when depressed?,"I feel like it’s extremely difficult to let people in my world when I’m depressed. When I’m in a dark hole, there is just me. I will withdraw and there’s no intimacy with anyone. I am a different person and it’s a dark side that I am so afraid to show anyone. 

How do you learn to trust and let others love you when you are battling depression?"
depression,It Happened Again,"This may trigger some, but I just have to vent somewhere and don’t know where to go. This has me feeling more and more helpless and depressed as time goes on and is even hard for me to type out right now. 

My wife (31 F) and I (32 M) have been together almost 4 years and married for almost 2 years. They been wonderful years together and I love her very much. After getting married, our thoughts turned to having children, as they’re something we both want very much. We got pregnant last year and it sadly ended in a miscarriage right before the holidays. Needless to say, our Thanksgiving and Christmas were not joyful at all with that looming over us. I tried to put on a strong facade for my wife, who understandably was very broken up by the ordeal. We vowed to try again though, and last month we found out that we were pregnant once more. 

This morning she started spotting again, just like last time. 

I just don’t understand why.

I don’t know if we can go through this again and still be okay. My wife is despondent and I cannot do anything to console her. I feel like a failure of a husband. I feel like I’ll never be a father. I feel like a failure of a man and human being. The physical and mental toll is absolutely crushing and I just feel myself slipping and I don’t know if I can put that mask back on for my wife’s sake. I don’t know what to do, and there doesn’t seem like anything I *can* do. I just don’t understand."
depression,🌊,"it feels like ur drowning and whenever some1 notices they say “just swim” - like yeah i would if i could, i want to but you know, im ?? drowning ?? like trying to stay afloat but obviously its not working and im just getting more and more sucked into the abyss of the ocean
thats like the only way im able to describe the way ive been feeling"
depression,Feeling really low today,"Well it’s another day of hopelessness. It’s a tuff day for me, I’ve had to resign from work from a job of 25 years due to inability to properly handle stress. I’d tried cutting my wrist, (it’s very difficult to accomplish, hence ended up being sever cutting on my arm) and failed at drinking eye drops. I was just released from a mental health facility, where sometimes I wish I was back. Therapy starts next week and all I can do is think about hurting myself. My wife won’t leave me alone for a second either. So here’s to the struggle today, may the odds not be in my favor"
depression,"Social anxiety, anxiety and depression are killing me.","I don't even know where to start a post like this, other than my wine inhibition has allowed me to.
The only thing im comfident in is music. Im a great songwriter/guitarist.
But its all im good at. I used to be in a touring but not financially stable band, while teaching guitar. Which was great in my early 20s. But wasn't even minimum wage.
The company i worked for went bankrupt. 

I found a job in a sales roll in a call centre, which induced social anxiety everyday. I somehow got good at the job but was socially inept with anything to do with co workers. Ended up someehow gaining management position, only through longevity. Even that was a social battle.
I lost that job at the start of covid. 

I have a new job, where I hyped my experience but its not working because this company is super social. Im not thay type of person. Im lost. All im confident in is music. But music makes no money.
I don't have any similar interests with my co workers.
I don't think I can make it in this industry, let alone any other.
Im depressed and anxious. 
I feel like I can't do anything that's not art. No medications help. Im lost.
Has anyone had the same?"
depression,e,1pm head hurts want to go to bed and sleep till it's night
depression,I feel like I may be going crazy,"I decided to go out today, which is very rare for me. I was with a couple of friends and we were talking and I had smoked and drank a bit. I zoned out and kind of brought me back to my bad trip on salvia, where I felt like I was the only person in the world. 

I was completely zoned out, in my thoughts, then my friends GF asked me how I was doing. I subconsciously said fine, but I remember zoning out to a point where I was just staring at her as if we were the only 2 people in the world. My mind was telling me some crazy stuff like, wow it should be us together, and if I wait long enough it will happen. When I don't even have feelings for her and I would never do my friend like that. Then finally I snapped out of it. I felt so weird and not sure why I zoned out like that. Let alone, I hope she and everyone didn't see me looking like that. I just felt crazy.

The whole night after was rough, I threw up on myself and proceeded just to be antisocial for the majority of the night. Even when I do try and talk, people usually talk over me. I try to be positive and spread positive energy but can't help the fact that I'm depressed and ultimately just feel alone. I do have some 'good friends and a supportive mom, but I just can't seem to be happy. I want to fall in love and have someone care about me but how can I expect that from someone when I don't even love myself and can't really socialize properly. I'm sad, depressed, and alone and I don't know how much more I can take."
depression,Any techniques you can suggest for people with depressed partners during lockdown?,"My gf recently has been having breakdowns and suicidal ideations ever since the lockdown has been reimposed. I couldn't visit her, so we've been trying to come up with techniques to avoid triggers like minimizing social media exposure, minimizing interactions with family that may cause triggers, not drinking coffee for the duration of the lockdown
...etc.

I was wondering if you guys have any more suggestions?"
depression,I really hate fake happy go lucky people,You know the type - the ones who are “professional” yet are perfect and have this holier than thou approach. Rich and entitled and good looking and are the douchey ones who pretend to act like they care. God I hate the fakeness. I fucking hate myself and want to die ASAP

depression,"My tip to make cleaning a bit easier, maybe",[removed]
depression,Dark time for a laugh,"In my past now and looking back from a good place I can laugh at the timing of it, but at my worst moment when I felt like I was alone and everyone was walking past to leave me to my struggles I called a suicide hotline and got put on hold. Picture me outside sitting beside a creek near naked and crying in the rain listening to elevator music 😂. On a more serious note I see people on the dole all around me who can work but choose not to for no reason than the dole pays them well to do nothing and I always think back to that moment and wish we could have those lines given some proper funding. I got through thanks to a mate who came looking for me, but the next person might not have been found or left been heard from again after that moment they couldn't find a way through."
depression,i cant do this anymore,what’s the least painful way to die? i cant take anymore pain
depression,Books- the double edged sword,"I’m stuck in this little cycle. I read a book to escape. Then, when I’m done, my life feels so comparatively empty that I often end up feeling worse. Then I can’t cope and need to escape again, only to end up in the exact same position. Torn between needing the freedom of a story, and dreading how it highlights my own ineptitude. What do I do?"
depression,Feel like I’m falling off the edge.,"hey,

I’ve had a really bad time lately and i feel like i’m slowly falling apart. i’m in a job where i don’t get respected. my fiancé and i are always have shitty little arguments and i take them to heart. i’m so quick to lose my temper but so slow to cool down. i’m just really, deeply sad. i don’t know what to do, i don’t want to hate life anymore. 

i don’t understand why i’m so broken. on paper, i have a nice life, but i’m just unhappy :/

how do i get through this?"
depression,Remember when crying was a thing?,"Being able to feel sorrow enough that it builds up inside, and the feeling of some type of relief just letting it all out? I knew it was gonna get worse but holy shit."
depression,"Kinda done with life, but feeling completely normal about it","Hey!

Just writing her for something of an outlet. I’m 23 years old and kind of at a rut in life. It kind of all feels like a rut. I’ve had it tough, but you know, there’s always someone who has it worse. Some of my suffering was earned, some not, and it’s all relative anyway. But I can’t for the life of me find some reason to live. I don’t want it. None of it.

I feel like society has taken me hostage. I’m to work diligently and suffer quietly, or be a financial burden on the rest and suffer as much or more. I don’t want the human experience. I don’t want the potential ends. I guess I’m ungrateful to it, or perhaps the human experience is just something for monkeys. Whichever way, society won’t give me access to an easy way out. I can’t decrease my suffering, or the suffering of those who process my corpse. It won’t give my family and acquaintances the calming and sympathetic framework to understand and respect that life is only worth living if you want it, and that death would bring me the most peace. It won’t even let me be remembered for who I am, it’ll be pronounced cowardice, like they’re aware that life is some kind of imprisonment.

I hope there’s no afterlife, no rebirth, nothing. I hope the world will some day be moral enough to offer a tranquil way out for anyone who wants it."
depression,"I’m not a failure, but I still want to die","I’m in my early 20’s, graduated with a bachelor’s degree, self-sufficient with a steady job, and have a boyfriend of 2.5 years. I don’t think I’m a failure, but I’m still so indifferent about being alive. My life is on a good track, but I still feel completely indifferent about my existence continuing. I’ve wracked my brain, but there’s honestly nothing I look forward to about my life. Living is such a chore. Advice on how to find something that makes me not want to be dead is appreciated.

Edited to add: or honestly, I’d just love to hear from others who might be in a similar place. I feel so alone in this."
depression,I ate chocolate and I actually enjoyed it! I watched a true crime video for an hour and I thought it was interesting!,I haven’t been able to enjoy junk food or entertainment for so long because of my depression. I feel so proud of myself!
depression,What am I?,[removed]
depression,I can't see any other way out,"I am so trapped. I constantly feel like I'll be the one who takes my life in my family.  Today I wrote: 

 

'Unsure of whether I should fear

That I see no other exit. 

All worn out and broken down.

A soul that is decrepit. 

I don't see peace or longevity that'll end in my omission

for when my journey ceases - it'll be of my volition'"
depression,Depression changed my voice completely.,"My voice got so much deeper, more monotone than ever, quieter and it cracks nonstop lol it doesn't matter if I cry.

Now I always try to speak in a higher tone with my family and add higher or lower intonations into my speech so I sound normal even tho I know I sound more fake than ever. Also, talking fast seems so damn impossible I give up"
depression,Welp. I’m very tired.,It’s my 29th birthday. I’m profoundly disappointed that there are theoretically so many more birthdays in my future. I can’t fathom feeling like this for another 29 years.
depression,i think my brother is why i developed depression,"ever since my brother and i grew up together, he’s bullied me relentlessly. one time i remember locking myself in the bathroom because i was afraid he’d hurt me. i was 12 and he was 16. he banged on the door and called me a bitch because i wouldn’t give something to him. it’s always been like that. he would grab things out of my hands and basically get me to do whatever he wanted because he’s a lazy piece of shit. now whenever i bring up the way he treated me when we were younger, he apparently remembers none of it. i think he resents me because he was abused by our father and our dad treated me the total opposite. i was too scared to practice my native language because he would laugh at my accent and poor grammar. so for years, i never practiced. i fucking hate him. i tried for years to get him to like me and he can’t even remember the countless times he’s made me feel helpless and scared. i fucking hate him. now he’s matured but i fucking hate him."
depression,Skipping therapy,I’ve missed therapy for the past month and a half and I’ve had a mental breakdown about twice every week. I always tell myself I don’t need it but then that shit happens and I fucken hate myself. I’ll be popping Tylenol or some shit then be like “what would happen if I took this whole ass bottle right now?” I’ve been through bad shit in life and then question even needing therapy. But fuck it right. Hate this feeling.
depression,Tired...,"Well todays refill day, 30 new percs. Ya mans gotta go"
depression,I am tired,Good night
depression,I don’t know how to work anymore,"I’ve been in a depressive episode for a couple of days now and haven’t gotten any work done. I’ve been able to make up excuses but I can’t keep doing that. I don’t understand how people keep their jobs during this. I’ve always just quit when it happens and found something new or taken a week off with some excuse, but that was service industry. Now I’m working a remote office job and don’t know what to do 
I just don’t have the motivation to do it and I can’t believe it may be this way forever. It’s terrifying"
depression,Switching Therapist?,[deleted]
depression,Slipping more and more...,"A year ago (pre-Covid), I was nearing 5 years sober, was the CTO of a great company, met my now fiance, hit the gym 4-5 times a week. Life was pretty good. So, Covid hit, our business closed, I had to go on unemployment, started drinking and doing other things, stopped working out and needless to say, made my life a mess. I'm supposed to get married next month and I just can't seem to get my shit together again. I'm disgusted with myself and lately, all I do is sleep. I go on these binges and that basically takes 2-3 days to recover just from that. 

I've alienated myself from all my friends, don't have family to talk to except a surviving sister who is also a shit show right now. I just can't seem to snap out of this and it's been a year!! Can anyone relate? Am I crazy?"
depression,I feel so burned out and depressed,"It’s getting harder and harder to get up in the mornings. Since the 14. November everything besides groceries and going to work closed in my country. I just can’t deal with it anymore.

I barely have any social contacts, I live alone and family wise I „only“ have my dad left. I try to have walks and to do online dating - but it just doesn’t give me anything back at this point anymore. Also I am an average guy, and dating is not working that good for me (I get on dating apps maximum 1 match a month. It is something that gives me hope on the one side, but is also brutal on the other side). 

Lastley my few close friends are either very wealthy and don‘t mind the lockdown at all, or they are very deep into addiction. It‘s also hard to connect with both of them since about Christmas. They don’t understand or are mad about me. And i don’t want to call them every third day because I feel like crying. I feel very ashamed.

Like the title says, I feel very depressed and want to cry and sleep until forever."

depression,what do you guys eat when you are too depressed to cook?,"Whenever I’m feeling particularly depressed (which is often) I have a hard time eating because I lack the energy to make anything. And I know some of you can relate to this struggle! So I am looking for the most simple, low-effort meals that aren’t terrible for my health. What do you guys make? I can’t live on pb&amp;j and frozen chicken nuggets forever..."

depression,I'm not alive for my own sake,"The only reason I'm still here is for the sake of my friend and family. Most of them doesn't deserve the trauma that comes when someone close to you dies suddenly. I both love them and hate them for that. If I got to choose without any regards as to anybody else's feelings, I probably wouldn't be here, but unfortunately I too have feelings. I've seen and experienced myself how it feels when somebody you care about die, and I can't possibly bring myself to be the cause of such suffering, no matter how much I suffer in the process of being alive. I really wish I didn't have to, but here we are."

depression,"I really just need to talk, need support and encouragement.","A few years ago life took a sudden and shocking detour into mental illness, without prior history. Life and myself both unraveled. Today medication is finally working and I'm healing. But looking around at the tatters of myself and my life is becoming really overwhelming. Will anyone talk with me about this?

In hindsight, when the fog of illness appeared a few years ago it blinded me to myself and my words and actions. I can see so many horrible blind spots now. I've hurt people while I've been hurting, I've made *epicly* stupid mistakes, and I've been thoroughly self-absorbed. I lost a lot of friends. At the time I felt abandoned, and I was, but now looking back I'm ashamed to say that I deserved it.

This is keeping me up at night. There's so much, it's like flood gates were opened. I've done my best to face it all, sort it out, be kind to myself, forgive myself, and not shove it back down. It's a lot though. I hoped that I'd start to feel better, but it isn't getting easier. I'm exhausted.

I'm not ""hanging on"" to anything, or dwelling, or torturing myself. ""Just let it go"" is exactly what I want to do. It's a monster of anxiety and shame and regret that won't leave me alone. I'm so overwhelmed. I just want to feel better."

depression,I don’t deserve you,"You have been very nice to me. I got mad at you for no reason again. You had a bad day and you still calm me down and not get mad at me. My wordings and tone wasn’t nice. You were still nice to me. I don’t deserve someone so nice in my life. 

You love me unconditionally. I am a mess. My emotions are fragile. I get sad. You were there for me and still talk to me. You still remind me how much you love me. I don’t deserve your love. 

I am a terrible person. I overdramatise everything. There was no break to my constant “bad mood”. There wasn’t a day where I’m not mad or upset or depressed about something. And you are still here. I don’t deserve you."
depression,Fun activities to do with an online depressed friend?,"I'm not personally depressed but I have a friend who means the absolute world to me. I've known her for about 3 months and she doesn't know reddit is a thing so I'm not really worried about her finding me here. With my IRL depressed buddies pre-quarantine I'd always try to include them in my plans just to show how much they mean to me, but I found reaching out to depressed friends can be waaaaay harder which sucks. 

Currently all we do is Netflix party mostly because none of us are really big on multiplayer games. We sometimes make each other playlists but I was wondering if someone can list some stuff they can do with their online friends. You don't have to be depressed to help me out.

The one thing I try to avoid is forcing her out of her comfort zone. I make preemptive plans with her and depending on her mood from texting her I try to gauge whether or not she really wants to do it. I don't want to force her to go through with it just because she made the plan with me and we get along quite well so its no big deal to turn down the plan for either of us. The problem is that we're also kinda running out of shows we both like and watching shows too often can suck. It doesn't help that I got ADHD so I end up usually getting off topic and losing track of the show which can be understandably frustrating for her, although surprisingly she hasn't lashed out on me. It might be that she's a really patient and amazing person. 

But yeah. 

love you all &lt;33333."
depression,"Depression as a single, childless adult","I literally don't have to do anything if I don't want to. I don't have to get out of bed. I don't have to shower, do my hair, answer the phone, nothing. I don't have anyone depending on me that serves as a motivator. The only person to hold me accountable is me and it's so draining. It's so hard to take recovery seriously when you know you're at an age and in a situation in life where you can simply opt out of everything with no consequences and it feels like you're ""fine"" when you've simply just stopped doing anything that involves an iota of challenge. And with quarantine, don't get me started. I feel like I could lay in bed and just rot without anyone fighting for me. What (other than kids or a SO) motivates you guys to keep pushing for recovery?"
depression,Telling my parents / getting help?,"I’m not really sure what to do because I have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and self harm (cutting for about 5 years now) since I was 11 and I am now 17. I have also dealt with suicidal thoughts for a lot of my life and had previously attempted when I was 14 but i didn’t tell anyone since i was unsuccessful. I honestly don’t really see a reason in living, I don’t have the motivation to do anything really. I have always been the type of kid that keeps everything to themselves because I didn’t want to worry my parents and because I felt like a burden. 

But finally about 2 years ago I opened up to my parents about what I was going through but I didn’t tell them about my attempt or self harm. I actually told the social worker at my school who then called my mom in (which i can’t do now since i’m doing online school bc of the virus). and first I saw my doctor who diagnosed me with clinical depression and then my parents got me a therapist. I saw the therapist for a total of 2 hours before they stopped taking me. I’m not sure why, but they genuinely thought that those two hours were supposed to help me just get completely rid of my depression. It kind of bothered me because it took a lot for me to tell them I was struggling. After they took me out of therapy they would just tell me things like “you need to help yourself” and that I need to
motivate myself and it just made me feel really misunderstood. 

Now i don’t know what to do because i lie to my parents about everything because I constantly feel like i’m disappointing them. And by that I mean I lie about my grades, so right now they think i’m doing really good in school when it’s the complete opposite. I lied when my mom asked me if i was doing better and if therapy helped. I basically created this situation and now I don’t know what to do because my mental health is the worst that it’s ever been but every time i try to get help i stop myself because i don’t want to worry my parents. I don’t want my mom to cry over me or for my little sister to see how fucked up i am. 

I just really don’t know what to do anymore, I wish I was just able to open up to people because then I wouldn’t be in this situation. I know that i need help but i have no clue what to do."
depression,I’m sorry,"I know I told you I would wait till my birthday before doing anything drastic, but I can’t live with this pain anymore. I work so hard but I never see real results. All I ever wanted was to be happy but I can’t even recall the last time I felt like it. I’m a failure and I hope you can forgive me for making you not just an acquaintance but a friend, you would be so much better off without me which is why I purchased a bunch of pill and am gonna chug em down at once tonight and hope something will go the way I want to die once in my sleep. I hope by the time you’re reading this I’m dead and you forget about me, there was nothing you could have done and I’m glad you won’t have to bear the pain of knowing me. If I’m not dead then hopefully you won’t read this and it won’t get sent, but I just want to let you know that I have given up on being happy, you tried your best but you couldn’t do the impossible. Maybe when I’m alone in hell I’ll finally find peace after feeling all the pain I deserve."
depression,I'm so grateful for understanding doctors,"They really make the world a better place, thank you. I went to the doctors for a headache, and after some talking I ended up getting an appointment for therapy which I never expected from today's visit..because I only came for a headache. She was so understanding and kind I didn't felt judged 😭"
depression,BPD?,"I don’t think I’m alcoholic. I’m not dependent on it. When I drink too much though I tend to black out and In those moments I become someone I don’t recognize. It’s been happening a lot lately. From what people have told me I get emotional, needy, aggressive, self abusive, etc. When i get to know someone new that i like i fuck it up. I end up calling them and confessing my love or that i want to be with them. I hate being that guy. I should stop drinking all together honestly. When I wake up after the wreck I caused I get these urges. Urges like I deserve to be hurt for what I did. I slap myself, punch myself, punch a wall, I think I cut myself in the past too. A friend referred it as jekyll/hyde transformation. I hate that everyone I care about has seen/dealt with me this way. I don’t know how to deal with this. Is its BPD? Is split personality? Is that person just me at my core? 

I’m depressed for several reasons but this is the one that’s been eating away at me. It’s been happening a lot lately. I tried getting a psychiatrist but I don’t have the first apt till two weeks from now. I should just stop drinking. I’ve tried controlling it but I don’t know the limit. One minute I’m fine and the next I wake up in my bed not knowing what I did but know I fucked up. 

Any and all input I think would help"
depression,Wasted my year,"Please help me, I took a gap year from studies to take care of my physical and mental health cause I was and am too depressed but I failed to do so. I couldn't be consistent in diet so I just wasted my year, oh man I feel so bad. I am considering to take another year gap. What do I do? I just can't study like this, I am too depressed to even get out of bed. I wanna lose weight man but I just can't be consistent."
depression,The world has gone to absolute sh*t,"It's quite obvious, Covid-19 is killing millions, gangs rule every social structure, hierarchies within people's minds ruin the experience of socialising with literally anyone because people's ego have inflated to the point it could explode, feminists have gone way too far, terrorism looms from every corner, just waiting. People are being killed casually, shootings casually happen daily, masculinity is at it's final crisis where old norms are being re-evaluated and discussed. Everyone is depressed. Everyone is anxious and life seems to be one huge pointless, mindless and destructive bid for control. Humans each generation are getting weaker physically and mentally. Idiots rule our country, cruelty is the norm, and all I hear is shit about more death on our streets. We have become the apathetic generation and honestly I wish we would all die for the sake of ending human suffering. We were biologically not created to be happy. And we have destroyed everything we have touched. Life is just not worth the good things that come from it. It will ALWAYS be outweighed. I suspect a homelessness crisis is going to happen / worsen the new one. This I never signed up for. Fuck this."

depression,Do you people feel like you're helpless and can't do anything to fight back while your life crashes like the stock market in 1929?,"I tried everything in my power (talking to people, trying to increase my self esteem, attempting suicide, ignoring and downplaying my depression, even trying to dismiss my depression by telling myself that people have it worse) except therapy because 

1) I'm too socially inept to even hold a conversation
2) parents telling my depression as just a phase or don't get stressed
3) lack of therapists in my city

I'm this position where I'm in a good enough household to make suicide not worth it but in a bad enough household to be in depression and pain and it's the worse thing ever god I hate it so much. My parents are awesome but they just don't get mental illnesses. I hate it so much and it's taking a toll on my health and my will to live"
depression,Why?,
depression,SAMe (added to SSRIs) for depression &amp; social anxiety,"I read that SAMe can improve or potentiate the functionality of an antidepressant or SSRI. I take amitriptyline 100mg at night a tricyclic antidepressant acting on serotonin noradrenaline and others.

Can I add SAMe to my antidepressant? Are there any dangerous interactions like serotonin syndrome etc? Will it potentiate my antidepressant as I don‘t feel anything from the Amitriptyline 100mg.

What are your experiences with SAMe alone or SAMe in addition to an antidepressant?"

depression,"Sometimes I want to kill myself, but not really","Actually, I don’t know what’s the point of this post so I guess it’s more of a post of my collective thoughts so it’s kind of a mess. 

I’ve always had this urge to end it all and forget about life and all it’s misery. However, i’m genuinely scared of death and I know that I wouldn’t do it even if i wanted to. Also somehow I feel that being cuddled or hugged keeps me sane and helps me feel like I can be whole again. But then again, I wouldn’t want to be in a relationship because I can’t take care of the other person emotionally as I’m too tired and but also at the same time i don’t want to share my emotional distress to someone else because I feel like a burden sometimes. So I like to be in casual relationships because it gives me the physical intimacy I need without the emotional commitment. But then sometimes I feel lonely because I do want to be loved and I want to love someone. 

Does anyone feel the same way as me?"
depression,Do I have depression?,[deleted]
depression,I don't know what to do,"I made this throwaway for a few reasons, number one, I just got out of an argument with my entire family just hours ago and spoke to my therapist about the ordeal. Needless to say, I am feeling very suicidal at the moment because of it and no one is up to help me right now. Number two, I've been wanting to reach out to people online as sort of a group therapy thing and I'm hoping it will help cope with some of the pain I am currently feeling.  


A little background about myself, I'm 19 and a NEET, not enrolled in college as of yet but recently paid off my current debt and I have plans to go during the autumn semester. I grew up in a very rocky and unstable household with my dad being an abusive drunk who would berate my mother and me with insults and beatings and with a financial situation/infidelity looming over our heads we (my mother and I) were forced to move out of our house to an apartment in the inner city with my grandparents and four cousins. Throughout the entire ordeal I was bullied in elementary school and forced to visit my father on weekends which would result in me being beat for deviating the smallest iota. I forgot my bookbag with my mother, beat, forgot to practice violin, beat, even making my father late for certain recreational activities he enjoyed would get me beat and then tongue-lashed afterwards. Because of this, I gained weight from stress eating and my father made that very known. Skip to late middle school and after begging my parents for a therapist and it being swept under the rug I was just too depressed to take school seriously anymore, this would slowly get in the way of the relationship with my mother who I was very close to and slowly make a gap between us. I would start getting beat more and more by my mother for trivial things will them all making their way back to my truancy and shotty grades, and it reached a breaking point late tenth grade year when I attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital. This made my father change but my mother seemed a lot colder after the whole experience, so much so that I remember one day I had told her that school was too strenuous because of my depression, and her response was ""why? Isn't that what anti depressants are for"" shortly after I was beaten with a stick and kicked out of my house because ""I wasn't doing the things necessary to live with her.""   


Throughout this entire situation called my life I came to understand that both of my parents were narcissistic and only wanted me to make them look better. My mother wanted me to be a grade a student but eventually this took a toll on me because her demands would be increasingly impossible especially with my mental state shot because of my parents rough divorce and my pleas for a therapist ignored, this along with the fact that she almost wouldn't allow me to vent to anyone that she didn't know or that wasn't her. My father was a classic tough guy and often made fun of me because of my affinity to scholasticism, although he supported me being a good student he wanted me to be a star athlete with the spotlight always on them. I can't keep a job because of this and in fact that's why we got in the argument to begin with, everytime I start a new job I always get sidetracked with my own progress and feel a sense of regret and anger because of my parents failure to tend to my needs when I was a child. Even though both my parents have advanced degrees and promised me that above everything they would make sure I got to college, every time the subject comes around I'm given half-assed responses on why they didn't have the money to pay the debt or don't have the money for tuition, so  much so that I had to scrap up the money to pay off my college debt; and after I did I found out that my dad bought a ring and is focusing on marriage with his mistress with my supposed college fund. I constantly feel in a state of constant downfall because I see everyone around me progressing whilst I'm stuck because of my mental state. I can't keep a job without either giving up or having work life simply take too much of a toll on me. All of this made me blow up at my Father and tell him that all of his neglect when I was a child and bad decision-making ruined me and that I couldn't take it anymore. I wish I could call my mother but all she'll do is remind me of my shortcomings and reiterate why she kicked me out to begin with. I just can't take it anymore&gt;  


Sorry for my really incoherent writing, I'm just extremely sad and needed to let this off my chest."
depression,I haven’t talked to any friends for 3 months,I stopped replying to texts from friends since December. I even changed my number. A friend showed up to my place worried but I pretended I wasn’t home and then sent him a message to completely cut off our friendship. A part of me wants to reach out to other friends I haven’t spoken to in a while but what would I even say? “Hey sorry I haven’t talked to you in months I was/still am depressed”? It’s easier to not have anyone in my life but I know it’s making things worse for me. Does anyone else feel dumb when venting or talking about their problems? I tend to trivialize my problems even though they’re obviously affecting me. It’s easier for me to not talk for some reason. It’s easier for me to not think about how my parents are dead.
depression,Lies,I keep getting lied to. I keep getting deceived. My loved ones keep lying and deceiving me and later they say. Oh we had to because you're a psycho. I'm on meds. I'm doing therapy. I'm so much under control. Nobody sees that. I live alone. I feel deceived and broken. I don't like my hobbies anymore. I don't have any friends. I work from home. So no colleagues. I feel I'm so shitty and worthless that people just manipulate and lie to me and get away from me. My eyes are heavy from crying. I feel so alone.
depression,I just need someone to give me a hug and tell me everything will be OK,
depression,I feel like an exposed nerve,"I've struggled for a decade with my depression and it has been better but recently I feel myself slipping. All i want to do is stay in bed and cry and just curl up in a ball and just try to drown out my thoughts because I just keep thinking that if this is as good as it get than what's the point ya' know?  But everyday I still go to work and smile and joke all while thinking I should just end it. I don't really have a support system. I lost a lot of friends due to growing apart pre-covid and what little I do have left I haven't talked to since august 2020 because it was just so much work to even leave the house on my days off to be near other people and even just thinking about telling my family about whats going on is making me cringe. To be honest I don't know what I'm going to do.

 I work a retail job that's high labor and constantly interacting with people that is causing so much stress my hair is falling out again, my weight is yo-yo-ing, I'm cold all the time, my legs are in constant pain and I'm pretty sure my coworkers see me as a bit of a joke (that could just be my own insecurities) but with covid and a lack of post-secondary education I don't have many options, I support my mother and pre-teen sibling with what little money I make but it's just getting to be a lot. I've taken to screaming into my jacket in the bathroom at work until it feels like i can breathe again and just going back out onto the sales floor with a fake smile because I'm trying to be better so no more self destructive coping mechanisms for me, just listening to my middle school music again to feel anything and diving into manga and fanfiction to distract myself.

Today was the worst though. It felt like just one thing after another. My first choice bus drove off as I was walking to the stop, my card got declined getting my morning coffee even after I had checked to see if I had enough the night before.  It just felt like a lot on top of my phone breaking the week before  so no music to block everything out. I feel stuck, like no matter what I do no matter how much I try to be better or do better,  I am *always always* ***always*** going to want to just kill myself.  

I've tried crying but I can't get the tears out because just hearing myself cry just makes me stop. I've tried breathing through the emotions and ended up hyper ventilating and panicking. I've tried giving myself pep talks and saying just get through today but it's always me trying to just get though another day and the days are just blending together. It feels like there's not enough time and that everything is hopeless but I have to keep going because if I don't, if I stop for even a second I don't know if I have it in me to get back up again.

tl;dr? it's been a tough time and my brain is being even more of a dumpster fire :3"

depression,They all say they are there for me but then just ignore the fact that I need help,"I am a failure. Say whatever you want, I am a failure. I play four instruments and have pretty good grades. I Also love to draw and my mother says, I have the voice of a nightingale.
I know exactly what you’re thinking. “How can you be a failure under this conditions?“ Well, it’s kind of the reason. I am good at everything. (Except sports.) Everyone knows that I’m good at everything. And if I get a bit worse my parents are disappointed. Disappointment is the worst thing you can feel that affects other people. Maybe you know the song ”silent scream“ from Damien Dawn. That is exactly what I feel. Ok, maybe I‘m not a failure, but I feel like a failure. And that’s kinda my parents‘ fault. Everything that isn’t perfect isn‘t good enough. If you disappoint a single person two times in... I dunno, a few months, this person won’t forget it and hate you until forever. Sorry if my English is bad, I am German and in 6th grade. Now in times of the pandemic, it got worse. I am alone all day long and every time, something doesn’t work, I start crying. Well, I figured something out. There are a few things you can do to stop crying. Sometimes I just burst into laughter. It’s funny how pathetic I am. My parents only want the best for me, but I keep telling myself that it’s their fault because they just won’t stop putting press on me. And then the laughter turns into tears of despair. Every day we ”plan“ everything I have to do. They don’t trust me enough to do it myself. Well, I told a few people about it. I always left my parents out. I don’t really know why. The people I told about my situation where always overwhelmed at first. Then they wanted to help me. I always said that I don’t need help. I don’t know if they could help me and I don‘t want them to feel guilty if they can’t. Ok, when I tell them, that I don’t need help, they always say, that they are always there for me. And then just forget the entire conversation. Yea, that’s really what I need. To be honest, if I‘d know how to do it without much pain, I‘d commit suicide right now. And now another song. ”Hold on“ from Chord Overcast. I don’t know if there is a single person out there that would feel that.

Well, maybe I should tell my parents about all this. But whatever you say, I won’t. I really can’t.

Goodbye and try to have a better life than me

depression,How can a blade help me?,"Since I was a kid I've been raised religiously that suicide is a sin and cutting yourself is a sin aswell but now, doesn't it kinda sound wrong? Like I've had so many times I wanted to cut and keep on questioning why is it a sin?

And other than that, every one keeps on saying that cutting won't help you while it kinda does sometimes? Like right now in this very moment I'm thinking of getting the blade of this razor and cut my hands and I know it would help.

Why? Cuz I deserve it, I'm such a bad person and I keep on failing and failing, my mother doesn't realize how stressed I am yet she puts even more pressure in me, my father been outside the country for years and I've never got the taste of father n son love, all of my friends hate me to the point where all they say is fake all they do is fake and it sounds like they r slowly getting sick of me.

Idk what to do right now, I don't have anyone to bother to text and say I need help pls stop me, but at the same time I feel like cutting is the best way to go."
depression,I'm worsening,"I think I am getting more and more severely depressed.
I have no willpower, I have no energy, I feel deeply lonely but i have no force to engage with anyone... 

My hobbies all seems dumb and a waste of time. I should be doing something better like idk studying to get my driver's licence or looking into internship to get an idea of what to do in life. 

Yet I'm stuck. Everything feels either useless or won't pay off. Im a failure and I don't succeed. And I cannot get that idea out of my head.

I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow finally. After 3 weeks. I want to ask her for medicine. I already did but she's extra cautious and want to make sure it's the good choice. I guess it's good she's careful. But i feel like all I have been doing this year is waiting. I try to push things forwards. But i have to wait. Process is so long. 

My dad doesn't understand or realize how bad things are getting for me. How dark it's getting.
 
I feel so exhausted and so worthless. I hate myself. I hate my personality, my indecisiveness. If only I had done better choices right off the bat. I wouldn't be there.

I don't know who to reach out to. I feel I have exhausted everyone around me..."

depression,"Venting, at my lowest point","Throwaway for obvious reasons but I’m so tired. 

I always act like the clown and act like nothing bothers me because no one cares. The few people I drop nuggets of info going on in my personal life don’t seem to care or judge me. 

I’ve struggled with major depression for going on 10 years with a history of self harm and I’ve been feeling on the verge of relapse. I’ve been actively suicidal again which Ive managed to have under control for a few years but this year is breaking me.

This year has been the worst of my life. My parent was diagnosed with colon cancer this year, which took my great uncle last year after chemo and being cleared, my dog, whom has gotten me through the worst times of my life who genuinely is my best friend was disgnosed with g.I. Lymphoma a few days ago after years of misc health issues most vets brushed off as food allergies. I have to put my dog down in the next few days and it’s genuinely breaking me. 

On top of that, I am a student and I’ve been struggling insanely this semester and I literally cannot fail or get below a C in any of my classes this semester or I’m no longer qualified for FAFSA or student loans because I am reaching the hour limit from getting my associates degree  (which I paid out of pocket myself working full time when I was younger) and switching majors while in University. I had a big test today that I tried studying for but I’ve been unable to focus due to the news of my dog and trying to cope and I completely bombed it. 

On top of that, I’ve been having dreams about an abortion one of my exes had a few years ago that I didn’t want to go through with that I feel like I never worked through. 

I really feel at my breaking point and the only thing that’s gotten me through all of my rough times was my dog. I genuinely feel no one cares and this may be it for me and I really just need to vent"
depression,Don’t know what to do.,"I’ve been having a rough couple of nights, been a long time since I had trouble sleeping, but this nights there’s a memory I can’t shake off my mind.

I can’t forget the look in my father’s eyes the last time I saw him, he was leaving the house, with my mom and my sisters, they asked me if I was coming, I said no, “the car is going to be full if I go, it’s better if I stay”.

I was looking at the front door as they were leaving, he was last, he turn around and he gave me a look, his eyes we’re telling me something, I wasn’t sure what it was, I shook it off, if only I had known that that look was his goodbye.
He’s gone and now everything is different but nothing is, it feels so bizarre, I mean, why is it so mundane, why is it so normal, life keeps going and so do I but it’s not the same.
I wasn’t even able to say goodbye, he passed away some months ago due to covid and I don’t know how to feel, I don’t know what I feel, sometimes I forget, sometimes he’s always in my mind, sometimes everything is numb and I just don’t know where I’m going, I don’t know where my life is gonna go from here, I don’t know what to study, I don’t know what career I should follow, I feel truly lost.

I’m sorry if this is out of place or poorly written, it’s my first time posting something and I don’t really know what I’m doing, just wanted to get this out of my chest."
depression,Feeling of worthless and that I’ve lost my self,"I feel so drained, worthless. I keep trying to put my energy into speaking to people but I just want to lock my self away and not have contact. I’m finding so hard to feel like my self, in a way I feel de attached and hollo. I feel like putting my energy into things is worthless and I’m not going forward. I’ll never move forward. I don’t even have the energy to try and buy my self something ( retail therapy often helps). I just feel this sense of hopelessness. 
Everything seems like such a task. I keep over thinking, do I seem lazy because I’m not doing anything, am I failure. It’s all getting to much 
- dyslexic so sorry for any errors"
depression,One good day followed by 2 or more bad days.,"This can’t just be me?!? I’ll have a decent day one day and then the day after I’m so depressed I can’t get out of bed. This goes on until I feel a little better and then bam! repeat!!! I get zero to minimal sleep for the “good” days and then 14 or so hrs of sleep the bad days. 

I recently got diagnosed (45m) with OCD, ADHD and I have a dopamine shortage. I knew I had OCD all along but the others were a bit surprising. After getting diagnosed the above circumstances started happening. I’ve always had a problem with sleep but not like this. I’m not working, that’s not helping I’m sure. The last 12 months or so have been extremely difficult so I’m sure that’s making it worse too. Why, though, does it seem that since I was diagnosed, it got way worse? It’s 5:35 am and I’m up. Still. Pretty soon I’m just going to not even try to sleep and see what happens.🤷🏼‍♂️"

Nothing can make me happy i think, but if I'm with a friend or I'm doing a cool thing i kinda get less sad, but I'm still a bit sad I think. And because of the covid it depresses me, I'm sick of it, already that I don't go outside too much, that I don't have a lot of people to talk so I don't talk to too many people and there's many others thing that i can possibly forget, the situation is difficult. And i have to choose a job for my orientation but i don't know what, i feel that i'm very bad for everything in my life. I'm want to try nofap but i loose everyday, i want to nofap, but in my head i say to me ""that's not a bad thing, and anyway my life s--ks"". At age 8 that was the first time I've seen porn, and i search things like ""n-ked woman"" and now at 14 years old i m-st-rbate once every day... And a few months ago i keep watching some sissy hypno. when I'm not excited those videos repugnated me, but now recently i'm staring to like it... But sometimes i can avoid those weird fantasies. At first it was trans women now i start to fantasize about men's d---, yet it repugnated me a few years ago. So i think i said everything, i hope someone can help... And if you have questions precisions or anything don't hesitate to ask me.

Edit : I also have a detachment from school, i don't want to learn or anything. Every morning when i wake up I'm tired and i can't stare at someone in the eyes too long (if it's a video i can but not in real life) like it's not because I'm shy (for girls yes i think, because i don't talk to them a lot, i don't know why but in my school i think I'm the guy who talk the less to a girl) but i feel a weird thing i don't know how to say it"
depression,Feeling quite alone,When you're not really being shown love and it seems like whatever you say is of no matter to the other person unless it has to do with them. makes one feel unloved.

depression,Shall I continue someone who won't get help?,"Hello there!

So, I finally found someone great to date. We've been seeing each other for about a month now. I'm in love. He's not perfect, there are things that bother me about him, but overall he's a thoughtful and kind human being. I like being with him. We go for walks with his dog, we watch movies, we read books together and the sex is awesome! However, he has also told me about his past. His father died when he was a kid and his mother has always been emotionally unavailable. That's why he is struggling with identifying and communicating his feelings, which is bad for him and so affects me and our relationship negatively. I go to therapy and told him, he should go too, but he is too afraid. Our conversation always lead to the conclusion, he should see a therapist. I don't want to bother and control him by talking about therapy all the time, but I don't want to minimize his depression (he has self diagnosed himself) either. He says I make him happy, but he doesn't really know what happiness feels like. He learned to function, to think, not to feel, ask for help and so on. I want to continue seeing him, maybe I want to have a romantic relationship with him, but I don't know if this is working, if he won't see a therapist. What am I supposed to do? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation, maybe on the other side of the equation? I would really appreciate your thoughts.

Thank you for reading this!

depression,wasting time,"so my cat was sleeping on my legs as I lied on my side watching a show. I was gently petting her and after a while she bites me. so I say something and stop and put my hand down. she continues to try to bite my hand and I keep pushing her away. she's usually pretty sweet but does have a bit of an attitude which comes out rarely. it escalated to her becoming more aggressive me so I kicked her out of the room.

even my cat doesn't like me and I'm her favourite.

then I got really sad because i feel unwanted and used, amongst a laundry list of other things. I'm so tired of all of this. exhausted. depleted. and I'm lonely. so fucking lonely.this is stupid"

I feel worthless and dead all the time, can anyone give me any advice?"
depression,I need to vent about my life,"Hi everyone,

I'm not familiar with making that kind of post, but I feel like I need to vent and tell someone what I feel. Forgive me if that post looks a little chaotic I'm not really sure about what I will say.

I've been suffering from depression 3 years ago and managed to deal with it after finding a girlfriend. However, life is what it is and we broke up some month ago after she cheated on me for more than a year.

I've never been really self-confident but it had make it worse.

Since I've just spiral down in depression again. I hate my school, I hate my job, wich I took to afford to pay a rent to live together with what is now my ex..., and on top of that a f*****g hate myself. I've started to lost more and more interest in what was my hobby and reach a point where I now just feel sad or empty.

Sometimes I feel better, sometimes I pretend I feel better, but must of the times it's just sadness. I feel ashamed or guilty for evryone I do. I lie to myself that it will be better, but deep down I know it will not.

I have some friend but... If I don't do the first step they won't... Sometimes I feel I'm just a disturbance for them

I don't feel I have a place in this world, I hate everything peoples of my generations tends to like. I feel that everyone is better than me.

I don't see a point to live anymore. But I don't want to end myself, I'm just to coward for that. Even that I feel like i will fail... I just wait that the day end, and the next one to come.

Damn even for that post I feel shame. Sorry if I bother you. And sorry for my english that might be as broken as my life.

Hope you will have a great day. Thanks for reading my testimony"
depression,“are you okay”,"i appreciate the effort to ask me if i’m alright but sometimes solitude is all i really want. and it only strokes your ego when you ask just to make yourself feel involved and concerned with my personal life. it’s that or i’m really just the bad guy. i’ve never been this depressed since i was 13, but my school is a manifestation for my depressive episodes, where the people there think their own problems override others’ and immediately shut them down just to make everything about themselves. it’s fucking toxic, it’s no longer an avenue for us to unload our problems. i’m at a point where i wouldn’t budge or make a conscious effort to run away to safety if a car were speeding towards me."

I hate my life, I hardly see or speak to anyone. I sit in my room all day doing nothing productive. I hardly shower or change clothes and my room is so messy. At school I've become the weird quiet kid and hardly anyone speaks to me anymore and I really don't want to go back there. I hate everything about myself.

So I decided to take it seriously and wanted (still want) to be a professional player because I love to do it. I started playing more and more and I improved really fast. After a few months the bad things started. I started underperforming in the game, every day I get worse and worse. I got more stressful day by day. I'm anxious when I play and tilt really easily. Yeah. I should stop doing it... but it's not that easy. The temptation to play is high, because I sit front of the computer every day (online school). Since this ""slump"" started I lost my feelings (arguing with gf, feeling nothing about anything). My footbal performance is getting worse and worse... My motivation to do anything is getting worse... I feel down every day, doesn't want to go out, having 0 energy... I have to find a solution. I don't want ending the ""esport"" carreer, but I don't want to depend on it. I want serious answers because it's getting worse :(

depression,Why should I fight,"Everything in the past couple of months have gone to shit with life, I lost my close friend group 2 months ago which just hurts so much since I knew these guys for 6 years but soon as the “leader” didn’t want to be friends with me anymore everyone else left and haven’t talked to me which is just dog shit like 6 years of being friends just to be ignored and not cared about anymore. 

The person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with just wants to be friends which is killing me inside, I love her so much and maybe I just don’t deserve her as I’ve seemed to bring her pain even though I’ve been doing what’s right it still brought too much pain. I don’t want to be without her and I can feel it in my soul that she is the one no matter what people tell me.

My mother talks about killing her self and if she had a gun she would, It’s like I have to take care of her along with myself and Its hard to handle because I see how much pain she is in from what she goes through and being there for me, my brother doesn’t do anything or talk to her much I’m the only one doing something about it.

I feel like I’m not good enough for anyone, I try and try to work things out but it’s never enough for anyone. Everyone is distant and cold with me, I should’ve ended it years ago when I was about to. There is so much shit going on and I just can’t handle it anymore, therapy doesn’t work, medications don’t work. No matter what I do it is not enough and honestly I don’t know why I’m writing this because why would a bunch of strangers give a fuck.

It’s like the universe is wanting me to kill myself at this point, I’m at rock bottom and I am lost. I can’t handle the silent screaming in my head. I can’t continue on with this shit for years to come, I’ve heard of people in their 40’s and 50’s going through it since a kid. That just makes me want to end it even more."
depression,Anger as a symptom of depression need to be recognized more,"Depression isn’t just being depressed all the time. Anger and feeling numb is also a big part of it. Before I was diagnosed, I was a lot to handle. I would get angry for no reason and destroyed my things as an ineffective coping mechanism. I even went as far as assaulting my mom once but luckily, I have a mother who was nice enough to not press charges and encouraged me to go into therapy. I now know better ways to handle my anger. Of course most angry people arent depressed (some people are just miserable) but depressed people are often angry. Also I’m not excusing my past actions I just did what I did and I can’t take it back"

He’s one of the few things that kept me anchored the past few years, with all of the things that I’ve gone through. He was a birthday gift. I don’t know what I’m gonna do now that he’ll be gone. I’ll probably try to kill myself again once it happens and I lose what little control I have left. Not sure why I’m really posting this. I hope you all are doing better than I am right now…"

I moved to another school 3 years ago, and I have lost every single friend I had since. I felt like I was being left behind, forgotten by the people that I care about, reviving old memories while everyone else were truly living their lives. And indeed all of them stopped talking to me. The last person I used to talked to was my all life best friend, and because of fearing that I would lose her, I ended up losing her, I got scared that she would replace me for someone else, like everyone had done before, and pushed her away, created problems where there were none and I lost her. And I feel a fucking idiot. I had gone through months of depression, then recovered back from it, and fallen again. And now I feel like I’m completely empty. I don’t give a shit about anything. I can’t get sad, I can’t get happy. I can’t feel, only see how time passes in front of me, day after day, the same shitty cycle.

depression,I just want someone to hold me,"My life has been in a downward spiral ever since I got out of college and I'm at one of the lowest points in my life. I can't find a job, I haven't any luck with dating, and I have almost no friends. The thing I miss the most about my life before was having people near that cared about me, people I could talk to about the deeper parts of life and be emotionally vulnerable to. It's been years since I've been actually happy and until recently I was managing well enough. I would maybe have a bad day every few months, but it's such a constant weight that I just feel numb. The emotional strain has me constantly feeling void of energy and I can't even sleep properly. My body let's me rest for maybe four hours before I'm awake and suffering.

I just so badly want someone to hug me and tell me things will be okay, because even it won't be it's still nice to hear. I just want to be connected again, I want to feel whole. I don't want to feel like this anymore, why is it so hard just to be happy?"

depression,Don’t know how long I can wait,"Doctor refused to give me bupropion and referred me to psychiatrist. Psychiatrists all have wait time of like 2-weeks to a month. Don’t know how Much longer I can wait. 

I’m in agony. I have to confront my demons every day seeing the guy who sexually assaulted me at school. I need medication so badly. Will only take bupropion because it’s the only one which doesn’t cause weight gain. 

Don’t know how I’m going to make it to getting the medication finally."

depression,"I can't do anything, no motivation to live","Im in the last year of highschool, there's just 4 months left till the baccalaureate.Its just an exam, but if I dont pass and get the diploma I wont be taken seriously by anyone in society and wont't be hired anywhere.I've been struggling with depression and fear of death for 2 years already.I dont know what to do, im goint to therapy, its the second therapist already and it doesn't help much.I just can't get out of bed, it's like I dont wanna wake up.No matter how many alarms I set the night before, no matter how much motivation I have the night before.I just can't get out of bed.Even if I do get up because my parentd ask me to mop the floor or something, I still remain tired and my whole body hurts and I go back to bed and fall asleep.I started going to gym with a few friends early in the morning before school, we motivate each other, but we still only go once every other day, so in the break days I still sleep till 12 p.m.It doesn't matter for me in the morning that I have online classes, the house could be on fire and I still wouldn't get up.Even if I'm awake I just sit in bed and watch youtube or something.

The biggest problem is that I have to learn for the exams, it's history, english, romanian and geography, and even if I wouldn't have this exam, I'd still love to learn more history and geography, but I can't.I can't read without my thoughts shifting to something else, I even read while thinking to something else without realising, even if I love the subject, if I see a lot of text, or that there's a lot of work to do my brain automatically skips that task.And I forget things really easily and I can't focus, I hate myself for that because I wanna be a better version of myself, a version that thinks quick, can take decisions, reads a lot, can think for itself and has it's own opinions and stuff, and I just can't and I hate myself for that, I really don't know what to do anymore

Any advice would be good"

And I don't want any of it, and I don't know why.","It's been three years since my last post here.  I thought I beat it.  I thought I finally won.  But every victory was pyrrhic.  It doesn't matter what I do, or what accolades I accrue, or which people I bring into my life.  None if it adds to my happiness.  Nothing I've gained has given me any worth.  Each and every small token of joy I've collected only serves to emphasize how empty I am.  This is not a call for help, and nor is it a eulogy.  This is simply an admission of defeat.

If life were a motion picture soundtrack, then this would be my last line."

depression,Post title (required),"I’ve had many stages in my life so far with various states to define them. Stages of sadness, stages of anger, stages of love, stages of hope and stages of hopelessness. The most painful period was my stage of nothing.

My stage of nothing is quite simple; I felt nothing, and it was excruciating. I used to think that feeling nothing would be better than feeling sad, but I was misled. Things nosedived with the terrifying moment of looking into the mirror and seeing something I couldn’t recognize, staring back into my eyes with a cold, dead stare. 

That day I started drafting my four suicide notes (one of sorries and reason, one of thank yous, one of ramblings and one of self-anger) and preparing myself for the deed. I was already used to getting a high feeling from self strangulation, so it wasn’t a huge task. I even laid out a method and symbolism in it.

I am still here because someone came into my life, or maybe I came into theirs, je ne sais pas. Both of us had our baggage. I felt crippling nothingness and she felt the effects of abuse at the hands of others.

We had known about each other for years, but never became even as much as acquaintances. Alas, I found myself in her dms after she posted a question story about other’s mental ailments, and we started talking at around 5 pm. We talked about many things, mostly our mental health, and we eventually became incredibly open to each other and shared the roots of how we were. Before I knew it, it was 2 am and I was tired, emotional and needed to sleep. 

She understood so much about me and I understood so much about her. I’d show her my drawings and she’d read me her poetry, and we’d talk about our problems and support each other. That is what helped me survive through that Christmas: a solid friend. Without her, I’d be dead. I’d be another casualty to the mind.

Please always remember, our brains are incredibly complicated, as they would need to be for the complexity of humans. The drawback is that dealing with the mind is not a one person job. It always needs outer support. 

The good support can be found if you look for it and are willing to be mutual with the support. If anything, look for other people to support. Someone in need can often support you back, benefiting everyone."
depression,I hate myself,I hate how cringy I am. I hate what a loser I am. I hate how I'm filled with self-pity. Lazy. I don't know how to fix myself. I don't know how to deal with my life. I just can't. I'm not made for this world. I got everything handed to me and I ruined it all.

depression,I don’t think I’m good at socializing.,"I’m concise, I explain myself well when topics are brought up. But I don’t know how to carry a conversation with new people. It bothers me. At the end of the day I know I’m not an engaging conversationalist and it effectively cuts off any potential new friends or connections I could have had if I knew how to feign enough interest in someone. 

Consequently I know my Friend isn’t interested in my day or what I want to rant about either. I always get the feeling that she’s there but isn’t listening. It gets pretty lonely talking to yourself with someone else right there. Don’t get me wrong she has good intentions. She’ll stay on the phone with me if I had a bad day, she just doesn’t really care about the topics I bring up. 

Socializing becomes exhausting. I’m not very confident about making new connections. When I was unemployed a year ago I literally didn’t speak for 2 months. When I got a job I had to work on getting volume back in my voice because of it. I know it’s bad. If people don’t reach out to me I don’t talk. I recognize that it isn’t healthy. But I feel so drained when I make efforts to reach out and I’m not really heard. So I don’t."
depression,The Heaviness of Depression,"Being 42 sucks. Being 42 and living in Detroit. Being 42, living in Detroit, and in the middle of a pandemic. Wait. Add on continuous unnecessary drama. Drama at home, traveling to work, at work, the cycle goes on. The arcades are my ONLY source of happiness in real life... they were closed for months and I had struggled with myself. They are open now, but I can only get to go on Wednesdays. Once I leave from the arcade, things start going down slowly and by Friday the mood goes south, fast. 5 hours at work will feel like 9 and even worse when there are days with a lot of heaviness in me.

Online: Some days are okay but most are meh. Maybe because I take roleplaying to heart, deeply. When you feel like crap in real life sometimes you take the RP world to heart, and when things go wrong there, my mood tanks to the cellar in a heartbeat. It’s even worse when you sleep on it, and you have to work through the visions and all.

During a few of those tanked days I had a lot of bad visions. One was when the I-75 bridge over the Rouge River collapsed, and I was falling to my doom. The other was me standing on Evergreen Road, at the bridge over the Northwestern Freeway, looking down. I had the vision of me falling down on the freeway. Somehow I shook my head and went onward.

I’ve had a lot of feelings of being worthless. They go away with days at the arcade, easy. Problem is: very few are open, I only get one day, and it’s hard to keep the positive vibes beyond the arcade. Roleplaying doesn’t help too much unless I’m some high level magical being who can shoot lasers and destroy enemies. Hence I used to watch a lot of anime and superhero movies, now I can’t. Then RP partners who can bring such adventures are literally as hard as getting a Royal Flush in Texas Hold ‘Em.

Most times I keep a lot of this to myself because of course I’m in the land of toxic positivity: you know, the “man up” mentality... or the “try other things” thing: which is kinda ironic seeing it is Detroit - any civil form of entertainment is just the same rate as finding that Hold ‘Em Royal Flush.

Sometimes I wonder."
depression,Wow today sucks heh :),"I relapsed really hard today and yesterday, I have cuts all over my body, thighs, arms,neck, face, there’s a boy I text, he asked to see my cuts so I showed him and he said I was crazy and no wonder my mother treats me badly for doing it, I told him he hurt my feelings back and forth ended up having a panic attack and then he ask me to forgive him I talk to my other friend he also says I’m weird and scary, I lash out, someone texts me suddenly... someone I don’t talk to at all really, claims they love me and want me, I’m covered in blood hyperventilating while all of this is happening... mean while my mom is shot up on Ketamine downstairs

God I could just kill her. Please don't let her talk to the new boy again. I’m getting so dizzy now. I just want him to be mine but I can’t confront him.

depression,Over the ledge of depressive anhedonia and misanthropy,"I’ve been severely depressed, daydreaming leaving the ol mortal coil since I was 9. It’s been almost 20 years. I’ve failed spectacularly in all areas I’ve wasted my time in, especially art, which has had all meaning and pleasure siphoned from it and exists only as a compulsion now. I’ve got no other way of understanding or digesting anything and if I could trade every skill related to making art or music for anything materially valuable to someone else, I would in a second. It’s hell. Just making art that is worthless to the people in your life you want to understand you. The equivalent is speaking a language nobody else will ever speak. Life isn’t a series of memories of diminishing feelings of love or wistful yearning for a time when I felt loved, upon reflection my life is a long period of holding out and waiting to experience that. I believe I’m incapable of being loved and a fundamental piece of my own understanding of myself is that I will never be worth loving. I’ve known this since I’ve been capable of forming a self image. I am at the core of all things broken, a liar, and undeserving of life. I am at a point in my thinking that ending my own life would be the best possible use of or contribution I can give with my existence"

depression,hi,"hi. i feel really guilty and regretful after having vented to friends, so i thought maybe making a throwaway and talking about things here could fix that if you guys don’t mind. it is always hard being able to piece my thoughts together, and i always feel like i fall short in saying what i really feel, because i were to type what i felt it would go on forever and no one would read it. i’m not sure what makes me feel any different about this honestly. i’m currently in high school and i sleep through every class. i don’t have any motivation to attend or do any of my work and all of my grades are slipping faster than i can catch them. my friends don’t really talk to me and/or seem interested in talking to me. my family has always had a hard time liking me and after having been sexually abused by my father and having my mother witness it and say nothing, i don’t even really mind but i still feel like i’m missing something everyone else has if that makes sense. even after my first suicide attempt and the cops being called, the next day i was only called weak and was blamed for still carrying the trauma i have today and not growing up. i’ve stopped self harming, but that’s only because my girlfriend threatened to leave me if i cut myself again. speaking of which, my relationship with her is falling apart and she told me she’s losing feelings for me but is trying to stick around for my sake. i feel like such a burden this way but i can’t bare the thought of losing her regardless. i feel like everyone in my life is disappearing again, and having been shut out from the world and all my friends for a total of 5 years by my parents, i’m really scared. i feel like i have nowhere to go and the inevitability of my parents kicking me out when i turn 18 in 4 months is scaring the shit out of me. i just sleep all day and starve myself and i don’t even hate that fact. i just hate how i feel everyday and i can’t hide it anymore. i’m sorry this was so long. i still feel like i didn’t say everything but who even cares. thank you"

depression,The worthless piece of dirt is back!,"(Day 1 of posting)

Yeah, I doubt anyone here even cares. Life has just gotten really weird and I couldn’t quite find the time to start this all up again.

Anyways, a lot has happened since my last post. Today was my birthday. I got a new pair of headphones, some shelves for my room, and some quality talking behind my back about how I’m an asshole.

I know this is such a small thing to whine about but the cake was pretty garbage too. I don’t know what the bakery did but the frosting was like water. I guess the cake kind of represented how I felt after hearing my parents talk about me like that on my birthday. Completely deflated.

Oh, and there’s this fear lingering in the back of my head that my crush might die. She got sick a few days back and hasn’t been doing super great. I just can’t get over this fear that she could just up and die. What would I even do? I might just end it all and kill myself and join her if that happens.

Everything’s just been so hard, I starting to give up what little hope I’m clinging too. Through all of what I’m going though I don’t even really have friends to talk to. None of them have responded to my messages. It’s starting to feel like I’m just invisible. I’m starting to feel like I should just accept that and make myself disappear from the face of this awful planet."
depression,So confused about my thoughts,"I've been in a depressive slump the past month or so and my ocd has been playing up as well. I have depression and anxiety diagnosed and undiagnosed OCD. However over the past couple weeks I have been finding myself googling how to induce psychosis/schizophrenia etc. I have no clue why I have found the need to compulsively google these as I don't believe there is anything that has triggered me to do so. By no means am I trying to belittle or make light of those who do suffer from these conditions. I am just unable to not search them otherwise it will be the only thing I can think about until I do. Do you have any recommendations besides going to the ED/GP/Psychologist. I'm due to see a psychiatrist in the next week or so (stupid me forgot to add the date into my calendar). I've also had the occasional intrusive thought of going on a destructive frenzy and just break a lot of stuff that isn't mine and usually in a public setting such as a shopping centre. I don't know how long I can trust myself to stay safe, I have a partner that is supportive but she also has her own mental battles she is going through and I don't want to make things worse for her. 

Cheers in advance for any advice"

It’s 2 am and guess what? It’s another sleepless weeknight, you lay in bed scrolling through your favorite social media app to distract yourself from your own thoughts. Time is winding down and you know sooner or later you’ll have to shut that phone off and descend into the darkness of your own mind. As you watch that one last video you get a sinking feeling of dread, you know what’s coming. As you set those alarms and take one last look at the time, you sigh a deep sigh and roll over to the other side of the bed. As soon as your eyes shut, thoughts come racing into your head, it’s almost instinctive at this point. Then comes the feeling you’re all too familiar with hits you like a bus. The feeling of a knot being slowly tightened in the pit of your stomach and seems to worsen with every passing second. You toss and turn but with each movement, you only make it get worse and worse, you’re almost at a breaking point. There’s a battlefield roaring within your head and your thoughts are racing.

“What am I doing” “am I enough” “why am I such a piece of shit” “She would be better without me” “How many mistakes have you made? ” “People shouldn’t trust me” “I don’t trust me” “ Have I really changed?” “Am I going to hurt her?” “Are my parents proud of me?”

You think to yourself, even more, it runs deeper than that, you’ve blocked out the trama that’s haunted your past. But guess what? It’s back. You feel worthless, used, and not worthy to be where you are today. It’s been another hour 3 am now, you have to be up in 6 hours, but you know your mind won’t guide you to the paradise of dreams you long for. You’ve had enough, you can’t take it anymore, you want to let everything out, all of the emotions and tears you know you feel, but nothing comes. All that comes is a dead, blank stare shooting from your eyes, it’s like staring at your own grave at this point. You know you don’t want to die, it’s the last thing you want. You know the people you care about would be shattered, and plus you don’t want to miss out on your future. You’ve got sweet plans! But the sweet satisfaction of finally resting sounds appealing, no stress, no anxiety, no worries.

As you lay there and stare blankly into the darkness that has swept your room, you realize that there’s nothing you can do to fix this. Out of anger, you scratch your forearm as hard as you can but as the pain explodes like a firecracker, you forget about your thoughts and that never-ending tightening knot in your stomach. You shoot up and realize this, but as quickly as the knot faded and your mind was at rest, it returns. So out of curiosity you try it again you scratch deep leaving red marks running up and down your forearm and you chuckle to yourself. Is this how I fix myself? You can feel the knot loosening ever so slowly every time you drag your nails deeper into your skin. Your mindset isn’t “you deserve this for being shitty” You do it because while that pain is surging through your arm, it causes you to forget about the warfare booming through your head and that never-ending knot that won’t go away. The only thing you can focus on is the pain, the very same pain you used to run to your mom crying about when you cut your knee. You describe the feeling as walking into a cold AC room during the blazing heat of the summer. Sounds nice right!

But now It’s 4 am, you’ve calmed down and your mind has slowed. Tiredness has overwhelmed your body, but your brain isn’t ready to power down yet. A thought crosses your mind lying there, “What if my nails aren’t enough?” “What if I need something more?” You quickly disregard this thought as you think “Well, I’ll get there when I get there, then I’ll figure it out” You know this is a bad habit but it’s the only solution you can think of.

Then out of nowhere, you fall asleep, you’re not sure how you fell asleep but it’s morning! The bags under your eyes seem twice as dark compared to the previous day but you tell yourself. “It’s okay!” “Another day another dollar” You don’t even think twice about what took place the night before, it’s all too natural. You use people and your phone as distractions during the day, nothing about the night before crosses your mind, you bury it deep inside yourself and you act as if life’s great! You’re cracking jokes and trying to impress the people around you so just maybe, they don’t see how truly broken your mind is.

Then the cycle continues"

depression,I did something weird,"Okay so lately I’ve been having a hard time with my depression and I’ve been having these “attacks” where I’m overwhelmed by all of my feelings, I feel extremely frustrated and helpless and self hateful and have no control of my thoughts. 

A couple of days ago it happened, after a whole week of not feeling as depressed as I did before. But in this “attack” I did something really weird.
It started with me having these thoughts that maybe I faked my depression this whole time because I’m just lazy and don’t want to deal with my problems so I just convince myself that I’m depressed to have a good excuse for not doing anything (my family said something like that about me before and it got to me I guess). 
I also felt like I was faking it because until a week ago I really believed I’m capable of killing myself but then I doubted it because if I really wanted to then why haven’t I done it already?

Then for like 30 minutes I felt really bad and disgusted with myself and I started organizing my drawer that’s been messy for months to prove myself that I can do it and I’m not really depressed just a lazy loser. I did it so aggressively and in tears. It was so weird and and I felt psychotic. 
I also felt super numb that week to a level where I wanted to have an anxiety attack just to feel something cause I felt like I was going crazy, even tho I hate anxiety attacks so much. Even self harm wasn’t helpful anymore.
Then I had a weird urge to stuck something into the electrical outlet next to me. So I took a pair of tweezers and did it.
There was a buzzing noise and some sparks and the electricity in my whole house shut down.
I felt nothing in my body tho. 
It all happened so fast and I felt like I had no control over myself and my actions.
My family was confused of why all of a sudden the lights and everything turned off and I just acted like I had no idea how it happened. They were mad at my sister because they thought she did something to cause a circuit. I felt so guilty and ashamed of this whole situation and still do. I’m ridiculous.  

This incident proved me that I am indeed depressed cause no mentally healthy person feels so insecure, helpless, and fucking sick.

Has anyone else ever had a similar experience? Or maybe has an idea of what might have caused me to do this?"
depression,Will racing thoughts go away in time?," 

Hi, i have mild anxiety for about a year. I was used to sleep with headphones listening music, but recently i started sleeping without them, and i find quite big problem for me.

Racing thoughts...

When i lying down and trying to sleep, i hear in my mind random shards of conversations. I cant properly concentrate at something, all i can think of are that shards of random voices...

Will this goes away in time? Or atleast when i get rid of anxiety (i am willing to do anything for it)

Do i have hope?

Thank you very much for andswers"
depression,Do not disturb,"I’ll normally write this is my journal for my eyes only, but I’m currently on a train heading south-west from London, not sure where. I hopped on the first train that came into the station.

The last month was extremely overwhelming. I used to have panic attacks in my first years of uni 8 years ago, now I just live in perpetual, full-blown panic mode. My grandmother, the woman who raised me and the only real family I have had an emergency operation and I was preparing for the worst, not even daring to hope she’d wake up (that’s what the doctors told me). To put it shortly, she did wake up, and is home now, frail, barely surviving. I couldn’t afford to take time off work (I work for myself) so I just went on auto pilot for the past 3 weeks. It was painful to work and concentrate with the perpetual pit in my stomach about my grandma. My work is very demanding. I am also renovating an old house that’s causing more problems than I ever signed up for. If there’s such a thing as high functioning depression, this is it. 

Today I couldn’t take it anymore. My anxiety, responsibilities, sadness and exhaustion got the better of me and I left my partner in our home mid-conversation and headed to the station. I just feel like putting up a do not disturb sign on my life indefinitely. I want to be alone, I want to leave everything behind, I want people to not call me and forget I ever existed. It hurts that I can’t be a good wife, a good granddaughter, a good entrepreneur, a good friend. But I just can’t. I feel exhausted. I feel like I failed everyone and I am not as strong as I believed I was. I want to heal from this but I don’t know how."

depression,I bought morphine. Again.,"Last year, when I hit one of my lowest points in life, I bought a lethal dose of morphine to just end it finally. I kept it next to my bed and, as weird as it sounds, it helped me. I kept delaying my suicide, since it provided me a sense of comfort and I could always just take it and kill myself if things got any worse. I stopped caring so much about what would happen if I did something wrong. I stopped caring if people think I'm weird. None of this mattered, because I could always easily kill myself. At some point I even threw the morphine away. 

But life always finds a way. Covid struck, both parents got cancer (although dad's is 90+% curable, mom's is 40-50%) and something inside me broke. I became unable to talk to people irl(unless forced). Lost almost all my friends because of it. My physical and mental health got progressively worse, some of my close ones died to suicide and above all, I just lost any interest in anything. I don't remember most of the day because I became a shut-in and almost every day looks the same. Time just slips through my fingers. I feel like august was last week. Yesterday, I prepared my goodbye messages and bought morphine again. 

Wish me luck, guys."

depression,"Every time I switch, I get asked if the new meds are working. I don't know how to tell.","I have been diagnosed with depression for over 8 years. Initially I was told it was teenage hormones and once I got out of high school I'd be fine. Surprise, not the case.

I've been on several different antidepressants, both SSRIs and SNRIs, and every time I switch my doctor asks me the dreaded question: Is it working?

And I never know. And he says that if I can't tell, then it's not working. 

But I've just recently switched again, and I am just so lost. I'm taking way too many classes, too many to hold a job and at the same time I'm crushed because I'm running out of money. And it's got me wondering because obviously taking medication can't fix those issues. It can't make my school load less, or make me win the lottery. It can't fix any of the things that are often responsible for me feeling so down. So I'm baffled. How is any antidepressant ever supposed to work? It can't take away the parts of life that are hard. So what am I supposed to say when the doctor asks if it's working? I don't know. Because I have these moments where I feel happier and more outspoken, and then I still have these depressive episodes, often triggered by school or other aspects of life that aren't going to go away just because I'm taking medication. Is that just life? At what point do I give up and just say ""yeah, this med is working,"" and accept that I'll always be like this.

depression,Maybe I can be encouraging,"I’ve had depression my whole life. I’m still depressed, but things are different. 

Most people will hate what I am about to say. But the only thing that helped me overcome the sever depressive state that I was in, was me learning to love myself. Learning to deal with the fact and idea that you are going to make mistakes, but having enough faith in yourself to say that everything you do isn’t a mistake. 

Find a little flame of your life that you love and grow it. And if anybody had a problem with that, fuck them. This is your life, live it for you! 

Enjoy! Love yourself and do what you want. And don’t you dare ever feel guilty for being yourself."
depression,Does having depression also affect your love life?,"I just had a new boyfriend for only 2 months, at first it was fun and all but now I feel empty again. This makes me feel really guilty because I know he likes me very much, and  I still have affection towards him, but now I'm kinda tired and bored with the relationship, just like how I feel about everything else in my life. My previous relationship also end after 6 months and I was the one who broke up first because of the same reason: I don't feel anything anymore. They both did nothing wrong, they try to cheer me up, take me out whenever they have time, play games with me and everything. Sadly I just no longer have the energy to keep being with them and pretending to be the perfect girlfriend, because after a while it becomes a responsibility and stresses me out. I really hope this is not me being an asshole, if it's just the depression then at least I have hope that it can still be cured and I may enjoy love and life one day.

But apathy is a horrible coping method. I can't open up to myself, or anyone. I only cry, and I cry, but I feel so empty when I'm finished. I'm slowly fading away, that's what it feels like.

I shouldn't have to cope with what happened to me. But feeling nothing, then immediately going to emotional overload, and back to apathetic is no way to live.

If anyone has any advice to help me that'd be great."
depression,depression rant,"hey yeah i dont really know what im doing i just need to fucking get some stuff off my chest.

im 17 in my last year of high school and ready for it to end, ive been dealing with this shit for so fucking long i dont remember what it is to be normal

ive given up, i failed my assignment and i realised i just didnt care about anything, ive always been a bit nihilistic and joked about not caring but i feel like its fully hit me how much i dont give a shit about anything.

when i told my mum she was like 'well what if you cant get into uni etc.' and i just cant even think of myself living that long and i can barely process anything that happens.

the thought of getting up and going about my day just haunts me and thinking of anything is so hard it takes so much to just think about anything.

i just want everything to stop and have a rest, i want everything to end and i know i wont live long and it makes me so sad that i have to keep waking up each say and go through this bullshit everyday.

i just want to know how a normal person feels just for one day, if they look to the future with hope and dont feel like there is this weight being dragged around everywhere.

i feel like i cant do anything, i have depression, anxiety,  adhd and probably a shit ton of other problems because my brain is fucked and i feel so useless because people in class do shit and get work done and have stuff sorted out and ive just been in this hole for so long i dont see myself ever getting out.

and i feel so guilty because i have such a privileged life, i have good parents and have support and live in a nice area but i just feel so fucking depressed and i feel like i cant go on for much longer.

my plans for the future are go on a gap year get fucked up and hopefully overdose and/or kill myself soon after so i dont have to deal with life.

writing this made me realise how much i am hoping that i fucking overdose one day on some shady drug i bought.

and i dont even care that ive given up, ive always thought life is fucking meaningless and shit and i just moved on but i dont know how long i can do this for before i kill myself or someone else, i dont know if theres a way to get out of this.

i feel like im faking this sometimes that maybe this is just me making excuses for how life is but i dont know if its normal to feel like this because its all ive ever felt.

thats kinda it for now, i know this was a lot im sorry if you got this far, i know theres a shit ton of mistakes i dont care i just wanted to get this off my chest."

I've made suggestions about therapy or seeing her family Dr to address whats going on. Its been two months and she hasn't done anything and seems worse. I know I cant force her to do anything, and she needs to do things at her own pace. Just not sure what I can do since she broke up with me to deal with herself and didn't want to burden me with the ups and downs. I love her and don't plan on going anywhere but she kinda forced me out of the picture. Any ideas to show support. I don't care if we get back together at this point just worried about her."

Everyone i met hates on me idk why but when they do something bad i just forgive and forget like it never happened before. I feel like i want to die if im always like this."
depression,It’s when I’m with other people that I realize how f*cked up I am,"Sometimes I wonder how life is for other people (« normal people »). For a while I thought that everyone had trauma that they dealt with, that everyone had been very depressed at least once in their lives etc.
But that’s not the case at all. 
The older I get, the more I realize that I really can’t relate to other people. 
The other day, a woman told me « you don’t know what it’s like to be alone in your house for two weeks » Because she had to quarantine. And that shocked me because this is literally what I spent my teenage years and even early twenties doing either studying or distracting myself. Lmao.
People regularly tell me that I’m « weird ». 
I never liked partying because it made me feel seen and unsafe and insecure about my body and the way I needed to act for people to have a good perception of me. 
It’s as if my normal was different from other people’s normal. Growing up, pleasures and fun were considered a luxury and when I hear someone complaining about things that I find unimportant it feels like we don’t live in the same reality almost. 
I always feel like I need to act a certain way around people so I used that overjoyed tone because if I use my normal tone I will seem emotionless and down. And I end up not acting like myself but it doesn’t sound natural at all and I hate it. 
I think that I have accepted that this is my brain and those are my life experiences and I can’t change that. And my first reaction always comes from a place of hurt/old trauma. But people are truly exhausting. I really don’t assume things about people and even if I do I don’t tell them that. Idk I’m tired, man."
depression,Why wont I die,"I've had depression for about 7 years of my life now.. it has been here for as far as I can remember. 
All the shit in my life always got to me so easily but its not even bloody surprising anymore. 
Nothing has ever worked out for me in my life and it doesnt even surprise me anymore that I dont deserve good things in my life. 
I've always been the quiet kid that no one notices, and if anyone does notice me, it just panics me and I quietly remove myself from the spotlight because it freaks me out. 
I have like 2 friends that dont care if I was there or not.
No one really talks to me or pays attention to me and I see why. I used to think its because I never speak, smile or try to be involved in anything but then I remember when I was all fine and normal, no one really cared back then either. 
Hell, I dont even feel bad for myself. I hate gathering sympathy for myself, please dont pity me, i see why people dont like or talk to an incompetent, worthless and incapable piece of shit like me.
I cant bring myself to study, work out, socialize or do anything productive. 
I dont have any talents or hobbies and interests, I just exist because I havent died yet.
Just why wont I die?
I wont kill myself because I don't want to hurt my parents, even though I'm sure it will be a huge burden off their chest either way."

depression,I've never felt more empty in my life,"School semester ended today and tomorrow my parents are going to know my grades. Ever since middle school I've been doing well getting consistent As and Bs on my report card. Depression hit hard this year and now my parents are going to see that I got a C in practically all of my classes. I know to some thats not horrible, and to me personally I think its just fine, but it won't slide for them. They'll be upset, and I'm very worried for how they'll react about it.

This ain't really my main point. Sam is a person I considered my best friend since we met in 4th grade, and due to his naivety, he's recently been in a toxic relationship with a manipulative girl who won't let him be friends with me. This girl I made upset in the past, and because of what I did Sam says he can no longer be friends with me. He ignores all my messages

And, I've never felt so empty.

At some point in my life, I've always had some person. Someone I cared for deeply as a friend who would give me a drive to keep going. Someone I could rely on to make me feel better. And believe me, I've had many new friends this year. But, it feels I don't really care about any of them. I feel so lonely despite being surrounded by lots of people to talk with. And its hard putting into words just how empty this has made me feel. Hell, some of my friend groups have been growing more toxic, I try to stop people from fighting, but it never works, hell, sometimes I make it worse

I think I'm just going to keep losing people I care about.

I want to talk to Sam again, I miss him.

I feel so horribly empty, and I don't have anyone to talk with, anyone I care for. I'm scared"

depression,"I’m so done with people claiming to be sensitive and attentive towards mental health conditions, but when it comes to dealing with them they straight up make it worse. How do I fight back?","TL;DR I struggle with depression and anxiety, which makes me slow (mentally and physically). My friend is great but makes me even more anxious with her apparently lack of actual comprehension of my behaviour. How can I deal with it?

That’s it. I’m done.
I love my friends but I’m so done.

“I’ve had anxiety and panic attacks too; I’ve dealt with depression as well you know”
Guess what, it manifests and works differently from all of us.

I love my friend/roommate, she’s supportive and always there for me, but when I can’t control how my mental health manifests she is always ready to snap and get on my throat. “Just grow up”

I’ve been dealing with said states since I was 12, and  until today I’ve been manifesting them by shutting down. I tend to forget stuff, chores, things I should do, and have a overall slower rhythm regarding housekeeping, groceries and general adult stuff. It takes longer for me because anxiety/shuts down get triggered by the most trivial stuff.

Said friend struggles as well with depression but it’s different, she reacts being overproductive or emotional apathy. I become a slime, she becomes a Ferrari (from my POV she gets hurt many times by it)

But I’m so done.
I can’t cook, I just don’t like it + I can’t properly perceive smells and flavours (no covid related) therefore I’m not good at it. She gets angry bc I don’t use my logic with it, bc I can’t listen to her properly and bc I’m not driven to improve it “If you want to keep eating savourless just do you” 

I forget house chores, but not to the point where the house becomes a dumpster. Like to wash dishes (worst case I was them the next morning), to put away dry laundry, throw away the trash bags (usually when they are on the balcony and I can’t see them) 

I have a bad case of “I’ll do it later” and “If I can’t see it, I forget about it”, but I’m trying to get better.

Plus I empathise so much, when she is feeling blue I absorb that, and generally after feeling blue she becomes a nazi and reprimends me for everything and gets at me. “I never leave the house messy for you when you are away, I’m so done dealing with you leaving traces”- which is not true, she does leave traces behind as well, but 1 I’m too tired to get back at her 2 I understand why she does and it’s not so bad to help her tide up

I’m so tired of it. I feel so introverted to talk back, I don’t know how come up with clapbacks. I’m usually anxious for “Have I forgotten something? Is there something on the chores list I left behind! I’m not doing enough! I definitely can’t rest, I must have missed something”

I noticed I can’t get to relax with her around unless it after dinner/dark or she’s relaxing as well.
How the fuck do I deal with this?"

depression,Going back to school made me go into a depressive episode,I have to start online school again tomorrow and I will also have to start school irl again it's making me spiral into a depressive episode and I cant escape it so I'm probably gonna spend the next few weeks barely paying attention to anything and being exhausted
depression,Dont want to live. Too scared to die.,"The last thing anyone wants is a sob story. I've always pushed myself through life, defined myself by my perseverance in the face of any obstacle.

That time, as of today, has passed. I'm tired. The weight of pushing forward has grown too heavy to move. I look at myself and see a broken man with hollow victories, nothing to show for it, nothing gained. Those I care for criticize me for ""over reacting"" when from where I stand I see it as caring too much. I used to want things. I wanted a happy marriage, to see my son grow and become something to be proud of.

I want nothing anymore. I burned hot, thinking my fire would never fade. But now all I have is ash and soot.

I have nothing left."
depression,"I've been depressed for a long time, how do I tell my mom","(Sorry for the name, was gonna post in r/teenagers, but was unaware they had a karma limit)

tldr: I'm depressed and am experiencing suicidal thoughts, due to stress from school. How do I effectively tell my mom this?

I've been depressed and have had suicidal thoughts for a while now. It all started when my girlfriend dumped me at a time when I was the happiest I had ever been. I felt that I could just take some time to recollect myself in the first few weeks of school since I probably wouldn't get a bunch of homework. That was a mistake. With all the homework I was getting I just got more stress and due to me still going to work at this time, I didn't have any time to myself. After a while my mom found out I was failing a good amount of my classes and now yells at me regularly to make sure that I get them up before the semester ends (which btw, is on the 14th). I've tried talking to her a couple times without making it as harsh, but every time I say that I should see a counselor she says that it would take too long to find one or that our insurance doesn't cover it. I just need to know how to talk to her effectively. Please help."
depression,"if it didn't exist, she would be fine?","I asked myself that question because, I have been thinking that to the girl I love, I could give everything for her, even tell her that the boy she likes says very nice things to me about her but I only tell her the things that really  I want to tell you.

I'm sick and tired of these comments that drive me into such sadness and frustration. 
I weigh around 165 pounds, yes I'm a bit overweight but not excessively so. And most importantly I'm able to accept myself as I am. I used to be super skinny in my teens and when I reached my twenties and starting working is when I put on weight. 
My family has been giving me hell over this for so many years. The worst thing is how the more they make comments and horrid statements, the more it makes the resist doing anything to lose weight.
I absolutely hate the way I'm being treated and honestly there's nothing I wish for more than to be far away from here and from all of them."
depression,Sneak peek into my life right now,"I love that my father refers to my depression as just being stressed. My parents are separated and I was going to spend a few weeks with my mom so he was going to tell her to remind me about calling my counselor. But no he didn’t say I’m in counseling for my depression, self harm, and eating disorder. He said I’m there because I’ve been stressed lately. But I was too scared to mention to my mom the real reason so well I’ve been there I’ve heard her talk about my step sister who self harms and she assumes its for attention, I’ve had my step dad joke about my “midnight snacks” that he hears we leave my room to get that he doesn’t know is me binge eating, and they have made jokes about how i don’t leave my bed or shower. I hate it here."
depression,Help,"Sorry for the wall of text. I don't know what to do. TLDR at bottom.

I asked this girl out to homecoming in September 2018. She rejected me, it stung, but my problems would get much worse. I started believing that everyone in the whole school thought I took a picture of her ass. I didn't. I told my mom about it (I'm a fucking pussy I know) and she just kinda justified my feelings, called other kids assholes, believing my interpretations were right. I realized like 3-4 weeks later that It wasn't true. Then, I started believing that I did this to my sister. That I took a picture of her ass. To be clear, i had a memory of me doing it. I was making timelines, asking friends what happened around certain dates, checking through old pictures and texts on my phone to see if I could connect that event to anything else to verify it. I kept it a secret. I was suicidal all the time. This lasted roughly 5-6 months. From November 2018 to April 2019. I convinced myself it was a false memory. I started getting scared though. One time in class my teacher mentioned the mandela effect, which is (kinda) related to false memories. One time, I was making one of my timelines in statistics and a kid asked what it was. My teacher standing right next to him responded a timeline. I remember crying at the time when they asked. (I guess I thought I confirmed it) I wondered if they noticed. I know I was overthinking now, but I started to believe that my teachers and parents and other kids knew. And they had plotted it to make me a stronger person. At the time, I'm pretty sure I believed my teachers and parents knew but not other kids. While this was going on, I started believing that I was highly gifted and the other kids who are actually in it were there just to help me. The two who weren't were there just to throw me off.

After the false memory incident, I started to believe that I was narcissistic and then autistic. I thought I was on the spectrum and that everyone around me was trying to nudge me into having better social skills. I barged into my sister's room and yelled ""I'm autistic aren't I?"" In the middle of summer 2019. She denied it and it caused a scene in our household.

I'm going to cut this short. My overthinking has since mostly ended. I nearly flunked out my senior year of high school. I went away to college. My grade are not terrible but they're not great. It's 2021 now. Ever since the new year started it doesn't even feel like I'm human. 2021 doesn't look like a year to me, just a series of digits. My life is still hellish. I have a group of friends from high school that I play video games with but it ain't that great. I don't really like them anymore. They're not bad people, we are all flawed, but they can be pretty immature and frankly I feel like we're all just losers together. I can't be a loser in 2021. They just keep justifying it. I can't keep justifying it to myself. My one friend blames all of his problems on others, if the enemy wins in a game it's because they were lucky. (Perhaps I'm overthinking) Every damn time. My other friend joined the navy and is a complete dick to his roommate. His roommate can be a bit of a dick too, but my friend set his alarm really early just to get back at him for something minor he did. I don't really like being around them, but I need to find more people to be around.

Sorry for my sob story. The only thing I know right now is that 2021 cannot be anything like 2020 or 2019. Things must change. I might edit this thread or direct message anyone who comments on this thread at the end of this year as like a thing to see how much I've changed. 

TLDR : I'm at rock bottom. I have almost no friends, I still don't have my driver's license. I'm directionless.

depression,Being patient...,"It's rough. I'm trying to find a therapist again. This time an online therapist because it is a lot cheaper for me through my insurance but I can only go through one place (teladoc) and the way it works is kind of ironically depressing for people with depressive disorders and anxiety! (In short, you just wait until a therapist you request agrees to have an appointment with you, it is just stressful)."

depression,I'm so tired of everything,"this is probably the first time i'm going to rant not with someone but through internet. In my school everybody knows me as a lively person, In our house they think I don't have problems cause I'm the youngest out of all our fam but no I'm completely opposite of all those. Since 1st grade I never had friends I rather call them my classmates. 3rd grade my dad left us without saying anything I cried the whole night without showing it to my family. Freshman I got bullied. I have an uncle from my mother side we only had 10 years gap he's the youngest obviously, I saw how my grandma took care of my uncle and I was so jealous cause my mom never done any of those things to me. Even until now my uncle is now working my grandma treats him like he's the youngest. To be honest I love getting attention more like an attention seeker. I had my hard times but no one was there to comfort me not even my Mom. I don't have a brother nor a sister to talk to, My friends I don't want to believe it but they backstabbed me in front of the whole batch. There was no day that I didn't cry. Ever since I realised that I feel lonely my entire life I became distant, I get mad easily, cry easily and sometimes I tend to be nervous without any reason and I'll end up vomiting. I'm tired of everything I feel like dying at the same time i don't want to so I try to cheer myself up to live the life what I wanted it to be. Not until one day me and my aunt got into a fight during it plenty of flashbacks run through my mind I ended up getting dizzy and locked myself in me and my mom's bedroom I was so done of everything I just wanted to live peacefully. When I woke up I saw my grandma and mom crying I felt pain on my left arm and I saw lots of blood. That's the first time I felt my Mom's warm hugged. Until now it doesn't  leave my thoughts if I haven't done it I wouldn't feel my mother's embrace. I just want to stop living without dying. I just can't live my life like this."
depression,I don’t know how I feel,"I recently just moved out of my toxic hometown a few months ago and I don’t know I’ve always wanted to leave but now that I have I kind of miss being home.. like my house was never much of a home but the feeling I get of walking into my empty house I just feel right, being here in my bed in my room, but at the same time I feel so alone here but I feel alone where I’m at also.. I hate this because my sister and friends all rant about how shitty of a place it is. It is. But I think it’s the only home feeling I’ve ever felt and it feels so weird not having it anymore... like an actual place to call home..."
depression,Slow and Steady Realizations,"Compiled some thoughts and have nowhere else to post this, I hope this would be okay. 

I was wondering, always looking for and maybe even grieving the lack of emotional support from my childhood. I look for it in the media I consume. I notice when characters have similar situations or are lucky enough to have been brought up with much love. I notice it in my friends and see how love flows in their life. Then there is me, I often think. Traversing through this emotional valley in the dark. I don't even know what to look for oftentimes. I look out and wonder, what if I had the sort of guidance other people had. What if someone believed in me just because I was born to them. I would keep searching in the world for sources of this kind of love.  Can you learn to love without being loved yourself? Then suddenly it came to me, these people who have provided that warmth and guidance are what I call...human. Perhaps, to some extent, we're all made the same way, with the same capacity to give that sort of compassion. Maybe I already had the tools within me for that same kind of love, for myself this time. Suddenly all the therapy, self-help books, essays, on self-love started making sense. It's a slow and steady journey of realizing I can learn to give that love to myself, that I can be an infinite fountain of kindness to myself. Maybe...maybe for the same reasons of just existing that someone deserves love...that's also enough of a reason to love myself."
depression,¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"Where to even start? 2019 ended and my life changed forever. My best friend in the entire world I had to put down. Something I never wanted to do. Since that day it’s like I died and became someone else. Life since has been like I’ve been watching from a distance. My dog is and was the only thing in this world that truly loved me no strings attached. Now, I am truly alone. 

My friends, well except maybe one or two stuck it out listening to me and my pain but If you’ve ever experienced utter depression you learn quickly, people don’t like being around sad people. 

Covid hit and anxiety is at an all time high. I have preexisting conditions and I fear to die like that... alone. I mean I am alone right now, sure I have my wife and new dog but I’m still not okay. 

My mom developed bipolar depression and she has lived with me for a few years now. This has been another difficult thing to watch the woman I saw so strong whither away. She’s become a different person, a person I don’t know. 

I just don’t see the fucking point anymore. I pray for death so I can be with my dog again where everything just made more sense. I am trying my best to stick close to my faith but I hate waking up each morning. I’m not suicidal I just wish to die. 

Therapy hasn’t worked. On my 8th shrink now and I think I’ll give up on that as a form of helping me. I’m pretty sure nothing will fix me anymore, I just kind of lost hope. 

At the end of the day we are all out for ourselves and it’s a Hokey belief that the relationships we have mean a damn. Eventually we all slip through the sands of time."
depression,I completely changed and I hate who I am now,"I used to be such a happy and funny guy a year ago. Even though I didn’t have many friends, people still found me enjoyable to have around as company. And now I’m just so boring and dull I hate it. I’ve lost all sense of happiness. I find nothing enjoyable anymore. The few friends I had are gone because I don’t even have the energy to communicate with them. I miss my old self."
depression,How much is too much to ask from those you consider your “support system”?,"This one might be a long one, so I’m sorry I’m advance!

So, After I graduated high school I took a year off to study abroad with a scholarship and learned a lot about myself. I became much more confident and sure about who I was, ready to start college hoping this time it’d be different than high school (basically 4 years alone being depressed without even knowing it). It wasn’t. I was back to the whole “study and work hard” mode and managed to ruin most friendships. However I realized it was because I was forcing it. Inviting myself to things. Being where I wasn’t really wanted. Giving and giving where no one would reciprocate. And I realized it was the same thing I did in high school. Basically noticed I wasn’t good at respecting myself and realizing my worth. The one thing that is different right now is that I have a boyfriend, and finally not a toxic one that just makes me hate myself more and blame myself for everything. But one who cares. He says I have helped him a lot and make him better. And I’m really glad to hear it because I love feeling helpful and needed (probably since I felt so useless in high school I crave that feeling). 

I’d say he’s my support system, and after talking to my psychiatrist and realizing the triggers that made me start taking medicine again werent really there anymore, I could slowly stop taking it. I thought with my boyfriend I had a solid support system, so I really thought I’d be okay without taking any medicine, also considering I have a better mentality overall after receiving therapy and counseling too. However, he is a very busy person and we also think he might have anxiety or ADHD. He’s also used to dealing with his bad days completely on his own. So often times I feel like I’m a terrible girlfriend because he doesn’t need me at his worst, and when I try to cheer him up I somehow manage to make things worse. Also, when I have my depressive episodes and I need someone’s
Full attention to just listen to me and stop me from thinking so many negative things, he’s not really there. He replies every 20-30 minutes, replies to one or two of my texts and doesn’t really say anything helpful and goes offline again. He says he does his best to cheer me up and be there for me but him not being able to just stop what he’s doing and just give me his full attention for a little makes me think he’s just doing something more important and my depressive episode doesn’t matter that much to him. Like I said before, I had never had a support system (or a bf who wasn’t toxic and manipulative) and I don’t know what to expect or how much is too much to ask for... is it selfish for me to ask him to give me his full attention when I’m depressed during some random night? I know that if it were the other way around I would drop whatever I’m doing and call him or do whatever is needed for him to feel better and avoid any bad decisions from being made, so is it wrong for me to expect the same thing back? I am legitimately asking. I do tend to have high standards and expectations on people whicb is why I end up disappointing myself. I also don’t want to put a lot of pressure on him because he’s my boyfriend, not my psychiatrist and I don’t want to lose him just because I’m too much. What Is a healthy expectation to have for my boyfriend when dealing with my depression?"
depression,Depression in a relationship,I have dealt with depression &amp; anxiety for many years it started as a child. Now as an adult it is starting to affect my relationship and I really do not like that it affects my relationship in a way where I act nothing like I am. I get upset very easily and take my sadness or anger out on my partner. How can I put an end to these episodes or are there any exercises that can help ? I really love my boyfriend but have a difficult time dealing with my depression. I don’t want this to build up and cause issues in our future.

depression,Can't sleep because I convinced myself that my best friend is dead,"He's suicidal and he's changed his activity status on Instagram to not be visible. He's also turned off his Snapchat location. I can't tell when's the last time he was online.

I've been checking traffic cameras near places where I know he's attempted before. I'm looking to see if his vehicle is parked there. I've been going through every single traffic incident report from the past 12 hours, trying to figure out if it's him. I'm checking if there's been any incidents on railways.

I've gone through social media account I can find to see a hint of activity.

He usually responds to me. Even if we're having an argument, he'll respond to me asking if he's alive.

But he hasn't.

I tried calling his phone and I hung up after one beep because I was crying and just uhhh not good, and I feel like I'm overreacting. He might just be needing some space. He might be asleep.

But the phone call went through. So his phone is intact.

He might still have overdosed instead of jumping off a bridge though.

I'm. So fucking stressed."

I got outta a mental hospital on Nov 24th (I tried to kill myself but as can tell it didn't work(and my case worker got me to take me to my foster home, well driving back my case worker tells me my mom wants to take my phone (I've had more DSS cases in the past and my mom took my diary and phone bc it held comfort for me) I talked to my mom a few weeks after and her and my dad ruined my mental state, my dad told me my grandparents might die bc of the DSS case and that i cant have no friends bc a friend assaulted me, my mom trying to hold me and ""comfort"" me ig u can say. If I plan to go back home I wanna live with my grandparents away from my dad and my goal was to go home soon maybe late January or early February. I can't stand living in this foster home without a way to feel sum thing, my foster mom told me i was going to hell for being bi, my sister is toxic and likes to talk abt my assaults to blackmail me, I get blackmailed from her a lot and idk what to do abt it.

depression,depression attacks,"do y’all get “depression attacks?” idk what to call them but like the opposite of a panic attack where basically you shut down and stop thinking? is this is normal thing or what bc i get these all the time and don’t know what to do with them or how to even explain it if someone knows what i mean? it’s like i don’t want to exist anymore, and i just go into hibernation mode. again this might not make sense please someone tell me you understand and what is happening because i don’t."

I try so hard to be grateful for my life and happy, but I just am not. I hate that I’m not. I feel maybe I don’t even deserve happiness because I struggle to find it. Really, the only thing I have are these anonymous Reddit posts. I still think about dying a lot, but I’m too scared. I have a cat, and I can’t abandon my baby, and I can’t let down my mom, family, and friends. But I wish I could. I don’t think I’m capable or ready for life. I’m a 22 recent graduate, but I just feel like a failure. I fear the rest of my life is me just living in that failure, so I might as we end it now. Perhaps that’s cowardly, but I don’t want to live just to prove I’m brave and strong if that’s not what I am. I wish I could let myself die but there’s always some awful voice in my head giving me hope that somehow, somethings could change and be different."

depression,my depression and socializing.,"i have been through alot. like my whole life, but specifically the last... 3 or so years. and i may have not have had it as bad as other people and i know that, but to me everything that has happened has been huge. but anyways, i live with my mom and my boyfriend in my moms house. she supports all three of us for various reasons. she doesnt really have a social life, and neither do we. the only time i leave the house is to go grocery shopping, go get cigarettes, take my mom somewhere, or my bf and i go to his brothers house. hes got his own set of problems, but he also has a sweet gaming garage. we are all pretty much intoxicated one way or another when we hang out with him, so we always just end up goofing around and having fun. i am now completely comfortable around him (it takes a while lmao). but anyways again (sorry im a stoner) ive recently been getting back on fb after avoiding people that remind me of the bad things that have happened (even though they are great people), and one of them messaged me for christmas and ive been slowly messaging him back because i knew it was going to turn into a conversation. now he wants me to hang out with him, and meet his wife and kid. which i would normally, love to do! but i just....cant. this guy is awesome, and his wife is an adorable canadian and i love canada lol. and their kid is so adorable. but like... where would we hang out? theres no room in my house, plus we all smoke, so no kids in here. cant go out in public because of the virus. and in case i start crying for some reason. so i (maybe also my bf i dont even know if he would want to), would have to go to his house, by myself most likely to meet this dudes wife and kid, and i HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. i dont work. i literally sit at home and watch tv, play on my phone, tablet all day. hes going to want to know whats been going on. well i dont really want to rain on his parade like that man. because it has not been going well since we last talked (for me). and hes a really caring person and i dont want to put that on him. i mean honestly its a lot more complicated than even this. but i am not typing all of what happened. i just dont even know how to ""have friends"" anymore. and jesus this is just ONE of the people ive been avoiding. the sweetest one. just getting a message from him gives me anxiety, because i dont know what hes going to bring up. 

TL;DR my depression has turned me into such a hermit, that i dont even know how to talk to people/ how to act around people anymore. and that gives me so much more anxiety onto of my anxiety sundae.

sorry this turned into a ramble.... i just got off fb messenger and needed to vent lol"
depression,I can’t move on from the mental hospital what do I do?,"For a while I was in a mental hospital because of self harm, suicidal tendencies, anxiety and depression. In public school I was desperate for friends but I was alone for years I struggled to make friends. In that short time I made more close friends in the hospital than I ever did in the “normal world” I had an entire friend group, and they where the fucking best we got so so so close in such a small amount of time. I’d never felt the support, comfort and acceptance I felt with those people. Although we weren’t allowed to we shared personal info. Once I got discharged some of the other people did to and we texted for a short while. I talk to none of them now we distanced since we had to get back on track with our life’s. I can’t move on from that. The reason for going to the hospital was like my darkest point but when I was actually there I think it might have been the happiest I’d ever been, I don’t know how to move on from that. I miss how we talked when we where all there but now they’re very cold and distant and I understand that because they are trying to continue they’re regular life but I just can’t let go of the experience and how I’ll never feel that kind of support again, what am I supposed to do now to move on? After getting discharged I was supposed to get a therapist but covid hasn’t allowed that so I went from 24/7 support to complete loneliness and the meds don’t do anything anymore can I get some help or guidance on what to do?"
depression,why is everything wrong,my life is wrong all of my friends are wrong i live wrong im wrong i can’t fix it or make it wrong no it’s all my wrong even my arm is wrong and my fingers and my bed and my walls to the ceiling to the floor to the ground it’s wrong wrong
depression,just want to be ok.,been dealing with depression since 13. it’s been pretty bad. not really eating. poor sleep. overthinking. i just want to be ok. i’ve been thinking about myself a lot but as a child. how i wish i can just hug the younger me. how bugging me could have prevented so much pain. how having someone could have just saved me. but i can’t. i constantly face younger me and as of late she’s all i see. i don’t know what to do.

depression,My dad yelled at me about tennis.. im done,"My dad walked into my room and asked to talk, he started saying how he wants me to be more physically active (which i can understand to a degree) and he asks me if i would be interested in doing tennis lessons and i replied saying no thank you but i would be more interested in doing something that involves not going outside the house because 1. I am not interested in playing tennis and 2. Were in a global fucking pandemic and i dont want to get potentially infected/possibly infect another human who can potentially infect another just to play fucking tennis when i can just exercise at home without risking the health of another person, as soon as i say what i thought my father instantly gets all pissed off and proceeds to tell me “oh i should shut the internet off too then huh? Gotta isolate” and that hes willing to get peoples opinions on this shit and that “dont be afraid to live your life” ah yes dad because caring about other peoples health not wanting to spread COVID-19 and be a responsible and good citizen is being “scared” and im “lazy” for laying in bed all day (i dont actually lay in bed all day though what the fuck) 

Anyways, thank you to whoever read this rant of mine, just feeling really depressed right now over all this and stressed , and also just a reminder you are all loved and you matter and hope you all have a good day/night and happy 2021 :)"
depression,Just came to the harsh reality that I’m going to outlive all of my relatives,"Just started thinking about it in the shower just now and it just made me really depressed.

Sorry for the small vent, it just sucks that one day we’ll outlive the people that we care about."
depression,I Can’t figure out what to do anymore...,"I have been skipping school for a long time now and I am really far behind in math, on top of that the lockdown has made me feel weird in a way that I have never felt before almost ‘depressed’ I don’t even know what I want to do when I’m older and the only interests I have are language learning and trying but failing at game development.

I always never took school seriously and got A’s until it got harder and I had to try in Math and then I started to fail, I was so shortsighted back then and I didn’t think of the bigger picture. I should’ve put the effort in to study. Like how the fuck do you catch up on math when you’re as behind as me. Fucking hell..."

depression,Hi,[removed]
depression,I am a worthless piece of stupid fat trash and I have wasted another year,"I left college 4 years ago and I've yet to do anything. The last 10 years have gone to complete waste. It is 2021 and I am 26 this year. I am a failure. It is 3:30am and I cannot sleep because the disappointment and shame of my life is crushing. I have accomplished nothing nor have I taken any steps forward.

I am tired of hearing that ""I am young"". I am not young, I am too old to be doing this poorly. I haven't got a single friend or good relationship in my life. I hate my family and my parents have done a poor job. I am working minimum wage, I struggle immensely to find employment because of the competition. I have no social life, potential, or innate worth. I have not done anything worthwhile. I have spent the last 6 years exactly where I am now. I failed to move out from my mother's house. I failed to find a career path. I failed in therapy and I failed college.

My classmates prepared better than I did during college and set themselves up for employment. I was too depressed from my family-forced choice of college major. I did not have the insight, courage, or maturity to change courses. I ended up with a useless degree and a strong sense of failure after failing to procure acceptable grades.

I am in a low-level community college course now, trying to find a small internship. I don't expect much out of it. The time to make something of myself has gone. I have always been a loser and I have always been picked last and picked on. I have no money or source of stable income. I have no positive life experience. I have an empty resume with large gaps. I have poor health. I lack a support system. I have a useless education. I have low intellect and zero common sense. I have no travel experience or independence. If I have not made progress by now, I never will.

I come from a family of dimwits who follow a backwards and archaic religion. I hate my heritage, my appearance, and my last name. I feel tainted for life for being related to them. I struggle to manage my dislike for them and my anger for the things they have said to me.

I am an extremely angry person. I have humiliated, ashamed, and furious for the poor choices I made in the last 15 years. I have made the worst choices possible and publicly humiliated myself for no reason. I deeply regret publicly dating a whore, I deeply regret neglecting my education, I deeply regret letting myself be walked all over. I hate people and I hate the world and I hate myself.

There is not one good thing in my joke of a life. I am a joke of a man. I am a pathetic, stupid, low worth/intellect, fat, ugly, mediocre, asinine, inexperienced, implacable piece of shit. I have failed in everything I have engaged in. I am the lowest of the low and a failure of the lowest order. I have performance anxiety, uncontrollable anger, heavy depression, and an ugly demeanor.

I missed out on a normal adolescence. I missed out on 'firsts', I missed out on prom, I missed out on college experiences, I missed out on being young. Instead I have haunting memories of abuse, bullying, humiliation, failure, loneliness, insecurity and countless putdowns. It is too late to make friends now, I am too old and I missed the boat. There comes an age where the glass cools and hardens, and we are no longer malleable enough to shape. I don't care what platitudes anyone throws at me, they simply aren't true. I will never be able to change.

This is who I am and this is who I always will be. I am fed up with raising my expectations only to be brought back to the hellish reality of the worthless piece of fat trash I am. A miserable excuse for a man who made a mess of his life for no good reason and has nothing to show for it. I deserve to be dead, I should have never been born at all. The best thing that could happen to me is a sudden heart attack to put me out of my misery. I am not cut out for this life and I never asked for it.

I am no better today than I was 365 days ago. I have accomplished nothing of value. I am a life loser and I always will be."
depression,I don't seem to care about people,"Hi, I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post but here goes nothing.
I(29M) have realized that I don't care about people, even though I sometimes feel lonely and try to contact someone I just don't care about them, even worse I don't care about anyone in my family, I have good relations with my parents and my sister and I'm grateful for what they've done for me but I just don't care about their lives, I try to help them with money if they ever need it(it's rare they are very responsible people) but when they talk to me about things or ask mento go visit them I just don't care and sometimes even think is annoying, never had a girlfriend or any kind of close friend, now I don't know why, but I am becoming so scared of being alone but still don't want contact with anyone, the fear is getting stronger every day and I don't know what to do.

Thank you for reading, have a nice day."

depression,It’s getting more difficult everyday.,"The thought of having to wake up to go to work pains me. Looking around my house and knowing I have to clean/upkeep it overwhelms me. Feeding myself seems like a chore as most of the time I don’t feel hungry at all, even though my body would tell me otherwise. My sleep schedule has gravitated more towards staying up until all hours of the night and then passing out during the day. 

I don’t really get joy from doing much of anything anymore other than sleeping, probably because I don’t have to think to do that.

Tried reaching out to a family member to talk/vent or whatever and was told I have a “chip on my shoulder” and to “get over it.” Cool, really helpful, I appreciate that.

I feel like I’m at my breaking point tbh, don’t know how much longer I can keep up with the illusion of “Everything is fine.” while I’m at work or in public."
depression,"my real feelings, since no one i know cares to listen.","I've liked this girl for quite a long time now and I finally got to ""date"" her (she want a ""toned down"" dating relationship), but of course there's no way anyone can actually like me. especially someone like her. she's way out of my league.. she acts like she likes me but there's obvious signs she doesn't. that or my overthinking is taking control of me. I dont have a real chance with her in a million lifetimes.... anyway I realized that I'm not as important to anyone as they are to me. everyone in my life means so much to me. whenever they're down I do my best to help them up, but no one asks about me or tries to get me to tell them how I feel. no one really seems to care about my mental state. i have so many feelings i want to let out but i feel like I would just be a nuisance to everyone, if they'd care to listen in the first place. only one of my acquaintances (not a close friend) asked me if im ok. no one else. im thankful for him because then I wouldn't have written this and gotten my thoughts sorted out. since no one asks how I am, I just resort to putting song lyrics that sound how I feel on my instagram stories. I feel like im always alone despite technically having a (sort of) girlfriend now. I just want someone to care about me and love me as much as I love them, but it would seem that that is impossible. I've lost my reason to live and I dont even know what I wake up for anymore. whenever I try my hardest for something i want, it always blows up in my face and I just end up worse than before. I have no impact on anyone's life, and If I do its likely a more negative one. Or maybe it was positive, until they forgot about it. I'm useless and my life is pointless. I'm like a parasite. Or maybe an empty husk that thirsts for love. I hate my mind so much. it always makes the wrong decision or makes me anxious or makes me overthink. I'm just a fool. I'm a loser that spends all their time alone. I waste away my life online or laying on the ground listening to spotify. I feel worse and worse by the day. The only thing that makes me feel remotely [temporarily] better is energy drinks.. I wanna overdose on something or put a bullet in my head so bad. I feel like death would feel so much better than this. I'm too much of a pussy to actually do that, though. scary thing is, I've been getting less scared of death. I feel like if I disappeared no one would notice anyway. I've finally found out my identity though, I'm just a useless, forgotten, foolish, cowardly loser."
depression,Needed somewhere to rant,"I feel like such a piece of shit. I know I'm not, that I'm actually trying hard, but I keep failing, and I'm trying so hard to be optimistic. 

I know I finally have meds that work a bit, but I still can't figure out how to care about myself? My family and friends like me, and I trust them so I know I'm NOT human garbage, but I just can't internalize that.

I loathe myself, so much. I want to die ALL THE TIME. I don't understand what the point of living is. I'm supposed to treasure each individual day, because fuck it I'm here anyway right? But I can't internalize that.

It feels like something inside me is constantly demanding a justification for my existence. Like if I'm not doing something for someone else at any point in time, then I'm inherently worthless, how dare I take up this space, I'm a selfish person. 

And there is this sense of if I have no utility, or worth to others, then I just shouldn't exist. It's a broken logic, but if if I'm not actively serving other things or people, what's the point of existing, I'm gonna die anyway, so any of my feelings or actions I make for me, ultimately don't matter.

And it's even more twisted because if I did care more about myself I could probably do way more for the people around me. 

I think I'm overthinking and I probably just need sleep, but SLeEp iS SeLfcARe So WHo KNowS WhEN tHat WilL hAPpeN ( and I'd have to lie in bed and think quietly about my existence and realize that I forgot to shower and I can't now because it's 3am and I don't want to wake up my brother, but FUCK my face feels greasy)

Maybe just say fuck it, fuck you life I'm here for whatever bullshit you wanna pull, and I'll probably hate myself anyway, but I also want to get decent sleep occasionally.

Maybe I need to just shut down all nihilist thoughts maybe that shit is an inherently unhealthy viewpoint. Who knows.

I don't know how to stop. Good night."

I want a partner so bad it hurts. I just don’t want to live anymore. I attempted hanging myself in the past and I very much wish it was a success.

depression,My boyfriend is withdrawing from me - how can I help him?,"I'm really sorry if this is the wrong sub for this post - I couldn't find anything against it in the rules.

My boyfriend (M21) has depression. He is currently medicated and sees a psychologist. Currently we’re living in different states, and due to potential border closures I’m unsure when we’ll next see each other.

Recently, he’s been struggling due to life events and stress. He struggles to process his emotions, and tends to withdraw socially when going through big things. As a result, we’ve started losing contact: we used to talk every day, but now he rarely replies to my messages.

I’m not trying to blame him at all – I understand that depression can drain people’s energy and make them withdraw from loved ones. I guess what I’m looking for is advice. I really miss him, and I want to help make this hard time easier. Should I reach out some more, or give him space?"
depression,I’m so tired,"I post all of these motivational things and say ‘keep going!’ ‘It gets better!’ ‘There is a light at the end!’ But I’m so tired. I just want to be held, and loved and told it’s okay. I want to be okay. 

I’m so tired of fighting to survive when there’s no reason to survive. I don’t know why living is a reason anymore. There is no motivation except my family wants me alive so I live for them. But when every day is literally just a battle then why keep going on?

Imagine being normal. Not having moments where you burst into tears because of overwhelming feelings of loneliness and depression. Waking up and feeling okay. Having moments of happiness and thinking ‘this is what I could feel like but I know it’s fleeting so I have to hold onto it greatly.’

Instead I wake up and think ‘oh great. Another day to try and survive. Wonder how many times I’ll break down today.’

I’m just exhausted. I don’t want to fight anymore, I don’t want to survive anymore. I want to actually live, be normal, be happy."
depression,I dont want to live. Not anymore.,"I used to have a group of best friends they were awesome, happy parents, A good and fun life.

My parents are depressed, My mother wants to die because of (personal stuff that i dont want to talk about) She smiles around people and pretends to be ok but has an absolute shit life with nothing other than her kids to keep her going. My father is in beyond stress and this was before the pandemic, Work is becoming way too hard on him, the company is dying and we have drowned in debt and only going deeper. His whole body aching but still has to keep going to not go homeless. And me with nothing to live for other than my parents. I have nobody, I dont want a future, I dont want to exist. Nothing will change. I want to suicide and would have if i weren’t afraid of the pain but im only getting worse, one day i will take any death just as long as i die and that day is not far. I dont have a purpose and believe that i already am in hell. Life is not a miracle... Its a curse. The only reason im talking about this is the fact that im willing to find another way if there is one, If things can somehow get better."
depression,Idk man,Look my dad used to abuse me physically and mentally my mom never did anything about it and she’s annoying (sorry mom) I’m being totally up front here not gonna spare anybody’s feelings. My dad only thinks about himself has a toxic personality and can’t be wrong. I have depression anxiety all the works I skip a lot of school due to everything my friends just aren’t really there I’m not close with anybody I basically don’t have friends they invite me sometimes not much tho. I’m afraid of working a normal 9 to 5 job I don’t want that I don’t want to have a normal life I’ve kind of gotten used to sadness and am now addicted to it Bc of Seratonin or maybe it just a let’s me have emotions for a little bit and right now I’m just sad depressed school starts tomorrow and I just can’t go back. Also I believe I have a good personality Bc everybody I’m not nervous around really likes me which is basically just my family and one friend I believe this is Bc they have seen my demons and are still there they’ve seen the worst of me and are still there so I feel ok with my mistakes even if I despise my family  even if not really. And I just kind of despise parts of myself I just kinda want to die until I had a dream where I died and it was horrible now I don’t want to die I just want to be happy. At least I have Minecraft I geuss planning on getting a pc once I’ve saved up. Play my life away. Nobody realizes screens are the only thing there for me they aren’t causing anything bad I’m physically healthy just short and a minority. Idk what posting is going to do nothing helps I’ve tried suicide prevention it was just bots. I recently told my father how much he hurt me and he’s just said sorry I had it worse basically I had it worse you should be grateful also your friends probably have it worse shut up and don’t tell anyone. I told my mom once and she just denied me while I was screaming and crying telling her my dad beat me and she just said no he didn’t no he didn’t. What the fuck is wrong with you mom fuck all of you. Not you guys but you now what I mean. There’s more but idk if I want to say. Also when it gets late at night I get sleep drunk and just say whatever so yippeeeeeeeee. Please somebody if anybody can help please
depression,Seeing others succeed makes me feel worse about myself,"My parents tell me i don't have to feel that way, and that i should just live a normal life, it doesn't have to be anything special. I feel bad for them. They didn't get what they paid for. They endured much suffering just to get the least. I've got brothers who ended up as drug addicts and i feel like i'll end up like them.

I discussed things with my dad, and at some point we came to talking about depression and its only cure is strong willpower. He had depression before and used it to his advantage by being suicidal enough to walk into a war as a medic, while i on the other hand am just depressed to do absolutely nothing with my life. I don't know if it really was willpower or inspiration that drove him. No matter the thoughts, fantasies, anything, i can't seem to push myself out. 

What is depression, really? I can feel happy, feel good, but most of the time i'm numb and don't see myself as valuable. I'd sometimes daydream about a fantasy of myself being an actual important or productive person instead of a parasite. It seems that i can't do anything. I'm also denying antidepressants since they'll worsen your condition, and also since my mom is afraid i'll end up like my drug addicted half-brothers, i can't and won't take medical cannabis. It feels like to me most powerful drug for this condition is a .40 S&amp;W bullet to the head.

I feel like higher success than my parents is an obligation because i'm their successor, therefore i must be able to do better, but something inside just wants me to stay grounded. Is this God's plan? Or is it just my broken brain?"

depression,I messed up and could use some advice,"I was involved in a conspiracy to rob some kid. The police asked me for the girls name that gave the address and stupidly I gave it to them despite the fact I said she had no involvement. My idea was if they went to her they would clarify what I said meaning she didn’t know shit about it. Little did I know my friend spilled the beans on her involvement and now not only do they know who she is they know how she’s involved. I messed up saying her name cause I was thinking about a way to save both of us thru her. I wasn’t thinking straight and now she might get involved. I have been having nervous breakdowns.
I’ve dealt with depression for my whole life. I’ve pondered committing suicide and have attempted it but now it seems like I really want to again. It would be better if this all went away. I feel like shit and I let my best friend down. In the end I realized how dumb it was even if he messed up too. I have dealt with a lot of stress and have had mental breakdowns over it. The depression is mixing with the fact that I won’t have a friend no more and the label of “rat” keeps popping in my mind. I hope to get some advice on what to do. I feel worried although I said she had no involvement and that I found the address and even re told them the address and how I found it."

depression,2021 will be my final year,"The pain and loneliness I have felt over the past 3 years have taken their toll on all that I am. Too many days and nights, I have either fallen deeper into the abyss of my depression listening to those voices reminding me of what little worth in society I have. Or just imagining how my afterlife will be nothing more than sitting in a dark room with an old timely projector running my greatest regrets again and again until the bulb over heats and blows leaving me in the dark with only my memories for the rest of time.

I’ve lost too many close family members, I’ve relocated back to a place I never wanted to return to; all because of this virus and the lack of work. Financial I’m struggling for the same reasons and I’m now working in factories for far less than what I was pre-COVID. All of this has all added up to just making me feel worthless, and a failure.

I’ve decided that 2021 will be my final year. I can’t continue with these thoughts and feelings. I need to do this on my own terms and conditions. 

So it’s time for me get the hell out of this rut! Find friends, start to exercise and get the hell out of this cell I call an apartment, and focus on changing who I am, into who I deserve to be!  I’m going to start every side hustle I can, I’m going to put myself into situations that I feel uncomfortable, and I’m going to own the room!

I’m going to do the opposite to what that weak and pathetic voice tells me, because I AM freaking worthy damn it! I’m worthy to be loved!, to be successful!, to be that person ‘5 year old me’ knew I would become... except without the being a Space Cowboy with the pet dragon thing... for now.

I’m going to change my diet to be healthy and consistent. I’m going to exercise and get the body I want for myself, and I’m going to make sure I get the right about of sleep, at the right times; no more 3am sleeping just to wake two hours later to get ready for work.

And I’m going to be proud of who I am!

I’m not doing this for anyone but me! This year, I’m making the “one” in 2021 all about me!

2021 will be the final year of my depression! I’m claiming all the shit I’ve lost back, with interest!

Here’s to twenty twenty won!"

When my dad got released from jail after 5 years i was still going from institute to institute. Later a friend of my mom told me she always wanted to kill me because i was supposedly the cause of all her problems. Then childservices. Told me i had to live with my dad. He sexually abused me till i was 21. When i had enough i scared him away. Now he is missing for 7 years. I had s*xual issues due to the abuse. I got a home for myself. And started being a prostitute. But then i met my neighbor. We started dating real quick. It felt so amazing to have someone understand you and .ake you geel vulnerable and safe. But she turned abusive. Manipulative and started cheating and lying about it. Telling ne i should have more trust in people.. when i finnali broke uo with her. She started spreading rumours about me. Like i was fysicly abusing her. Even go so far as calling the police on me for wanting some time apart. Now she is stalking me. And i have found a girl who i rly like.

depression,"26, no job, no motivation","So a few days ago I just completed my flight training and got my commercial pilot’s license. Something I should be happy about but considering the current circumstances I might not be able to fulfill my purpose of being an airline pilot for at least two years (the estimate I was given by the airline I’m under). I say purpose because well, being a pilot wasn’t exactly my dream but it was a job I thought would be comfortable and offer me good financial stability (my dad and brother are pilots too). Now I sit here, locked in my room for two days straight, feeling as unmotivated and unfit as ever having no idea what the future holds for me. I constantly have this feeling that being rich would solve all my problems. For me being happy is being able to afford almost anything I want and not having to worry about money. But I’m 26, unemployed, and have no motivation to do anything at all. I have a lot of people who love me, but somehow still feel so alone as everyone else seem to have their lives pretty much sorted. Feeling this way has also made me more fragile. The littlest of things now make me sad and well, I just don’t know what to do anymore. I guess I’m writing this just to let things out so to speak. I hope everyone else is having a less shitty day than I am."
depression,Quitting 45mg mirtazapine cold turkey,"Hey, I’m not usually the type of person to talk about any of my personal stuff online, but I feel like this is the best place for it. 

I’ve been taking mirtazapine 45mg for like nearly a year now, was on 15-30mg for 3-4 months and started originally taking mirtazapine about September time 2019 and been on it since. 

I want to quit cold turkey starting today. I don’t feel myself anymore, I feel apathetic and can’t seem to cry properly anymore compared to what I use to be like. I’m not numb to most emotions, but they feel more dull. It scares me and I feel like I’m borderlining sociopathy at times.

I’m wondering if this will be a severely bad idea and looking for any help and information, would be greatly appreciated. I just want to feel my old self again, even if that means crying on a daily basis, at least I will feel human."
depression,Sometimes I am completely FINE. Some days I’m broken to the core.,"It’s such a strange place I live at in my head. My friends would describe me as overall very happy, I’m always smiling, I’m always the light. All of those things are very much true, but some days.. a lot of days... I cry.. I cry so hard and so much that I wonder how is this even possible. I sit on my couch (I love sleeping on the couch) for days. Sleeping, barely eating, watching tv, letting these days pass by. It’s absolutely crazy. Don’t get me started on relationships, I get overly attached so quickly and end up heartbroken in a week and spend months trying to get over someone who meant nothing from the beginning. My life is strange. My mind is strange. Sometimes theirs this voice in my head wanting to just let it all go, free myself from the pain of this life. I’m simply just fighting myself. Fighting my past. Silly me, I thought 2021 would magically erase all my problems but three days in and I feel everything. Everything I didn’t feel in 2020. 

Finally, today, this fog is lifting. I can sit up instead of laying down all day. I can take my dog outside. I can get up and eat a whole meal. I can text my friends back. I can answer phone calls. I’m not 100% there but, hey I’m coming back."
depression,I feel nothing when I think about myself dying,"It just... Doesn't seem scary anymore. If anything life on Earth is what's fucking scary. The only thing keeping me from doing it is knowing my family would be horribly traumatized and depressed if I ever did... I care more about my loved ones dying or how they would feel after I die. The thought of me dying doesn't scare me. I feel like there's somewhere better for me out there. Life here is too hard. I'm too sensitive and feel everything too deeply.
Politics, disease, war, genocide, homophobia, racism, ableism, classism, sex trafficking, rape, murder, torture, the list does on. Everything is fake. Money, jobs, the economy, governments, social status, technology.... Literally all of it is fake. We are just energy being transported around by this vehicle we call a body. Our brain and senses try to make sense of this world around us. Life is a game that's been around for ages, with no end in sight. I don't want to play the game anymore. I don't want to be in this stupid flesh suit on this stupid planet I genuinely believe I'm so much more this. I sleep all the time because the world that exists in my dreams is so much better than this one. I know there's so much more out there.. so why do I stay here, in this waiting room between birth and death."
depression,I’m giving myself five years.,"I decided on New Year’s Day that I’m giving myself 5 more years. In those five years I’m making the commitment to do everything in my might to get better. That means opening up to things I couldn’t accept before such as taking proper physical care of myself and my house, therapy, accepting help etc. The things that have proven to help in situations like this: for the next five years I’ll do them all. 

The reason is that I actually really want to live and feel happy. I have been working so hard towards that for years now but am still depressed. People point out all the time that I have come so far and I have, but inside I still don’t feel that foundation of being okay that i would like to feel. I know how it feels, I’ve been there for brief periods, and I’d like to be at that point consistently. 

However if in 5 years, I’ve done everything in my power and I still don’t feel that way, I am giving myself permission to go and see myself out of this world. I am going to be very transparent about this to my friends and family, and if I go I mean to go well, having paid off my debts and taken care of my physical belongings, and making sure that everyone understands and hopefully has peace with how I feel and why I had to do it. 

Don’t worry, I’m not suicidal, I never have been. But I owe it to myself to stop my suffering. I will take on this task of showing up to myself every day for the next five years.

Today, my goal is to research methods on how to gently but steadily heal my depression’s ass. That sounded nicer than beating it. I’m going to try and get this done."
depression,Parents act like they never FUCKING relate to how we are feeling???,"Have our parents never felt extremely sad when they were our age?

I am literally being told to be wilfully ignorant (to be happy) and that seems quite telling, doesn't it?

depression,I need to vent but I have no one,"I haven’t been diagnosed, and I don’t want to be insensitive and self diagnose myself with any sort of mental health issue or anything, but I feel I can’t deny it anymore. The first time I noticed I felt like this, I thought it might be for a couple of days or maybe a week or two, I’ve been feeling like this for about two years almost. Everyday is a hellhole I’ve been trying to climb out of, but before it was much easier. Before the pandemic I hanged around with friends in school, and alcohol was a pretty good coping mechanism. Even if every time I got drunk my friends would tell me I was crying about something, I didn’t care, I think it helped me get through. Then about a month before the pandemic, I came home drunk, I threw up on a friends car and my yelled at my parents apparently, I don’t recall much of this incident as I blacked out. After that my parents never let me go out to parties from then, and with the pandemic later on, I’ve been stuck with my family for about 10 months like most people, but here has become worse than ever. Don’t get me wrong, I love my family, I appreciate everything they do, but we don’t share the same beliefs, and whenever I talk to any of them their answer is “to tell god and put it all on him” and I even tried to do it but it didn’t help. The first semester online, with the pandemic, I felt pretty much the same, but towards the end of the semester things started to change a lot. I flunked math, which to be fair I’m not a genius or anything but, I had always managed to get through, and my grades pre-covid were pretty good (80%), the next semester, this last one, I flunked 6 subjects. I am ashamed of myself for letting this happen to me but I just couldn’t focus, I was either distracted by video games because that was how I was interacting with my friends or I was just distracted with something else, I procrastinated literally every single assignment of all subjects. Because of this the school arranged a meeting with a psychologist or psychiatrist i don’t really know his specialty, but the only 3 times I met with him he told me repeatedly “you might have depression” or “you are depressed”. Last time I met him I gave in and started to vent even harder than this 80 page essay. As a man I felt very uncomfortable just crying, but once I started I just couldn’t stop the tears, and then it was holidays. My grandma came home for the holidays because her house is being renovated as my grandpa just passed away and she had been having health issues and my mom is a retired nurse. So this weeks I’ve tried to keep a much happier mood at least around her, because I can’t let myself see me like this, in pain. As both my parents worked, she and grandpa were pretty much the ones who we grew up with. But I can’t keep denying it, I need to vent, and even though I mentioned friends I don’t think anyone is going to be listening to me, they are more like friends for gaming and to hang around but I haven’t had a friend I’m comfortable talking to in almost 3 or 4 years and even they just sort of ignored me and one of them just was ashamed of being my friend and so I decided to cut them out. I have no one to talk to, my parents tell me to talk to god, which I’ve tried but doesn’t help. I can’t tell my grandma because I wouldn’t be able to manage myself and my sibling are all as unavailable and religious as my parents. My friends are not those kind of friends, I don’t trust them like that and the one I would trust have always ignored me or felt ashamed of me or they’re going through their own stuff. I just know that I’ve been through some stuff but I’ve always undermined it because I never thought of it as anything serious but maybe I’m just that weak."
depression,eventually im gonna end up killing myself,"i really just don’t know what to do with my life. i feel like my fate is to commit suicide, even if I don’t have interest in doing it now. it doesn’t help that i was born with high functioning autism, so it feels as if I’m always one step behind the rest of society. the average life span of someone with my disability is 51 years, solely due to suicide. im not doing anything remotely important with my life and it’s really just a matter of days till I give up. it also doesn’t help that my parents have been screaming and yelling at each other every night till 3 in the morning since like 6 months ago, and i don’t have the money to move out. I feel like my mental and physical health is spiraling downward and it’s almost inevitable that one day i am going to commit suicide."
depression,I am boring,"Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because they’re just consumed with darkness? I honestly feel bad sometimes for people who spend time with me, I’m just there but no really there it must be exhausting. I feel like nothing interests me like I can’t talk about anything because I dont have a book I like or anything."
depression,It really does get better,"Throwaway account because personal reasons..
Although this isn’t the standard post for this sub, but ~3 years ago I made a post on here about how terrible my depression was- the muck I was stuck in completely consumed me whole. I would stay in my bed for weeks, only going to school (not even everyday of the week) and literally nothing else. Constantly in my room, watching screens, forgetting to shower, days blurring into each other. Eventually my mom ended up taking me to seek professional help and I thought it was hopeless because I had heard that SSRI’s took weeks to work, and I wasn’t planning on waiting that long for it to work....after going to my doctor (and eventually therapist/psychiatrist) I wasn’t even myself, having to go into such detail about what I was going through made it even harder for me to cope with. Yes I’m feeling it but also I’m having to understand it?! It was a lot....I started taking medication and have been for the past 3 years. I’m in college, I’ve never felt more joy in my life (besides the pandemic) and it’s crazy to me that i had wrote on here talking about how meaningless my life was and here I am a year away from graduating! It even took a lot to write this so not everything is picture perfect but yeah... it’s a whole lot better."
depression,I feel like Prozac destroyed my sex life. Will coming off it help?,I've been reading some really scary stories about people having permanent ED and delayed/impossible orgasm after using Prozac.

depression,Not even once in my life,"Not once in my life did I manage to do something right from beginning to end. I found a new job last year, and I was a moron again. I already was a moron in school-always late and never doing any good work-and know I pretty much messed up the first few months of work that I had to do. People kept looking at me, because I got late. They talked about me because I was a mess. I had about 3 months prior to prepare myself. And what did I do? Spend those 3 months eating junk food and worrying about getting late, until I actually had to go there, and then I really did get late-for more than an hour. I'm so done with myself. I think I'll quit that job, I already hate it there."
depression,I like to sleep,I think I like to sleep too much. I go to bed early af.  (At least I wake up early.) I pretty much go to bed right after I have dinner and stuff. I think I like it because I don't have to think about anything bad.  I don't have to think at all.  Sleep is a blessing to a depressed person imo

depression,I think I’m gonna kill myself,"I think im gonna kill myself. Probably not tonight but maybe tomorrow or something.  School really makes me feel like death is the best option. 

I’m 18. I’m in my last year but I’ve barely done any work this whole time and it’s too late to make up all those assignments, I have no energy or motivation or anything. It’s like I’m empty or numb

I don’t want to tell anyone because I don’t have anything to tell, nothing bad is happening in my life or anything and I feel stupid and phony when I cry over absolutely nothing. It’s my fault and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

I had a plan to drop out and I would work towards getting my GED. I was happy with that but I told my mom and she yelled at me, now I’m scared so killing myself seems like the best way to go about this situation."
depression,So phenomenally tired,"I’m just so tired of being tired and depressed. I’m tired of feeling sorrow and despair. I’m tired of existing like this. 
I feel so starved of physical affection and happiness, blaming myself for everything that goes wrong. I’m so tired of letting everyone down. I’m so brain-crushingly lonely.

I understand the circumstances that make it not wholly my fault, but... it doesn’t seem to help my brain. Even with the quarantine and going-ons having a huge influence on the difficulties in my life, it doesn’t provide relief to know or acknowledge.

It still just feels like a deep emptiness and slowly spreading, a ticking clock of me shutting down completely. I’m so, so fucking tired."
depression,I'm falling apart,"I've been on a pretty deep downward spiral the past few weeks. It started when I got the results for a fanfiction writing contest I entered, which, I have to add, is pretty much my only hobby. I didn't think I was going to win, but from the positive feedback I got, I was certain I'd at least get an honorable mention. Spoiler alert: I didn't. One of the mentions went to a story that got a third as many likes as mine.
From there, I just plummeted. I put my mind to something, I did the absolute best I could, and it was all for nothing. I'm not even good at something I enjoy. I've never won at any kind of competition, no matter how hard I try. I'm forced to face the fact that I don't actually have any talents. My therapist tried to help, but he doesn't understand that, to me, the fun of making the story in the first place is just a crappy participation trophy. Nobody thinks you're interesting or cares about your hobby if you're not good at it. I certainly wouldn't want to be friends with a loser like me.
I know there's nothing that can be done, I just needed to vent."
depression,Antidepressants work well for me!,I started to use again and I feel much much better today it changed my mood. I am more optimist I smile more and more and think positively.

depression,Finding comfort in fictional characters,"Hi there!
This is my first post on reddit! Please let me know if I've broken any rules or made a mistake somehow - I'm new to this and happy to learn the ropes. 

I've been struggling with chronic, treatment-resistant depression for about 4 years now. I lot of my experience has to do with university and the difficulties of studying a degree I'm not interested in - happy to elaborate if people want to know. 

Anyway, as a teenager I was really into novels - I finished the hunger games in a week of school holidays after picking up the first book. I read pretty much every YA series there was a few years back.
Whenever there was conflict around me I managed to escape into the world of a book for a little while and it was a wonderful coping mechanism/outlet.

Over the course of the last few years I've stopped being able to read. I started to struggle with concentrating on the words, and books didn't play like a movie in my head anymore like they used to. After a couple of genuine efforts to get back into it I kind of just gave up.

Then this year during lockdown I bought myself a Kobo Forma (like a kindle but a different brand) and picked up a digital copy of Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson after a friend got herself a Kindle. Somehow something just clicked and I devoured three books over the course of two weeks.

Long story short, I'm halfway through the latest book of Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series and I wanted to post about the writing of Kaladin Stormblessed.

It's the first series I've ever read where the main character (Kaladin) has, and engages with, depression. For me, his experiences in the book really hit home on points like giving up, distancing yourself from others, hopelessness etc. 
Just reading through his story made me feel like there are other people in the world who genuinely understand what I'm going through. I almost feel like I have a friend who just gets it. 
I almost feel like I have something to hang on to when I'm struggling, like ""oh but Kaladin also goes through this so maybe I'm not being stupid/lazy/insane/irrational..."" 
It has been incredibly validating. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience with this series, or any other books? I'm interested to hear whether this is something that helps other people as well and if there are other really well-written characters in other books/TV shows/movies etc. That specifically deal with the lived experience of depression.


Tl/Dr : The writing of Kaladin in the Stormlight Archive book series made me feel less alone. Has anyone else has a similar experience?"
depression,Tired of everything,"I’m Asian, ugly, 20F, social anxiety, lost 2 jobs to COVID, sexually abused when I was 5 by female teen neighbor then 3 years later by an old male distant relative, bullied in 8th grade by my teacher’s assistant(gossips to other teachers about me that I was a horrible student even though I’m not), doesn’t go to college, went through a breakup, cousin’s mom hates me and my family because we’re poor and she’s wealthy already, and I’ve been depressed since I was 5. I almost drowned when I was 9 at the beach wish I just died there back then :/ I really want to die but I can’t because of my family and my one friend that always keeps in touch. I love them. I don’t want them to be sad. But just being alive is hell to me. I cry myself to sleep every night saying to myself that I wish I was never born. I also dreamt of ways on how to kill myself. I just do nothing and stay at home in my bed all day wasting my life and slowly rotting inside. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I want to sleep forever. I’m tired...I’m tired...I’m tired."
depression,Emotionally Detached From The World,"I can't really remember the last time in my life that I have been genuinely happy and don't see it forthcoming in my future. I always feel like I'm just moving through the motions of life with no real significance or meaning. I can't properly form relationships with people because I feel like I can never be myself unapologetically or confidently - which probably stems from my childhood. Furthermore, people can't understand my complexity and just label me as friendly, but mysterious. I grew up as an INFJ and turned into an INTJ as time progressed if that helps some of you.

Growing up, I was the youngest sibling and was pretty used to taking crap from my older sister and brother. However, I was also a little chunky since about 6 years old which made me an easy target for my parents to constantly belittle me and fat-shame me - even now (I'm 22). They always made slick comments and made harsh remarks towards my weight. Because of this I've always had serious body image issues, but never the motivation to change it. I was never bullied at school because I was the type of kid that was friends with everyone and could fit into any group, but that's because my bullies were at home. They continued to disregard my feelings and as I grew older the once vibrant/lively little boy I used to be grew colder as the years passed. 

Sports was a big cornerstone in my household considering that my siblings and I have all played baseball/softball since around the age of 3 (Neither parent did). I was a perfectionist and started disliking baseball once I got to high school and completely lost a passion to play my freshman year. Although I made really good grades and was even in the honors class, my parents were extremely pissed at me when I stopped showing up to practice and even tried to force me to continue playing. My parents instantly began insinuating that I was gay because I quit sports (little did they know I had been a closeted bisexual for a year already). I even offered to uptake other individual sports that allowed me to hone in on my perfectionism like track &amp; field, cross country and powerlifting, but they simply were too pissed to allow me to do so. I was super involved in leadership around campus but that wasn't even enough. My father didn't talk to me for 3 weeks before he told me that I was a piss poor excuse for a son and my mother would never advocate for me so she stayed silent. A few months later, they sent my sister to look through my phone in the middle of the night while I was sleeping when she came across a text convo with another girl in which I confessed that I thought I may be bisexual. My sister woke me up at 2 AM and proceeded to call me a fag and ran and showed my parents. My parents were crying and pissed trying to have a conversation with me in which I kept denying my sexuality and denying that I even sent that message. My entire family is very homophobic although they try to preach that they are progressive, ""accepting"" people.

Having all of this (and more) happen at such a young age, I never had an emotional relationship with anybody and I am very emotionally detached from everybody and everything. I've aways been the happy kid with a good head on his shoulders, but nobody ever saw the depth of darkness that surrounded me and still does. I fell into a deep depression in my junior year of college and never really recovered. I no longer have a desire to be friends with people I have known my whole life because I see myself as so much more open-minded and accepting than them. Now, I'm a 22 year old PhD student (still closeted) who is very emotionally numb, comfortable with death and doesn't believe in permanent happiness for myself. I avoid everybody any chance I get and get very miserable in the company of family and friends. I'm not sure how to get out of this deep hole but I'm also very content in it and have embraced my numbness, secrecy, complexity and value it more than anything now. Sorry for the long post but this is years of built up anxiety, self-hate and depression speaking."

The only time I feel happy for an extended period of time is when I'm under the influence. Kinda wish I never resorted to drinking but I stop feeling shitty.

I hate not being able to enjoy anything. At least I can still nut doe."

depression,My dad saw my self harm scars and I want professional help,"I had to get my blood drawn and he saw them. I don’t have many on my arms since I’ve been overly paranoid about anyone seeing them, but somehow he still saw them and he questioned me abt it. I gave a bullshit answer and he just went quiet and we never spoke abt it again. The thing is, I really want help. My family is rlly strict abt mental health and when my doctor proposed therapy for one of the conditions, my dad was immediately against it. Another example is when I cried at school because I had bottled everything up, my grandma told me I was a disgrace and that I was crazy and my dad told me I was the reason he hated existing. They were embarrassed and mad so it’s understandable. I just really want to talk to someone and I dunno this is getting sort of long but I’m just rly lost rn. My mom killed herself when I was nine and I don’t want to go the same way because I don’t want them to experience that guilt for a second time, but I’m so tired of existing. I cant stop thinking about ways to end myself, and I have a date ready and notes and everything but I don’t want to go it’s so weird. I feel bad knowing that if I disappear now they’ll feel responsible, but I rlly can’t do this anymore. Does anyone know how I can get help without my family knowing? I live in the US and I’m a minor."
depression,"cried lots and felt worse about myself when i realised i have to stay here for another year,,,, because the one show i like might be having another season with my fav character ever added back in. isn’t that sad?","this happened the other week. i was really suicidal then but i’m much better in comparison now. i wanted to die so bad. but there was this show that i watched a while ago and it genuinely made me so happy. every time i watched it i felt all the emotions and had a real connection with one of the [main] characters. they brought out a season 2 recently and my character wasn’t in there even tho he was the main. it was coz of irl problems regarding management issues but i was still upset that the character wouldn’t be in the second season,,, so i am still yet to watch it. then, i saw a clip from the end of season two. they teased that there could be a season three to the show, and my character could be coming back. i was seriously overjoyed. i couldn’t believe it. but then i instantly felt awful. it would be at least a year before the next season came out. “i have to stay another year on an empty promise?!” i would think to myself. “i have to stay just incase they have another season and incase they actually bring my character back?!? despite the fact they have irl issues why he couldn’t be there?!?” i honestly felt worse about everything. and it made me so upset that i felt like that so i just felt even more worse. isn’t that pathetic? ://"
depression,I’m cracking up,"Unwanted thoughts often suffocate me, but I’ve always been able to hide everything I feel in the inside, fake a laugh and simply ignore the whispers in my head telling me to kill myself. Nobody ever doubted that I’m hiding anything, not even my own family. If I ever seem sad people would be a bit surprised because it’s just so unlike “me”.

But over the past few years, the rain pouring inside of me started to slowly form an ocean and all I can do is helplessly stare at it as it swallows me alive. 

I have reached my limits.. I became so fragile that sometimes the comfort brought by taking a deep breath is enough to make me cry. I can’t control myself anymore.. I can’t hide, conceal, or fake anything. I feel like I’m always on the verge of crying and I keep having panic and anxiety attacks in public, mostly at school. 
I awfully broke down in front of my family once, It happened suddenly, my whole body was shaking and I couldn’t stop crying. My mother made fun of me after that and I felt embarrassed to the core.. I still feel ashamed for not being able to hold my feelings in that day.

I’m crumbling down. The walls I spent my whole life building are all falling down. My heart is beating outside my chest, and I can feel people’s stares piercing through it. I’m shattered now. My insides are flooding, and it’s all spilling out.

There’s a voice inside my head that never shuts up, “ Do it.” it whispers, “ let it go, let it all go. Take a step, jump into the blue, free yourself from the task of living.”
It used to scare me, I used to fight it back but I am genuinely exhausted now.

I just want to go home"
depression,Need advice and reassurance pls,"Hey all,
I (19,F) have recently been to an ER specialised in mental health. I've explained them that my depression has progressively worsen over the course of the last few weeks and that I didnt feel like I could make it through the next days.

I've also talked about the fact that my self harm was out of control and that I was having a suicide plan pretty established that consisted in defenestration (i live in the 6th floor)

They kept me one night, put me on Valium, and told me to leave. Wrote on the rapport that I was experimenting a mild episode, even though the team i saw the morning told it was severe.

I'm honnestly confused, and a little bit furious. I have the feeling that they didnt took me seriously, as given the fact that Im a young woman.

What does it takes to get proper help? Do I have to make a suicide attempt or be totaly psychotic to deserve help and get hospitalised?

Idk anymore."

depression,How do you cope with not having friends or a social life when you're young and missed out on normal social progression?,"A 22 year old shouldn't be saying ""I have no one to call to talk to or hang out.""

A 22 year old shouldn't be constantly wallowing in self pity and instead be enjoying his youth.

A 22 year old shouldn't being doing 95% of all normal activities alone

A 22 year old shouldn't be saying ""No one knows I exist. If i dissapeared it would take a long time for anyone to notice""

It is very worrying looking back and realizing ""I spent my birthdays in college alone in my appartment, while everyone else spent it with their friends.""

I go to the gym and work on myself, but for what? Being depressed is still going to send me to an early grave and no one will notice.

I'm too boring to date. What girl would want to date an emotionally starved and unstable loner who spends 80% of his time alone?

There are people at work my age. They talk about seeing their friends, I can't really relate.

I just feel weird and different.  I hope to one day get famous on social media one day, because maybe people will notice I exist.

Is there any point in trying to self improve? What exactly am I looking foreward to?

So much in my mind and I’ve tried everything, sleep stories and meditation and no screen etc, but then when I couldn’t sleep I opened my eyes to check the time and it was 4:30. I had laid in bed with my eyes closed for 3 hrs and didn’t even sleep. Now it’s too late to take something to sleep or I’ll miss my exam.

Idk how i got to this, i went from a 4.0 student that had like honors and AP classes nd shit and whos dream was to go to ucla and become a pharmacist, to this.

Quick history: dad had disease, died, I abused substances etc etc, always saw myself as a loser. disagnosed with major depression. Cycled meds etc. Lexapro helped with suicidal thoughts but still have much overthinking and negative self image.

What I came to think about tonight is depression seems to stem from what we want ourselves to be. Cool, smart, funny, etc. what I came to think about today is.. if you don’t have it you don’t have it. We trick ourselves into thinking we are ok, but really it will never be ok - right? The feeling of a roller coaster of I’m good and I’m shit never will really end and from childhood it’s been determined."
depression,A story of friends that just saved my life,[removed]
depression,What can I do for my depressed friend.,"Hey guys, I’d really like so advice or help in this very desperate time. I have a friend who is very depressed a lot is going on. The things she tells me, I just don’t know what to say, im absolutely speechless. When I do say things it never does anything at all, and she gets very upset with me. I try to understand everything and I do understand how she feels. She claims I don’t listen or understand her because when she says she can’t do it or tells me how she feels, I try to make her feel better and comfort her and I tell her she can get passed these hard times and to keep trying and to just stay here and that I care about her and I’m by her side, I’m trying. We dated for a while too, and she broke up with me a month or two ago due to her mental health. She says if things don’t get better she can’t do it anymore, Anything I say doesn’t effect her at all, it just makes her upset with me because I can’t help, she has no hope or any confidence things will get better. And I’m getting more anxious every day that something bad might happen. I don’t know what to do, I’m confused and I need some help myself."
depression,I told my mom I wish i had never been born,"Ive had discussions with her about feeling depressed and feeling worthless, but she always finds ways to try and make me feel guilty about it. Sometimes she will say stuff like how she prays for people that commit suicide because their souls are damned for eternity. Which is a load of crap but whatever rows her boat I guess. She disregards my depression and labels it as pure laziness because i no longer care enough to continue any hobbies outside of just ""sitting on my ass during my free time"" or put effort on my appearance. It's a miracle that i at least have the energy to pry myself out of bed to shower and force myself to go do a job i hate every day all while feeling a sense of dread of having to go through the motions for another day. I told her that i find no valid reason to have been born and she just made it about herself. Then said god had a reason for letting me live since i wasn't supposed to actually be born in the first place due to complications during the pregnancy. And i responded with ""well id sure like to know because so far it all feels pointless"".  She says to go get help, but also talks trash about the prospect of having to take meds."

depression,Is there a type of high functioning depression...,"...or are people just assholes to me?

Every time I try to bring up having depression when I talk to my mother, she either dismisses me (""everyone has depression these days, does it even matter anymore?”) or says she's depressed too as if my cry for help is just asking for special treatment and she wants to feel special too.

While I don't deny that she could have depression (she denies I have it though :))) it makes me wonder, because she just can't stop and keeps going.... is this really something that happens? my type of depression is the one that makes me not leave my bed sometimes or makes me feel like I wanna sleep all day and not do anything at all. Are there people who really are capable of functioning semi normal while depressed? or is my depression more severe? or is she saying that to feel special? 

anyway, depression deniers fucking suck and they are to blame for contribution. you can't look at a person with pneumonia and say they're pretending..... why do neurotypical people think we're just being dramatic? mental illness is real and undeniable but folks who have never even been close to experiencing depression act like they know everything about it"
depression,Some doctors have no fucking clue what they’re talking about sometimes.,"I’m very specific about who I want to talk to, because some of these doctors have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to mental health stuff. Today my day started off crappy because someone who isn’t usually my doctor called me about a check up on my new meds. Of course this was an inconvenience, but I thought I’d give her a chance and let her deal with it. She kept saying things like “this is temporary” and “it’ll pass”. I know she meant well and she sounded nice, but seriously? Why would you say that to someone who has been clinically depressed for years. I literally just wanted another subscription of my meds and there she is trying to fix me with one phone call. At one point she actually said, “maybe paint your nails”... paint my nails? Paint my fucking nails? Seriously, lady? Yeah, that’s what’s been the problem all these years. I’ve been forgetting to paint my nails. She also said stuff like about how I should walk outside, which I get can be helpful, but the whole point of me being depressed and having anxiety is the fact that it stops me from going outside because I hate outside. That’s why I need the meds and therapy. Anyways, I feel bad because I know she meant well, I’m just annoyed because I haven’t slept well and this phone call just irked me. Of course I was nice to her though and said thank you, but next time I’m going to ask she send me back to my usual doctor. I’ve had a bad experience in this GP before too with another doctor basically telling me that my depression wasn’t real and that I was only 18 and it would “pass” when I went to university. Well, it’s 4 years later, I dropped out of uni and I’m still fucking depressed."

I have a tendency to avoid big topics (unconsciously - I struggle with vulnerability) and this is something that i’m really unsure about so I would have a hard time bringing it up"
depression,Coming back home after first year of University,"This is a throwaway account. 

The first time I ever felt depressed was probably at the start of my teenage years, it wasn't quite bad until I reached the last few years of high school, feeling a lot of pressure to do well in my studies. My parents never really forced me to do really well, regardless I also felt like I had to be the best of the best due to my older sibling being the ""smartest"" of them all, and also being the top at school. I also felt like I needed to be the same as them. I always wonder to myself if i'm being selfish or do I have the right to feel like this? In honesty, no one is forcing me to be at the top of everything, but myself. 

I honestly feel like I'm not allowed to feel this way because no one else is pressuring me to do well in my studies but ME? That i'm trying to feel sorry for myself? for being a complete dumb shit who doesn't know what she's supposed to fucking do in this world. I have loving parents (but I feel they dont understand what I'm feeling and dont provide enough support, being how 'old-style' they are) and friends who support me the best way they can. Sorry if i'm not making any sense with this.

I think the one of the best things that I did in my life was to move out of my parents home for University (even though it costs so much fucking money, ah student loans) and feel some sort of independence. Now I'm back home for the summer and i miss being independent, and I feel my depression coming back. I'm getting short-tempered, sayings things that should've been said in a different way, or completely being rude without realizing it. To let you know I just did a premed year and failed 2 Uni papers for the first time. Yes, I feel like a complete shit and stupid person for not even passing, so my med dreams are no where to be found. I quite jealous of my peers who are also doing something similar as me who are getting to where they want in life and they dont even have to try? Or maybe because I don't fully see what goes behind the scenes in their life, so who am I to judge right? 

I havent told my parents my failure so i'm hiding it by moving to another degree and saying that I need to complete this other degree because it will help with graduate entry for medicine.This means that I will have to change to a different degree because i don't meet the prerequisites for the second year and wasted a year over two papers. I'm trying to deal with this the best way I can by staying positive, but being back at my parents house is not helping. I love them but I need my space. I'm wondering if its okay to feel this way? Am I even fit to become a medical professional? I really love working with people and helping people improve their lives. WHy does life have to be so hard even if you are trying the best that you can, but it is never enough?"
depression,I feel shitty about how the titles here are so fucking relatable,"I on my lowest low.

I'm 22, and I deal with depression for the last 5 years. I feel like I'm about to lose my job because I'm not able to even wake up or do my regular stuff like taking a shower, and it leads to more stress.

Fuck, I can't even think of words to describe the reasons, feelings, and thoughts. It's just unbearable"

I felt so comforted by him at time and he was very caring idk what to think or do but this is innaceptable i told him we wont talk anymore and i wished him good luck because as far as i know he isnt feeling too good either but now i wanna cry so bad and hit myself to open up for once only for this to happen

I work 9 hours, then i play chess and then go to sleep, this is my routine for the past month, chess is only way for me to be awake and not to think ablut how horrible my life is."
depression,It's difficult for me to fathom that there's people who wake up and don't want to die.,"I have thought since 5th grade that the way my life will end is from suicide. I have nothing of value in my life and no reason to live. Frankly I will probably kill myself immediately after I graduate college since by then I will know life is truly not worth living. I don't care about my major so I'm not even serious about getting a job in that field, but I still do my work so that my parents don't bug me about it. For some reason, I have lost any goals or aspirations I used to have. I just don't feel there is any point in doing anything. I seriously just feel like I'm wasting my life going to college but it's all I have now, since it pretty much killed my previous hobbies. Yet I gain nothing from it.

Pretty much I just endulge in escapism the best I can by consuming various media but as soon as soon as I have to come to terms with reality again due to responsibilities I immediately want to kill myself. I fantasize ways to go about killing myself, yet for some reason I am terrified to go through with it. Not because I'm afraid of dying, I believe death is literally just not existing, which is how it was before we were born. The reason I am scared is due to pain. Even if it's for a few minutes, it just seems so unpleasant. All the options of suicide I have researched seem to still cause pain when I simply want to not exist. If I have a gun I would've probably shot myself years ago, but I don't have one unfortunately. I am actually quite mad at my parents for bringing me into this world as if it's worth living. I can't even have a normal sleep schedule since for some ridiculous reason I haven't been able to sleep properly for all my life. Any therapists/sleep medicine/anti-depressants haven't worked whatsoever. 

It's hard for me to fathom that there is anyone who is geniunely happy or anyone who wakes up without wanting to kill themselves. But realistically, I am probably unhappy because I don't have any friends. First year of college, I made zero friends. None whatsoever. I'm not even sure how one goes about making friends. And I feel like I don't want any friends either, I deleted all social media since I have pretty much accepted I have no use for it. I now take online classes for college due to the pandemic so I feel my chances of forming friendships with other students went from 1% to 0%. Haven't had a girlfriend since I was 16, and she has now ghosted me for 3 years.  It was probably the only time I felt like someone geniunely cared about me. I am so pathetic I still think of her since I haven't moved on/found someone else while she has. I am unable to interact with even my dad or my brother. I honestly don't think I would cry if anyone I knew died since I just feel numb at this point. It is impossible for me to care about anything. Only reason I'm typing this out is because I can't sleep. I wish I could live as a hermit and go the rest of my life without interacting with anyone, just endulging in escapism until I die."
depression,Have you ever told your friends you tried to kill yourself? Or that you have depression?,[removed]
depression,Don’t know where to turn,The only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I know what it would do to my family. I know they care about me and want the best for me. I just can’t help it that I hate myself so god damn much. I truly hate every fiber of my being. I don’t want my family to feel like they’ve failed me because they really tried.

My life is shit and has fallen apart.

Few months ago i lost my flat, i have nowhere to go, i have also built thousands in debts just trying to survive, my mental health is so bad I can't work but then no work means no money. We are currently going from one hotel room to another and last night, we ran out of money.

I've had counciling, fucking shit. 
Each time I called a doctor regarding my mental health, they spend 3 minutes on the phone and prescribe me a new tablet, which 1. Doesn't work and 2. Shows they really don't give a fuck and just want you off the phone.

I've borrowed from friends and family in the last week just to keep me going, but now I've ran out of options.

There's nowhere I can stay other than the street.

I feel like this could be the start of my homelessness.

Life has no meaning any more. Honestly, what am I living for? Debts? Mental illness? Working a shit job I hate for next to nothing money? A awful relationship with my family? 

I have 3 hours before I have to check out of this hotel and I think it could be my last 3 hours alive on this vile world.

I appreciate this post is a lot of waffling and not the best structured but I think it's something I needed to get out before the end of the road.

If anyone can read this and give me a genuine reason to live, I'm all ears but I certainly can't think of one.


There's a chance this might not even be seen before it's time  so whether it's too late or never seen, I hope everyone here seeks and gets the help the require.

Specifically: Sad mood, loss of interest of once enjoyed activities, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, and thoughts of suicide. My family also thought I had depression so I consulted some websites, most said that I need to get off my phone and meet people, but... no. I would consult my parents, but they’re Catholic, so they would say “pray to God” or some shit like that. Me, I’m not “fully” atheist, I believe there’s a chance in God, but it’s all just confusing to me, since I debunk stuff from logic, and well... not a lot of logic is in Catholicism. So I just need help. I wanna stop feeling sad, but I don’t know how and I don’t know why I’m sad In the first place and I just don’t know if I’m faking depression just to feel dramatic. and I’ve been getting very unlikeable in a way where I ruin everything with negative comments.

It took me years to finally figure out that my brain is a wreck, I have multiple mental issues, including the depression. I have a strong feeling inside that I have severe ADHD, after a few months of research. Not officially diagnosed. I may also be on the spectrum yet I'm not too sure on that one. Either everyone was oblivious during my childhood, or they just lied and never told me the truth. I've always been the punching bag, never taken seriously. The only real friend I've ever had was in 5th grade, and we only hung out because we were the ""rejects"" that everyone else made fun of. I was bullied all the time in school, I had horrible grades, and I always fell asleep because it was too hard to pay attention. I was the ""quiet kid"" because I was too afraid to open up, still am. I try to make friends on the internet but I keep pushing them away, either because I'm paranoid that they'll turn me away first, or because I act on impulse without thinking and do/say the wrong things that make others think I'm dumb, insensitive, rude, etc. I've even been called a narcissist, that hit me like a truck. Parents always think that I'm lazy, being awake is exhausting. Overall, I have no motivation to do anything, hobbies feel like chores, so I've abandoned those. Lately I've been starting to have suicidal thoughts, attempted cutting a few days ago but I couldn't even get it through. These thoughts keep racing in my mind everyday, I don't know, thought I would vent it out on here. I'm currently high writing this, laying on a couch in a dark room with only Christmas lights. Send me some love."
depression,Would talking about it change something ?,"I have been planning to talk to someone about my social anxiety and depression , but I am not sure if I'm even depressed . I lack the word and honnestly don't see what talking about it will change .
Got some advice ? 
I feel like something is missing but I don't know what or what place that thing is supposed to have in my life . Can you tell me how your life as changed when you got help (or simply recovered somehow ) ?"
depression,I think it’s all too much and one day I’ll decide it’s the right day to end it all.,"I had to leave my job six months ago because it was negatively affecting my mental health in an extreme way. My doctors, friends, and family told me they thought it would be a good idea to take some time off and seek help.

So I did. My partner and I had quite a bit in savings and I felt comfortable taking some time for myself. My doctors wanted some testing and therapy done to get a firm diagnosis for treatment. It’s taking forever. They’re scheduling things months out. I’m seeing a therapist in the meantime, but she spent our last session yawning when I would talk then telling me about her problems.

My partner got sick and had to miss quite a bit of work which caused us to use a large chunk of savings. Things are looking bleak. I was hoping the government would issue the stimulus checks they’ve been talking about for months to give us some padding financially while I get these tests done. As of this morning, the news says they’re not going to do that anymore.

I’m going to have to go back to some kind of job before anyone believes I can mentally handle it. I don’t want to feel the way I did at my last job. I’m very seriously considering taking my own life to save my loved ones from the burden of caring for me. Life is dark and I fall asleep every night hoping I won’t wake up."
depression,I feel like I’ll fail my masters course,"I started my masters course in September and everything was going well. I was motivated and excited. Until November came, it stated getting cold and my depression started getting worse. I’ve been taking Sertraline for about a year now and it has helped me a lot. I literally thought to myself “wow, I think I’ll be able to get off the medication soon”. Until November came. My depression does get a lot worse during this time when it’s a lot darker and colder. And I feel like I can’t cope anymore. 

I work part time as well so I can support myself financially, and with my mental health getting worse, I find it a lot difficult to complete my university assignments. I feel like a failure. I thought I was getting better but then my depression was like “I ain’t gone yet” and everything just collapsed. Now all my intrusive thoughts are coming back like I’m a failure in life and I won’t achieve anything so what’s the point. My suicidal thoughts were gone for a while, but I’m
Noticing them slowly creeping in. I’m tired of always being like this. Can I even achieve anything in life if I’ll always be struggling to meet deadlines? 

I don’t know... I’m stressed and I’m tired and I feel like I’m on a path to failing my masters."
depression,I feel extremely lost. (Mainly a vent),"I can’t help but feel lost and numb I’m only 15 and yes I have a lot have time ahead but I don’t think I’ll make it I fake a smile almost everyday, I’m scared of crying in front of others so I cry by myself almost every night, I don’t have friends not even one, and I’m just really fucking lonely I want someone to talk to but I’m worried of bothering others I have really bad anxiety and my personality is crap I’m always nervous even around people I know (family, parents, and yeah) I get called names almost everyday just reminding me how I’m fat, trans, ugly, and just other crap I’m so tired of it."
depression,Tired,"I’m tired. I feel like this depression has lasted me five years now. It hasn’t but that’s how deep it feels. Everyday I am sad. Everyday I have to force myself to go to work because how else will my bills get paid? Everyday I have to find what little energy I have left in me to do the basics: eat, shower, and walk my dog. I am tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I can’t take this anymore. There’s has never been a solid two days where I’m happy. Always carry that little saddness in me. The only thing holding me back is the thought of leaving my younger sibling alone. But I don’t know much I can take it. This saddness is overwhelming and I just don’t have the energy in me to keep going. I want a way out. I want to be at peace. Maybe not even at peace but just not here anymore. I don’t want to deal with the thoughts and the ache. I’m just ready to go away."
depression,"After struggling for 30 years, I think I'm finally able to explain what my depression feels like.","Like a tree in a hurricane, and my roots don't grow deep.

I grab hold to anything I can find, but I'm tired of searching for things to hold on to.

The hurricane is forever stalled overhead. Some days it's stronger than others. But I realize there's nothing that can be done about that. 

And my roots never grow.

Why won't these stupid roots just fucking grow?!"

depression,I was born to be a slave for my parents,"I (17M) am being treated pretty much like a slave by my parents, can't say no to anything they ask me to do, have to help them even if I don't want to and worst of all, if I do something and my dad doesn't like how I did it, he just calls me lazy and says stuff about me being weak and that I don't know how to do anything

I literally say no multiple times whenever they ask me to do something I don't want to do, but after they FORCE me to go and help, I'm useless all of a sudden and am there to make things harder for them

I used to talk to my best friend about this but now she takes forever to respond to me and I'll be calm by the time she does

Someone please end my suffering"
depression,Here this is for you,"For everyone feeling alone: you have a place to go   
for everyone wearing long sleeves: your worth everything to me 

for everyone that cries their self to sleep: I know that feeling and it’s really deep 

for everyone who self harms: cutting can lead to a world of sadness to a world of love 

to everyone with DID: love your personalities 

for everyone just like me: we will get through this week with no pain or sadness we will have happiness and love 

so just know that your not alone I have depression to it’s hard to deal with. self harm Is something I do everyday but your safe with me if you have depression please talk to a loved one or someone who isn’t abusive at all I care about you and I want you to be safe  love your scars cause they only make you stronger 💖"
depression,Those who work full time do you have major issues with socializing with your coworkers during depressive states?,"I manage to hold a full time job while still dealing with major depression, but socializing can be incredibly difficult for me during my downtimes.

Basically I need someone to carry the conversation or else I will appear quiet and disinterested. And while I'll do my best to give everyone a friendly greeting, that's about all I have in me unless someone wants to help carry it further.

I want to be alone, but I welcome company that actually cares (most will not). So I am probably seen as the miserable quiet looking person at work that is nice somedays. I'm not sure when this will change again, but I know that I wasn't always this way."
depression,Paradoxes I don't understand,"Here are some emotions/paradoxes I don't understand









1_ I want everyone to notice me, but I want to be alone and unnoticed. It hurts when people ignore me but when they try to talk to me I feel exhausted and can't keep up.


2_I really want to be productive but I don't want to do anything.


3_ I know I'm not ugly but my brain says I'm an ugly monke


4_ I have the highest grades in school, still feel like a failure


5_ I want to stay awake all the time and want to sleep all the time


6_ idc if I'm not doing anything productive, but then I feel bad about not doing anything. Like I'm disappointing my family.


7_ wanting to die but being too afraid of suicide


8_ seeing how much mom cares about me makes me want to live for her and die so she won't suffer more


9_ I want to trust others but I'm too scared to do that and I really need someone to talk, afraid of losing my friends


10_ I want to go explore the world and I don't want to get out of my room"
depression,Concerts ill prolly never get to go too,"It sucks coz I like lots of bands that aren't from australia (where I live) and aren't popular enough to travel to Aus. I dont have enough money to travel just for converts and won't for ages and I have no one to go with which is fine but then travelling alone seems freaky af (fem)

depression,i just want it to stop,"i feel so sad and lonely and everything hurts. the only thing that helps is sleep, i hate this so much i just want this feeling to stop."
depression,Shit I don't tell my therapist,"I'm it's a ramble 

All those things I can't tell my therapist... 

1) that every single inch of my body is telling me kill myself,  it's like a war between the sane and the insane..between being logical and not logical,  and thinking with my heart or my head.  My heart wants me gone.  

2) I tried to kill myself a week ago and I won't tell them because they'll put me in hospital. 

3) when we talk about traumatic events I am hurting so bad and want to break down and cry and scream and hit things,  but I won't let myself because I don't want to inconvenience them. My therapist today told me she would be happy for me to cry for the whole 60 minute session and that it was OK,  I said no it's not lol.  

4) The more they try to analyse me and every movement I make,  it makes me not want to open up and share about my life.  

5) there's stuff I want to talk about because I know I haven't healed, but I'm too scared to bring it up.  

6)im afraid I'm wasting their time. No matter how much you say I'm not I don't believe them. 

7) sometimes I imagine my parents dead and how different it would be and all the things I would be allowed to do. Just to be clear,  I do not want them dead..  But my brain is fucked up and things of these things.  

8) sometimes I just have this urge to let go of the steering will in my car and just crash. I almost drove into a pole the other day and then logic kicked in and I slammed on the breaks because I love my car.  

9) even know I smile,  I'm really not doing good and I don't know if you pick up on this or not but sometimes I feel brain dead.  Like nothing is in there.  

10) I'm scared of your judgement if I tell you something and you don't get it."
depression,I literally have no one.,Who am I supposed to go to when I don’t have anyone to go to in my life because of just not having friends or family due to no contact or contact broken because of how I am. Everyday I just get closer to just ending it all and I keep hearing I need to see someone to talk about my problems I have my therapist but I just get the feeling it’s just a money thing with them because it just sounds so generic what he says it doesn’t feel genuine.
depression,I’m just tired,"I’m still only in high school but from what people have told me, it doesn’t get much better after. If high school is as emotionally draining as this, what’s the point of working 40 years for a job I probably won’t even like? I’ve lost all motivation for not only school but for everything else around me. I’ve lost all my friends and i’ve isolated myself from my family and whenever I feel my worst I steal my dad’s whiskey to hopefully take the pain away for a few hours. I want to have hope that it will get better but everywhere I look it’s all the same and I just wish I was never born. I’m not really looking for advice I just wanted to vent."
depression,Memory loss and depression,"Hey guys, I will make it quick.

I started taking antidepressants around a month and a half ago,they're working but they didn't bring me back to the person I was, I am just a bearable versione(which I appreciate tho). Everything started a few months ago around June all of a sudden one day I felt completely another person,never tried anything like this,ever. This happened after a night of binge drinking(I am quite used to bing drinking even though I diminished my intake a lot(I would do it 2/3 times a month,never everyday). 

Anyway along with my depression I started experiencing memory loss,the thing was that I wasn't confused or what but during a conversation I would definitely forget what I was talking about; I woke up without knowing what day was and where I was, I didn'recognize the world around me sometimes. That was pretty scary and that's mostly why I started taking antidepressants(obviously there was more stuff but this was the most problematic issue). 

Then,I would know if anybody experienced severe memory loss during depression(even though it is not related to feeling confused or dizzy) and if that will subside someday. I am pretty worried that more than depression this concerns a damage I did to myself by my alcohol abuse (21 years old anyway). I would be happy if anybody shared their experiences about memory loss and how they overcame it. Also,if somebody had a website that can calculate if your memory has really been damaged or not,post it below please."

depression,Unsuccessfully getting help is draining my energy and money,"I've been trying for 6 months now to get help. Self solutions don't work. I keep being passed around doctors and therapists. The only productive thing they do is change my medication once in a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far I've been stuck in this goddamn loop:

&amp;#x200B;

* I go to private therapist. They say I need a psychologist or psychiatrist assessment, and I can only do that through the doctor
* I go to doctor, and they said they ""don't see why I need that"", and referred me to CBT therapy.
* I go to CBT therapy, they say that they can't help me and that I should call a hotline.
* I call a hotline, they say I need a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting to feel hopeless, like this is going to be never-ending. I'm putting so much energy and effort into trying to get better, but things just get worse. I end up poorer and sadder than before. I at least have people that care about me, which is what's keeping me going this far, but they don't have the power to do anything. I'm so lost."

depression,How do i live a normal life?,"English is not my(F26) first language, but i did study English literature but please forgive any grammar mistakes i do. 

I’ve been battling with my depression ever since i moved from europe to asia (11 years ago) At first i didnt know it was depression, it made it even worse that my family called me lazy. We live in a place that is dominated by heat, so usually people take showers twice a day. I couldnt bring myself to do that, it was hard enough getting out of bed. My room is a mess a perfect reminder of my life. Altough i never harmed myself i used to hit myself on my legs especially, until it was bruised. It felt good to release my anger on me instead on others.

I wanted to die, but was afraid of the pain, so i wished to die peacefully like in my sleep. (I dont want to die anymore, but i do sometimes wonder what is my purpose on this earth? Wouldnt it be better to have never been born?) 

Covid just made things slightly worse, as now the money is a problem as well, i am of germqn citizenship, so finding work here was a challenge as well. My sisters both changed their citizenship, i just couldnt bring myself to do it, it felt like losing a part of me. 
I used to work in a resort, but thanks to covid i was let go, the resort closed, my bf (30) helps out a lot, financially wise, its his saving as we used to work in the same resort. 

I tried to explain him once how i felt, how things sometimes are difficult for me that seem so easy. Embarrassed to say i sometimes dont even find it in me to brush my teeth in the morning. 

But i see everyone around me living life so easily, how can i do it? Why is it so easy for some but so hard for me? Where did i go wrong? I feel like missing out on my 20s, i’m afraid of waking up one day and regretting that i never lived my life. 

Therapist are expensive and there is no healthcare here that covers it. 

Sorry for ranting, and sorry if this doesnt make any sense at all."

I had always wanted to go abroad to study computer science but I enrolled in civil engineering and now my dad is just taking my decision on his own. He is so stubborn. My exam is about to start and I can't study and sleep peacefully. He just talks over phone unnecessarily and I feel so disturbed and I asked several times not to disturb but he doesn't listen. Today i told I will sleep and study in the garage. He denied and said he will not disturb as usual. And he talks unnecessary things about my life, about my marriage with relatives. He is just forcing me to have civil egineer as my girlfriend. I have no girlfriend because i don't feel like to have one. I feel so disturbed and fucked up. While going somewhere I have to drop him and go wherever he want. I can't take decision and cant enjoy my life peacefully. I am just tired of just breathing in the name of living life. I feel so alone and lonely. I just felt I needed to say this somewhere and I don't feel like talking this stuff with my friends or anyone physically. Thank You for your time."

Theres 2 years till I leave my house and theres a million things I wish I'd done or got to do but I feel like I squandered any opportunity to make any friends, learn any hobbies that I wish I had, or just generally not be a social recluse with no social skills or academic skills.

I wish I could redo all of this and redo this pathetic attempt at life.

I wish I was born into better circumstances and a better area. I constantly fantasize about how my life would be better if I had been born elsewhere or how it would be better if I just was a better person for most of it.

depression,My life is over,"\- I have been this way for most my entire life. I have had parents who are racist and bigoted and rather believe someone else over me. 

\- I work in a crummy job that people don't listen to me at all.

\- I have no friends or people my age or anyone to listen to me. I also live in a crummy town that has absolutely nothing.

\- No matter what I say or do, nobody cares to listen to me. Plus, I am jealous of people who have good things happen to them and even though when I work for it, it is never good enough for anyone.

\- I feel like sometimes I wish I was never born and everyone would be happy about it. All I am is a burden and a waste of space in life. 

\- Nobody wants to me at all what is going on with me. All they say is 'I know' or 'I understand' or 'Here's a number' without really hearing me.

I truly think I was a waste of air to people and wished that maybe if I was gone, people would be happy. Besides, no one ever really cared about me anyway"

depression,why is it so hard for me to shower,[removed]
depression,I dunno,"i’m currently laying on my bedroom floor, unable to get the energy to take the three steps to my bed and fall asleep. I have to wake up in 3 hours. oh well, I never sleep nowadays. I used to be able to escape life in my sleep, but now all of my dreams just examine my life in greater detail, leaving me even lower than the night before.

I’m an 18 year old guy from utah, currently attending college. i’m a perfectionist, and have always done pretty well academically, but have no energy to act on the impulses. for example, at the start of the year I was taking more credit hours than necessary for full time, but I had to drop classes because I couldn’t focus in class, let alone even find the motivation to attend. lose-lose situation. either i hate myself for failing a class, or i hate myself for dropping a class. hooray. everything is online, so I have no social interaction. my few “friends” from high school have completely disappeared and stopped responding to me. I currently have no friends. 0. no irl friends, no internet friends, not even any imaginary friends—those just make me long for something real now.

i’ve been depressed for over 5 years now, each month getting lower and lower. last summer I did an experiment to see how many people would text me first. I spent a month not initiating any text conversation. I received 1 text. and they were asking for a favor. I have had suicidal thoughts (and plans) for years, and I actually acted on one a few months ago. unfortunately my parents found me. but that’s a long, unnecessary story. if i’m being honest the reason i’m here tonight is because I have the urge to act on it again. I just hate everything about myself. I hate how I look, what my voice sounds like, how my life is playing out. everything. i’ve been on various medications for months, and i’ve been in and out of therapy. nothing helps.

my girlfriend broke up with me a month or so ago because I wasn’t religious enough. no joke. everything else was great. we were happy and fit together great, I though that maybe my life was turning around. then she surprised me one day and ended it because I wasn’t as religious as her. she knew this from the start. I never asked her to give up her values or activities. I never asked her to choose me over religion. all I asked her was to love me for who I am. guess that’s just too hard. I did everything I could to make her happy. I made every compromise because she “couldnt.” everything. I guess i’m just not enough. i’m not enough for anyone. anything. i’m just a total failure. I like to think that i’m not rude or selfish or egotistical or inconsiderate or anything like that. I do my best to never judge people. I accept everyone around me. i’m always willing to help others and give up everything if it means that i’m able to make someone else happy. I see people I know and have given everything to help in the past getting married and having interesting lives, I just feel left out and like a failure.

two years ago I had another relationship with a girl. I knew she was way out of my league, but we had always been relatively close, so I didn’t think twice about it. long story short, she ended up using me to pay for everything and drive her everywhere. she cheated on me twice. that was a great time.

I just don’t understand what i’m doing wrong. I don’t understand why i’ve never been able to have any real, long term friends. why i’ve always just been used in my past relationships. why I always feel left out, and like everyone jokes about me behind my back. does anyone know what i’m doing wrong? is there some secret thing I had to do when I was 12 to be seen as human? i’m convinced that it has to be me. i’m willing to take any suggestions. any criticisms. 

obviously this is just brushing the surface but I already feel like a jerk for wasting your time, if you’ve read this far. and if you have? thank you. thank you for listening to me rant and complain. I’ve never asked for help or posted anything like this before. i’ve never wanted to waste anyone else’s time, and i’ve always felt like a coward. I just didn’t have the energy to fight it tonight. so thank you."

depression,Eating Disorders from Depression,"It started as me drinking to drown my sorrows the past month or so, worsening in the past week due to personal events that lead to me drinking so much that i blacked out and lost an entire day, I've never in my life drank like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've still alcohol here.. but new issues have cropped up where a DR has pointed out during all this I've formed 2 eating disorders..  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) as well as Purging disorder.   


I've been with friends where I've maybe picked at food a tiny bit then hope they don't notice i entirely stop, when i try to eat more than my stomach is used to i get uncomfortably full and it begins to hurt.. then i do what i can to purge it.. AKA I'm lactose so I'll drink milk or eat something i know my body hates and will reject.. that also being alcohol on occassion.  


Honestly I've emotionally lost all of my fight, I've lost it before, many times.. but bounced back within weeks-month and been back to my old self, but this has been a constant spiral and the thing hurting me has pushed me to a point where i don't have the energy to return, nor do i think i want to..  


I've avoided my family, i've not spoken to my son in weeks and feel its better off i don't get in touch, he hasn't seemed to notice anyway?.. seems everything i love has fallen away from me and I'm just slowly killing myself..

depression,.,"
i truly believe no one else feels and thinks like i do. i feel so alone in such a huge world of people. No one is real everyone acts like bots. i don’t know how to feel normal again. i am not meant to be here. who cares if i get everything i want. its not enough. i will never be happy no matter who i am or where i am. i shouldn’t be a waste of a form of life. i literally can’t understand why the universe put me here. i am too different from everyone. i don’t know why this soul chose me to be here. to live this lifetime. i have tried to put good things out in the world i never receive anything back. i have asked the universe for help. nothing. i have begged to all those watching over to help my girlfriend to get better. i have prayed on my knees to the moon and stars to give me a sign, nothing. i am at my lowest point again i’m in this deep hole and i really can’t get out this time. i hate this place, there’s too many evil stupid people. why does no one see the world like i do??? social media is truly evil for those who look up to it to be themselves it has changed every person’s personality i know once you get hooked you change. i’ve seen my friends become demons. i don’t trust anyone maybe that is the lesson my spirit is pushing me to learn but i can’t dude. what will it matter im dead in the end anyways. i am constantly shut down by circumstances in my life no matter what. why did my soul choose for me to endure this life i don’t understand what the universe wants from me i’m stuck and i can’t get over this frustration i am going in fucking loops and at the same time i feel like i’m in a fucking dream that never ends this pain will never end i’m so tired of being sick of humanity because they’re fucking dumb as rocks bruh

i ruined everything i literally fucking ruined everything. it was so fucking good it was great it was amazing. and then bad shit happened on like 5 different occasions and i died and broke my brain everytime bc i mentally can’t take emotional pain because of having a traumatizing past. i felt like i could be safe with 1 person but when they’re black out drunk and start yelling at me like a demon has taken their body over from the underworld and is speaking manipulative shit in to my head from HELL,
just demonic horrible mind stripping  soul killing heart drop to your stomach head aching things that someone who loves you would never say “you really think someone like me ever would love you” “you think i loved you this whole time i faked it”
repeating all the same type of things to make it seem like my fault just literally everything at once is thrown at me i would say it just really hit me hard and haunted me so bad and every time this happens she says she doesn’t remember. i can’t be hurting anymore like i’m literally going to drop dead whether it’s intentional by suicide or if its from a broken heart i cant deal with any more brain damage pain theres a fucking knife being jabbed in me as slow as possible i don’t feel like finishing this i just dont know what else to say"
depression,I feel like I'm doomed,"I ""woke up"" an hour ago, assuming I had even slept but I'm uncertain. Upon becoming more conscious, the first and only thought I could think of is questioning if I am doomed. I keep a journal to record my thoughts, which I had started doing recently, and I figured I would share what I had written to the internet, though I'm convinced nobody will really read it. I may or may not omit some things, I haven't decided.

Before I get started, I'd like to give a little background to who I am.
I'm a 25 year old line cook, and I like to believe I'm fairly good at my job. It's probably one of the few productive things that I'm actually good at, so I've maintained and improved my work skills over the past five years. Two weeks ago today, I had gotten COVID and luckily avoided many negative thoughts because I was too sick to focus on anything. I have recovered enough to return to work today.
But I think I'll just get started now.

______________________________

AM I doomed? Am I going to continue this path until I'm dead? Is there no way out of my financial hole, where I could possibly achieve some of my dreams and live the life I want, instead of barely scraping by and being forever in debt?
I'm starting to think-- well, not starting, but I think I'm fucked.

I don't think I'm ugly. I don't think I'm necessarily unfortunate in many cases. I'm fairly skinny, tall, and despite my glasses that make my eyes look huge, I've got that going for me. I have a family that loves me, even if it's only immediate.
But I feel like that's it.

I have few friendships, and I believe that the number is few because I'm a bad friend. I miss my dad (who had died ten years ago), partly because I feel like he could have taught me more on how to be a better man. I may have come a long way in the past ten years, yet I feel like my life is ultimately useless. I benefit no one but myself, and only I am to blame on that front.

My debts weigh heavily on my shoulders. I spend too much to actually invest in a vehicle; I spend too much to actually pay my debts. I make too little to do what I want to do. I have spent less than a day, in the last five years, vacationing. I think I'm absolutely fucked. I don't think I can fix myself.

So what do I do? Get counseling that I can't get to? Or continue dwelling on my problems that my father had asked me not to do in his farewell letter to me that I had lost?

Sometimes, like this, I feel like death is my only answer, only I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it myself. I don't like thinking about it because of the implication, but my mother is the biggest reason. My sisters may be able to move on, but my brother would likely be devastated, though I feel he's not long for this world either. That's why I *wish* for death. It's an excuse that can keep my family going.
I really do not believe my life is going to improve; It's only going to get worse, and it's my own damn fault.

I wish for my own death.
______________________________

After I finish posting this, I'm probably going to write in it again, telling how I'm a whore who expresses his emotions on the internet as a cry for attention. In a way, I don't think I'm wrong. I don't know who is going to read this, if anyone, but regardless of whether or not *you* believe any of this is of no concern to me. I know this is how I feel.

No, I'm not going to call a suicide hotline, even if the thought does weigh heavily in my heart. As of right now, I know I'm not going to kill myself. I'm too much of a bitch to actually carry out *anything*, even if it was initially a plan to make my future better like getting a car, or even further, a fucking license. Regardless of if I even *had* a plan of any sort, getting COVID and recovering took a long enough time to set me back even further than I had anticipated.

This is all a burden that I carry always, and have carried for longer than ten years. I bought myself this expensive personalized journal and received it two weeks so I could at least *attempt* to get better mentally, and I had bought it because I know that I'm still going to be financially fucked any way I look at it, but so far it's just me complaining about my roommates and recent symptoms.

This excerpt was among the first things I actually bought the journal for. A hope for my future? Perhaps, a step in the right direction? I doubt it.
As I wrote, I'm fucked."

depression,"My life is collapsing by the end of the year, as usual",I guess I’d just like to yeet myself now. It feels terrible being in a place where I was happy in about 1-2 months ago and now it’s completely different. I’m sad. I’m failing at everything I used to ace. I don’t know if I am digging a hole for myself right under where I am standing in life or not.
depression,My cat is missing,"My cat ran away from home about two days ago. She helped immensely with my depression and anxiety. I thought she was happy here and I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault. I feel like I just lost my best friend. She’s gone outside many times, but this is the only time she just left for good. I’ve spent hours walking outside looking for her. She’s not at shelters or anywhere. I’m trying to be positive and keep hope that she will come home, but it’s exhausting. Every time I go search and get excited thinking it’s her only for it to be another cat. Which others are great too, but I just want mine back. I’ve never had a pet runaway before and I just feel so sad"
depression,My friend wrote an article recently,"He sent me his writing to read, it was not even a great article. He's not great at language.

But this made me realize - he had motivation. I wanted to write since forever but can never make myself start. And it felt really strange to see a person who just... does something. I saw that it's impossible to be understood by non-depressed people, since I can't understand their healthy, motivated perspective.

I started thinking about other situations, where I saw people doing things they're interested in, just because they can and want to. It made me realize that I'm not ""lazy"", but there is something seriously wrong with my mind. It's a scary realization, but somehow comforting. For the first time I was able to accept that I'm not just weird, but actually sick."
depression,Venting,"Somethings wrong with me and this acids only making me realize everything about the true nature of my mental state. I am so drained of energy, and with no time to invest in the one thing I’d promised I’d put it towards, I don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel the urge telling me to keep living. Everything right now is painful and I’m not sure how to escape it. I don’t want to fight with anyone, I don’t want to have any chaotic energy or interactions. I just want that light in my life to find it’s way back to me. Or for me to find it?  I love Avery with my whole heart I can say that for sure but I’m just now realizing how much I’m holding back on her cause I’m so lost and on the verge of breaking down. Nothing excites or stimulates me, I’m a failure.  Even when trying to go to
school to pursue the thing I loved, I was not energized or fulfilled enough to pursue it properly, I just simply exist, there is so sound or motion in my life. I want to escape this repetitive and stuck body but at the same time I don’t try to, and I don’t have the drive, I have burnt out and I feel like death is the only remedy. Suicide if the only thought that seems logical."

depression,why is school keeping me alive,"The only thing keeping me alive is graduating uni, but at the same time uni is causing me so much stress. I cry after completing any assignment or after every meeting. What's the point of living if i'm not doing anything i enjoy and i dont have anything to look forward to after finishing school. I dont like my major and i dont think i could live a life doing anything with it as a job. Why am i making myself suffer when i have no passions or aspirations or anything i find joy in."
depression,I never NEVER do anything right,"And when I say this I truly mean it, there is always something I do wrong or can't do by myself.. Some stupid mistake I make that nobody else even thought of doing, misunderstanding things, forgetting them, not being able to keep up, not being independent, giving up before even trying, not knowing how to say no, being insecure, being bad at literally everything that isn't blindly staring at my phone and mindlessly scrolling for hours.
I have no brain power at all and I have never hated myself so much. I used to be smart (at least in school) and I thought that I would start getting smarter (life wise) but that just isn't happening. I'm in my second year of college and my course work is already a disaster. I missed my first exam because I didn't study at all during the weekend. I don't know my way around the city all that well, I am in a friend group but I don't talk to any of them outside of uni or when we decide to meet up because I don't feel like they would even want to talk to me. I would like to think that I am like this because of my mental health (I don't mean to self diagnose but I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with me tbh) but maybe I'm just dumb and I'm now being forced to face it instead of just hiking myself in my room and remaining in blissful ignorance.
I gave no hobbies that actually require skill, I don't know how to swim and everytime I need to use my brain I go into a state of confusion that makes me do the stupidest things. I don't if it's anxiety or what but it sucks.
I don't want to get up in the morning, I always do tho. I go to my online classes but I never pay attention (I'm in one rn actually), I need to organize myself but I don't know where to start, I need a lot of help but I'm ashamed to ask because it just forces me onece again to realize just how dumb I am.
I always tell my parents everything is fine but everything is not fine and all I want to do most of the time is quit this year of college and go work and make my own money. Get my driver's license and actually prove to myself that I'm not useless. But the truth is that it isn't that easy because I actually have people I consider friends here and breaking the news to them would be nothing short of awful. I don't see things getting better unless I make a radical change but I'm always putting it off.
I don't know where I'm going with this but if you read this far thank you truly."
depression,Life's depressing,"My school life was shit. Most people ignored me as I was anxious. My home life is shitty too. My parents doesn't ever let me out by myself. I have no siblings.

Btw, I'm in College now.(17)
Got into a good College but most of my classmates and even school teachers are not happy about it and they spread rumours that I cheated.(I didn't though)

Im sorry i just needed to rant but today my grandma called over the phone and we called on messenger and we had are camera on and it just breaks my heart because she can't recognize me any longer, I loved my grandma and everyone in my family but I already know the feeling of losing someone, I lost my grandpa years ago and I wasn't even close with my grandpa but I felt down for about a week and cried so hard, I just hate the thought of losing someone even If i just met you and we are connected somehow, ill still get so upset if I hear news about something bad happening to you. My grandma is old,she is in her late 80s and I overheard she threw up again, and she already has a stroke and now the thought of losing her while she can't remember me makes me hate my life more. That's a part of the reason why since the first year of highschool I wanted to die because I didn't want to lose anyone else, when I saw my grandpa die I thought to myself that I hope to never see anyone else die. Im really sorry I just wanted to vented so bad."
depression,Depressed and badly heartbroken,"I have recently came out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend. She used to abuse me emotionally psychologically and then finally physically. 

I found out she was escorting and dominating for money and took her back. I also found out she was sleeping with other men and I took her back from it all. I loved this girl so much. But when I look back on it I don’t think she ever loved me. I think she was dominating me and getting off on it. She displayed real narcissist behaviour such as gaslighting me. Building me up and tearing me down. Used to even call me her little lost puppy. Never used to show empathy. She used to regularly laugh at her ex boyfriends she claimed she “broke their hearts”. 

I couldn’t even tell my friends What was happening out of sheer embarrassment. 


I live in a gang area in the us. And come from a low income housing project. Once I was on the way home and saw a man killed while on the phone to her. There was nobody else on the road just me and this guy. We was both wearing “urban” style clothes. He turnt out to be an innocent man. This could have been me if I hadn’t gone a different way, I only went that way because my ex had called me and I wanted to talk to her. So I took a longer route. I used to smoke weed but it just had me thinking of me watching this guy die. It used to give me anxiety attacks. Uncontrollable shaking. She noticed that and used to play on it. Saying she gave me a place out the hood to come to. 

She used to always hit me and strike me and I used to restrain her. Until the last time. 
It ended with a big fight and I finally hit her back. 
Her last words she ever said to me before I hit her was “can’t you see I don’t respect you. You’re f***img me after you know I have had sex with other men”


She went to the police and filed false reports on me which broke my heart so badly. I was in jail dreaming that the charges would get dropped and she would tell the truth but she never did. I felt so betrayed because I stuck by her through everything. She used to cry in my arms while I rocked and kissed her to sleep. She was my first love. 

I am now facing legal battles against her vicious lies trying to defame my character. She always promised I couldn’t be happy if it wasn’t with her. And now she’s going through with her plans. 

I find it hard to eat regularly. 

I go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. Then sleep all day. 

The “hood” I live in regularly innocent people are killed by accident and it’s not advised to be out by yourself for no reason. But it’s weird I’m not scared of anything anymore just numb. 

I have thought about ending it all but I been through so much even before her. 
I can’t have been through all that to go out like that. 
That means she will win. 

I’m a really good hearted person and sometimes
I feel to become a heartless villain and never show anybody love again. But she would still win because she would have changed me forever. 

All this while she’s enjoying her life. Has a new boyfriend. And regularly cryptically taunts me through her social media accounts. 

Tldr; I’ve been broken by somebody who was my bestfriend. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so low in my life."
depression,Martyred by hands his own.,"This is my first time writing on reddit. I used to have a passion and a focus in my mind and I had a whole plan of what I wanna be in 5 years. This was back in 2015. I'm 22 years old now and shit couldnt have hit the fan harder than it has in these 5 years. And the worst part is it's all my own fault. I wont blame fate or life or anything  like that because I am the architect of my own undoing and I've dug myself deep enough into rock bottom that I cant climb out of it now. I want to live and thrive but there seems to be no hope. I hesitate to call myself a martyr but that's what comes to my mind when I think of the difference between who I am today and who I was 5 years ago. There seems to be no way out. And even if there was, my lazy and worthless ass would destroy that hope too. I sound disgusting. I am. And I wouldnt expect to not be berated here for what I've done with all my time and my means."
depression,rant,"am I a product of my environment? are my sexual tendencies caused by the constant slut shaming recurved from my parents since I was young or am I making up excuses? 

I remember vividly the time I did my makeup when I was about 10 years old, I was so proud and went to show my dad, in which he called me a whore. I ran away crying and later he came and apologised, saying he was upset and took it out on me. 

I don’t think I’ll ever forget that, and alongside the more subtle slut shaming by calling my outfits slutty or “whore-ish” and my mum constantly assuming whenever I go out I’m secretly hooking up with someone, I think I’ve finally lost all self respect I’ve ever had. 

At this point I don’t even care, I already know what they think of me and I’m not surprised, but it still hurts knowing your own parents look at you that way. 

These are the same people who vow to love me no matter what, and to never make me feel less than enough, yet they manage to make me feel the absolute opposite AND make it feel like it’s my own fault. 

Is it? I can’t tell. Maybe it is my fault, maybe I shouldn’t have kissed that one guy, maybe I did this all to myself. Is this a form of self destruction? I don’t know."
depression,Parent depressing me.,[removed]
depression,Am I depressed?,"I know self diagnosing is the worst, but I am too afraid to go to therapist and I tried to talk to my sister and mom about it. But my mom says ""just think of happy thoughts and you won't be sad anymore"" or ""Do you think a mother wants to hear their daughter being depressed?"". And my sister rarely replies to me or read my texts. 
In the past I was very suicidal because how my mom used to treat me. When we argued she would say that I'm trash, a piece of sh*** and she would hit me, sometimes threaten me with a knife.
She doesn't treat me like that anymore, but it left a scar on me.
Now I am attending college and live in a dorm so I don't get to talk to them face to face.
 The reason why I  believe I may have depression is because I feel numb, worthless, and a waste of space. But these feelings are hidden and I have always kept it hidden. I blocked these emotions for years and it started to come back to the surface.
I want to talk to someone about feeling depressed, my roomate at least or my Uncle (who I rarely talked to, but I know he knows what it feels like), but I have trust issues. I don't want them to report me, or tell my mom about this. Since I'm not going to take action, but I just want someone to talk to.

depression,Go into a fight with my soon to be ex best friend.,I don't really wanna get into the reasons why we got into a fight because I already posted about it. But I think we're not good for each other as friends because we've been getting into a lot of fights and to avoid a lot of fight I let a lot of things slide with her (she won't was the dishes for a few days after she's cooked) and I don't really do a lot of housework either. We don't really hang out and I can never seem to be on her level intellectually. When ever we fight I'm always the bad guy and maybe I am... I moved in with her because I thought we would be able to help each other out with negative self talk and obviously it hasn't worked. I feel like I'm getting worse and I'm passing that onto her but I also just want to never admit I'm wrong anymore even though I have to....

depression,My mom finally understood,"This last month has been the worst of my life. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist in September, but I still haven't gotten a diagnosis or started with medicines. A couple of days ago I attempted suicide, my mom doesn't know but my psychologists do, and they want me to go inpatient. I will know when on monday.                 
                
Recently my school has started online classes again, and I can't bring myself to focus. No matter how hard I try, I can't. I don't remember the last time I did my homework. I talked about this with my therapist and they told me it's okay (which made me feel a lot better, because I was blaming myself), and that it's better if, until I start feeling better, I stop trying to focus or do my homework or to do anything in general. I told this to my mom, and finally she said that it's okay. We cried together for like an hour, and decided that I will take a break from school. I feel kinda guilty, but I do feel better. Even though none of my friends checked up on me today that I missed 3/4 of my classes. But it's probably because they're used to me skipping school lol.

depression,Understand thy neighbour,"What happens when you no longer feel like doing anything anymore?  Laying in bed until the afternoon.. Binge eating or under eating. Gaining lots of weight or losing a tone of weight. Spending countless hours on the phone scrolling through media that means nothing to you. Losing confidence in one self, suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts.

Do only “weak beta fools” experience this as some of us like to say? As much as it is wise to not be a victim in life we do have to accept the fact that our environment can play a huge role in our mental state. You will find it difficult to thrive when you feel you have no control with your life, you cannot create when working a job that is unfulfilling. You will find it hard wear a smile on your face when those around you lack understanding of why you might behave in a certain way and you certainly will find it challenging to want to stay alive everyday since you feel nobody has interest in your wellbeing. “Uh but life is tough so sit down and shut up and make better choices!” Do not say such things to an individual you would suspect to be depressed. “Depression is just an excuse for laziness!” There is nothing I dislike more than those who speak like that, thinking that what worked for them is going to work for everyone else. Don’t be a fool, parents, friends and teachers make this mistake all the time when someone closes to them is having a difficult time with their mental state. 

If you know anyone in your household, work or friend group who you suspect might be going through this, avoid your pointless un-empathetic nagging with your “tough love” you might eventually actually drive them to suicide just in case you didn’t know.. “oh but it’s not my responsibility if someone kills themselves or not”. Well... Of course it isn’t and to be quite frank the whole world could blow up tomorrow and it will not make a difference to the rest of the universe but I will say this... Everyone is different, circumstances do affect someone’s choice makings in life and does affect the way someone is going to respond to adversity and those people who had any form of hardship no matter what the hierarchy of the pain was will be sensitive. “Oh but you can grow out of it”. Sure but not with those around them who mock and ridicule them. Make an effort to listen to your neighbour, love your neighbour. It’s hard time for all of us for sure. Don’t be a fool and make the effort to understand the other person before making irrational assumptions please. ❤️🙏🏽"
depression,If I were to disappear no one would notice/care,"Very lonely lately. I’m have a lot of social anxiety and it doesn’t help that I’ve struggled tremendously to meet friends both online and off. 

I recently have been thinking about how if I were to just disappear one day, no one would notice. (Aside from immediate family) There wouldn’t be anyone wondering about where I’ve been, no one checking in, nothing. If I were to vanish no one would notice, and I’d most likely never be thought of again"
depression,"What's the point of getting help, if I'll still never amount to anything","I've had chronic depression for something like 15 years now, over half my life, I've only ever gotten any medicine for about a year of it, and all they did was make me feel constantly nauseous. Never had any followup from the psychiatrist or my doctor regarding me stopping the meds.

So anyway yea, as the title says, recently I've been thinking about how, even if I do somehow miraculously get help get better, I don't see how it'll matter. I'll still be stuck in the same pit that I'm in, unable to get out, move on or make anything of my life. So what's the point?  *What's the point in expending time and energy on trying to get better, when it won't matter in the grand scheme of things.* Especially when I don't plan on sticking around much longer than a couple years anyway.

For a bit of clarification, I've been ""blessed"" by life with the sweet trifecta that is Chronic Depression, Anxiety and Autism. Just awesome really. So even if I did somehow get my depression under control, the other two are bad enough that they'd still prevent me from going outside my apartment more than I already do (about 2-3 times a month for groceries, only go out because I can't afford to get deliveries), get any sort of job, contribute to society in literally any way, or make *any* sort of meaningful connections with other people.     

It was hard enough getting them to prescribe any meds originally, because according to them ""Autism and Depression mimic each other quite a lot, so it's gonna be hard to tell which symptoms stem from what"". And with any sort of therapy help out the window (can't go outside my apartment, or talk to new people even on the phone/VOIP), I'm just not really sure how worth it it'll be for me to try and fight for getting meds that *might* help, or might make it worse (and cost me money I don't really have).

Anyway, not really sure how to end this post so.. yea."

depression,So lost.,I can’t remember the last time I was happy. It makes me sad just thinking that. I try so hard to make myself feel better or get myself in a better place but it feels like I’m running into a wall everyday. I’m so lost in life and I know things could be worse but it sucks when you try just to fail. Not only yourself but people around you. Just constantly letting people down is a terrible feeling. I’m never sure of how much more I can take feeling like this. It’s so tiring faking the smiles and laugh from day to day. All I want to do is give up but I know it’s not that way.
depression,I don’t want to grow up.,I’ve (18 F) been feeling very scared and down lately. I’m a senior in high school and I don’t even have my license yet and it makes me feel pathetic. I’ve been job searching and applying which makes me feel a little better and not so useless. But I’m scared to graduate and become an adult. I don’t wanna be an adult. I wanna be a child still. My friends have been talking about me behind my back and leaving me out when talking about things. I have one incredible friend that I can always count on which makes me happy. I have a boyfriend who I’ve been dating for almost a year and he’s not very nice to me but for some reason I still stay. He makes me feel like my feelings don’t matter and makes me problems look small. I feel bad for feeling bad though because I know that there’s people out there with bigger problems than me. I hate how this world is and it makes me not want to be alive anymore. I don’t wanna do this anymore.
depression,I spend most of my time in a fantasy world to cope with my unhappiness,"80% of the time I am on auto pilot and day dreaming. You can imagine to lack of concentration, mistakes and other mishaps I get myself into everyday just by not being present. I know it's not the answer to my problems but I would much rather be in my head than in real life. In there I am interesting, smart, quick witted, beautiful... The list goes on. In real life I am stupid, annoying, I don't have any friends, my social anxiety over whelms me and without stating the obvious I am so depressed that sometimes I don't even want to be here any more."
depression,Emotionally abusive family member,"My family member is mentally ill with depression but has also ruined a lot of my childhood so I have estranged myself from him. Problem is we live under the same roof. He keeps trying to force me to talk to him but I refuse to. For my own sanity, i despise all that he's done to my family so I cannot stand speaking to him, it's rly dor my own mental health. I agree that he himself struggles w mental illness but some of the things he's done and said are just so unsettling and really very horrible to be witnessed as a child. Recently he's started a new habit - he will try to talk to me, and if I don't he will exclaim loudly: you don't want to talk to me? Fine! I'll go take a xanax. Let's see how many xanax's ill take until i overdose because of you disrespecting me. Please tell me I am not wrong for despising him. I know this is the toxic side of his mental illness but I am a fucking human being I'm literally fucking 18 i am sick of this shit. I myself struggle from Severe anxiety and depression but i cant exteriorise it to my parents bc i dont want them to be sad. My parents are sympathetic to my plight but they have to placate that cunt because otherwise he might tip over the edge. God I just want someone to understand what a horrible position I am in right now. And he started this new thing of blaming taking pills on me not talking to him IN the middle of my fucking finals. The mental turmoil I am going through rn is so fucking huge you have no idea"
depression,I'm happy when people are around,"I'm happy when people are around but when I'm alone, I always overthink about the things i've done in the past. I can't came to a conclusion that I have depression or other mental disorders. I've always wanted to disappear for those mistakes and it scarred the people that are involved in my stupid past. But ending a page early will not be good for the people around me. I have to live throught this. But I can't"
depression,Masked,"Just typing this into the air, let it die. 

Nothing around me makes me feel joy. I just... sit here, faking it, hoping the feeling will come back. Years go by, and it just all feels so empty. I have no desire to live. No desire to die. Quite frankly, there aren't many desires left at all. I'm just, so bored of existing. So tired of being. 

The drugs dont work. The counseling doesn't work. Gratefulness practices didnt help. Meditation didnt help. It's been 17 years since the first time I genuinely wanted to stop existing, and the feeling never went away. Almost two decades of counseling, learning, and attempting to feel happy."
depression,Am I okay?,"It's insanity when someone asks if I'm okay. My mom did 2 days ago. And what if I am okay? For this moment. Then what? We're all here just slowly sliding back into the hole we are trying to escape. Sure, I'm okay for a moment just like you, clinging to the side of this mountain that we're both slipping down. Sure. We're both okay. We're okay. But that doesn't change the fact that we're both heading toward this hole. We're not going to get away from that. That's where we're going, so what's the point of climbing any further? Does ""okay"" mean I'm still climbing? Or that I've stopped to take a breather. Am I okay if I'm taking a breather? Or what if I decided to let go and climb down to that hole. Can I be okay then?

We aren't doing anything important here. We crawled out of that hole for what? What are we going to do here that is so important and vital? I can't think of one thing that, when I examine it, is really worth it all. I think the hole sounds better."

depression,My apartment complex is pissing me off but I can’t leave,"Our apartment complex is requiring 4 months rent to break the lease even though they raised our rent and fees in the middle of our lease. Our lawyer told us that unfortunately there’s nothing we can do besides paying them the termination fee. The funds will cover the lease termination fee. 

Like many families, we were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. I lost my job and my husband has been working from home since the lockdown. We didn’t qualify for the stimulus check, and the IRS has yet to give us our tax refund. 

Before the pandemic, we were looking for our first house to move into after getting married. However, our dog and I were suffering non-COVID related medical conditions and we lost most of our savings to medical bills. Unfortunately, that meant that we had to give up on looking for a house, and we had to renew our lease to avoid being homeless. 

Recently, we found a house that we could afford and ready to move in soon. However, our apartment doesn’t have a “home-buying” clause allowing us to break for free. We don’t want to lose the house due to the greed of our apartment management. They’ve taken advantage of us for far too long and we want to get out."

I have no support. There are no people IRL that I am close to. NO ONE. My family feels like coworkers. If I ask my mother for help emotionally, she just goes religious. This is completely hand waving.

depression,"TRIGGER WARNING. I was hospitalized for a psych eval last night for the first time last night, some venting and my general thoughts:","I’ve been trying to deal with depression for many years now. While that goes on, life situations have stacked up on top of each other, smothering me, and I haven’t had a chance to catch up or recover. I recently found out a few weeks ago that my mom has cancer, and ever since that diagnosis was brought to light, my mental health took a nose dive. I’ve learned how to manage it very well on my own, until something drastic happens. For example, my boyfriend and I have gotten in a couple bad fights in the past couple weeks and I had PTSD flashbacks from a prior abusive situation I was in. Last night was one of those 3 times. We were both triggered and already under stress so we both blew up. Someone must have heard us arguing because he was yelling extremely loud to me, and called the police. I was out in my car crying when they pulled up. That only worsened my PTSD because these things happened in my previous abusive situation. Long story short, I had admitted to the police that I want to die. I can’t handle the pain anymore and if I was left to go be on my own I certainly wouldn’t be safe. They had me admitted to the hospital for a mandatory psychiatric evaluation and speak to a crisis team. That was my first time ever experiencing something like that for myself. I was one room over from where my dad was when he was in the same situation. 
&gt;
Everyone was so nice, attentive and clearly cared very much for me - a stranger - and my safety. They were very adamant about trying to get me to stay in the psychiatric ward, but I just can’t handle that right now. They let me go home. I know it’s a necessary step I should take and I have been going back and forth with the idea for months now.. I just don’t feel ready. I’m scared. 
&gt;
I woke up today wanting nothing more than to be dead. I feel like I’m just broken and too sensitive and not meant for this world. I just want to be laid to rest. No more pain, no more loss. That’s what life is full of and lately the positives have been thinning out and I’m running out of reasons to stay. The only reason I’m here is for everyone who cares. I would never want to hurt them, but I purposely put myself in situations where I could potentially die and I would be okay with it. 
&gt;
I have a call with a clinician any minute now, and after that, I have another call with the local abuse counseling that I’ve been working with for months now. 
&gt;
I’ve been trying so hard but the more I try, the more I fail. The more pain I am in. I can’t do this anymore. I’ve tried saving myself but I can’t. I just wish I could disappear without hurting a single person at all. I just want rest."
depression,Just don’t care.,"Have any of you gotten to the point that nothing really matters anymore? I want things to matter but I almost feel dead inside. Constant depression and not wanting to get out of bed, not eating, making bad choices, yet I really don’t care. It almost feels like a safe place to be for me.

I lost the person I loved, I had my whole life planned with her and it didn’t work out and she wants nothing to do with me and quite frankly I felt like it was my last shot. Add onto that various other problems and I honestly don’t see a way out of it all. Everything I try to accomplish ends up failing and I always end up right back where I was before. My trust for people is gone now and I feel like all of the good in me has been ripped out. There is no more bright light in me, only despair and darkness. How does one get over this? Is it possible? I feel like my time is out."
depression,Feeling like I deserve this,How are you supposed to stop yourself from feeling like you deserve everything bad that happens? I hate myself and feel like it's only appropriate that every bad thing that happens should happen. I don't deserve happiness. I don't deserve love. I deserve to be miserable. I know tons of reasons why I shouldn't be allowed to be happy. How do you stop? I just want it to stop...
depression,Ugh I fucked up...again," I like a girl at a group home and she knows and a staff member Came back from the hospital and she told her story  About what happened but she did it she’s using it against me but she can’t really do that Because she kisses me and kept my legs open and touched me 

She laughed when my back arched and I made a noise because I was really turned on She touched me a lot Asked me to fuck her I said I wasn’t ready and she said ok I’m sensitive to touch and get turned on really easily and she knows this She does it any ways holding me down, running my back, grabbing in between my legs, kissing me, and more We were wrestling and she turned me on a lotttt I kept arching my back and making noises. That would be my side of the story I never touched her sexually so she would get in the most trouble

When she found out I told the staff member and she made me tear out all my notebook pages out because it held all the stuff that goes on. I let her read it tho. I dont know why I did. She said if I didnt tear the pages out she would beat my ass  She called me into her room later and was like ""What did I tell you would happen if you told them that?"" And I was like ""You would beat my ass"" and she was like ""Right. But I wont put my hands on you because its not worth it"""

I mean, everyone just wants to be right all the time and go back and forth instead of getting over themselves and admitting that something needs to change. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong or who started what. We all agree that *something* is wrong but no one wants to fix it bc for some reason fixing it means admitting defeat.

I hate that I can't even enjoy a simple positive video online without someone reminding me that the world will never accept me for who I am due to things that I have no control over. Getting blamed for things that I have nothing to do with just bc of the way I was born. 

I didn't ask to be here. None of us did. Why make existence harder than it has to be just because of useless hate perpetuated by pride? 

Everyone always says, ""There's nothing you can do about it."" or ""That's just the way it is."" While that might be true, it's still a problematic mindset. I know we can't get rid of hate completely but, just being a bystander to it and accepting it and doing nothing makes you just as bad as the people doing it. No matter what the situation.

It doesn't even make me mad anymore. It just makes me wanna cry...

Edit: Before the hate rolls in for me being an ""entitled white-privileged [insert insult]"", I'm a black queer female who empathizes with all human beings. Not that that should even matter."
depression,Hablar sobre el suicidio," El suicidio es y expresa tantas cosas como ideas sobre los límites del sufrimiento hay. Puede ser la consumación de un llamado de atención aletargado. Puede ser la única vía libre ante la opresión del malestar que parece no cesar. Puede ser un castigo, para uno y para otros. Puede ser la álgida expresión de un grito interior apabullado, silenciado, jamás oído. Puede ser… puede ser… Pero siempre es: una decisión muy íntima, que suena obvio pero en verdad no lo es. La libertad sobre nuestra vida parece supeditada a lo que otros le confieren y sobre cómo lidiar con lo mortífero que día a día acusa. “Qué egoísta es matarse, no piensan en el resto”, “qué cobarde es el suicida, sólo toman la salida fácil” “¿por qué no hablan o piden ayuda eh?”

El juicio moral está siempre presente, antes y después. No es tu vida y tu existencia, es “nuestra” vida que debes saber vivir aunque no la soportes, tenés que ser normal y productivo aunque pidas ayuda o no sepas genuinamente cómo simplemente sobrevivir a tu mente. Sea como sea, existe una gran incomprensión, un fuerte estigma y tabú alrededor del suicidio, y por extensión, de las enfermedades psiquiátricas. Los “locos” son los otros. Los medicados. Los débiles que se atreven a caer. Los que lloran. Los histéricos. Los que sólo quieren llamar la atención. El suicidio se transforma en el corolario de la debilidad y cobardía humana. Y en el medio hay una innumerable cantidad de personas que sufren, hora a hora. Incluso en el mayor de los silencios, camuflados de superación, estoicismo y alta eficiencia, porque sorpresa, se puede ser normal en la peor de las ruinas interiores. Podés trabajar, estudiar, reír, “vivir” con un trasfondo de angustia ingobernable. 

Por supuesto, esto no es un elogio del suicidio, sencillamente es una humilde visión de alguien que ha tanteado lo mortífero muchas veces, tantas veces que más de una pensás que realmente es parte de tu propia identidad. Pero algo que he aprendido, día a día desde que comencé mi tratamiento hace casi dos años: somos personas, no diagnósticos."

It feels like no one cares and no one is around to support you. You’re alone in this chaotic world and feel hopeless. 

You get that unsettling feeling mid day , midnight , even when you first wake up...in general you just feel overwhelmed. 

I just wanted to stop you from scrolling by to say that you are cared for and valued , you have worth and are never alone.

Things won’t stay this way ... that pain will heal. You will be stronger. 

Love yourself. Be your best friend not your worst enemy. 

I wish everyone a positive week and remember , all we can do is try! 

Love you all .. take care ❤️"
depression,"I'm at the point now where when people ask me what's going on, I tell the complete unfiltered truth.","I'm exhausted. I just stopped talking to everyone. I don't even have the patience to lie anymore. In the very rare instances when people ask me how I am, I just say I'm miserable and I want to die. I'm not even joking or trying to be edgy about it. 

""No! Don't say that!""

Why not? I am miserable. I want to die. You want me to lie about it? You want me to say I'm okay? I'm not okay. Why should I tell you any different? Don't want to hear it? Don't ask. 

I feel like I'm preparing for the end. I think that I'm being very flippant about my feelings because I just care anymore. I know that this is never going to end. I know that I just have to take this all into my own hands. I know that I'm running out of time. 

""But you have so much to live for?""

Like what? Why does everyone keep lying to me about this? I have a lot to live for? Life is so wonderful? Everything will be okay? How? How on Earth is everything going to be okay? Nothing has been okay for 32 fucking years. What do I have to live for? Why don't you just tell me what it is that I have to live for? If I were hungry would you tell me about food, or would you give me something to eat? I don't need to hear that it will get better, I need it to get better. 

Sometimes I envision my anger and depression as a fire raging in my chest. I daydream that one day that fire will burst out of me and devour everything. I can see the entire world engulfed in my hatred."

depression,"My parents believe depression meds and therapy is bad for you and ""for the weak"".","Ok, so I'm a 14F and I have undiagnosed depression. It has negatively affected me a lot recently because I have had to do online school where you work at your own pace and I have bad procrastination habits and I get distracted easily. Not to mention the motivation issues I have because of depression. Also the constant worry that my parents will contract the coronavirus and get very sick and/or die because the US is handling the pandemic horribly.

So about my parents... They are very religious and they believe that mental health isn't that serious of an issue. I love my parents but I am struggling everyday to the point where it affects the rest of my family (with my depression I am having problems with my sleep schedule and the amount of sleep my body craves) as well as my grades (I have gotten all A's up to this point).

My parents seem to only want to argue with me why they are right instead of actually helping me with my mental health. They have sat me down and tried to have a conversation with me about my mental health but when I share my struggles with them (which is sometimes difficult because I have a hard time explaining some things in a way that makes sense) they tell me to ""just do __, it's not that hard"" (for example, I say that I have trouble motivating myself to do things like schoolwork and they say something like ""oh, well I have to do work at my job, if I can do it you can too."" And ""motivation comes from inside you, you're just telling yourself that you aren't motivated because you want an excuse not to do it.""

(TW?) My parents also like to use mention of depression medications and therapy as a way to mock me (for example, I tell them that I am having a hard time coping with my mental health issues and they say things like ""oh, so what do you want me to do about it? Do you want drugs?"" As if depression medications aren't effective and the only reason I am bring up my depression is because I want to get addicted to drugs or something. They also strongly imply that wanting/taking depression meds is weak because other people can ""just deal with it and get back to life as normal""). Another thing that really bothers me about that is the fact that they bring it up randomly when I'm just going about my day. Like I would just be watching a movie or something with the rest of my family and the movie would mention something about mental health medications and my parents would address me in some way. Like, I'm already struggling enough with depression, I don't need everyone to point out that they think virtually the only thing that could help me is bad, especially if I was having a good time before.

They do kind of have a reason to think that depression medication is bad, though. I know a lot of my family members from my mom's side had a history of taking depression medications and seeming to lose some of their emotion. For me, though, I've had worse depressive episodes where I felt like I had no emotion, so would the medicine have any different effect? I also think that it would be more healthy in the long run to cure my depression than to have worse symptoms in the future. I mean, given the circumstances, I could be having worse effects because of the pandemic and once the pandemic is over my depression could not be as bad as it is now and I wouldn't need as much (if any) medicine anymore.

So I guess for now I'll just have to find some healing crystals that will magically take my depression away.  Either that or I will have worsening depression throughout my life as it gets more difficult to function every day until eventually I overwhelm myself to the point of not existing. If only it were that easy."
depression,Need some magic,"If I had the opportunity to have everything done for me but have to stay inside a small apartment majority of the time I’d take it. I don’t have much of a drive to do anything else besides isolate myself once I’m finished with responsibilities. I’m not suicidal but I’m giving up, I’m neglecting everything. I hardly care, I just want a roof over my head. I won’t if I keep this up..."
depression,At this point idk what this page is I just find myself coming back during bad times,"I am actually so close to just doing it, at this point I don’t even know who I am or what I want in life , I have no personality and I’m always negative , my confidence is all fake and nothing means anything anymore , my passions have died out and I have nothing I want in life , I thought I had everything needed to get better, I thought Being successful in my career would make me happy but it hasn’t , I’m not happy and seeing that I have a good life and not feeling any of the joy makes me feel worse for being ungrateful,  “no reason” to be depressed just makes me more upset to why I feel this way"
depression,I think I became dumb,"I’m 21 and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I can’t study, think critically or focus and I start losing all motivation to even try to. I have very strong issues with my concentration and memory at the moment.

I’m inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don’t have opinions on certain topics. I can‘t find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‘t follow conversations because I just can‘t focus.

For the same reason I just can‘t focus in uni online classes. I‘m present all time but I don‘t remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‘t remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on.

I feel like I can’t even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don’t know ANYTHING. It’s like I forgot everything I’ve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. This really fucks with my self worth and self esteem. I mean being socially anxious (not talkative, not open, asocial), depressive (low mood/anhedonic) and then dumb, too?

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts, knowledge or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‘t learn new things anymore. I read things I’m interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I‘m not sure if I‘m able to complete my last two semesters of my psychology bachelor being like this. Even if I would complete it, I don‘t know in which job someone like me, a young man with depression, social anxiety and now also cognitive deficits, could work and get his job well done. Then how would I ever be able to socialize when now even my cognition lets me down. How would soneone like me ever be happy and confident or create real friendships/romantic relationships? These thoughts worsen my depression but it‘s so realistic when I stay like this, disabled.

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others..."

From the outside my life looks pretty good, but I dread waking up every day. I’m up right now because if I stay awake longer, tomorrow’s shit show comes later. I’ve got so much on my plate, I owe everybody money, my job is killing me, I really don’t know how much more of this constant battle I can take.

If you have a friend who’s always happy, someone who appears to have no fucks to give, the one who helps everyone else out, give them a shout every now and then just to see how they’re doing, it means more than you know."
depression,Came home from work last night to find my roommate/ex-girlfriend/best friends body.,"Dont know the official cause of it, I feel like it was a diabetic seizure from drinking too much and not maintaining their levels, the way I was questioned by the police made it sound like a suicide.

I don’t want to be alive. I don’t want to have to work everyday for the rest of my miserable life. I don’t want to have kids or meet anyone. I just want to be alone but at the same time not be so lonely. I just want to sleep. The only thing I really like is sleep. I wish I could just sleep forever.

depression,"Once again, nothing feels okay",I want to vanish into thin air.
depression,struggling with codependency,"I've had depression for a long time now and I recently noticed my codependency has been one of the reasons why I am depressed. When I used to date my ex I was heavily codependent. My bad days would form whenever I knew I wasn't able to see him, or when he told me he was going to hangout with his friends, or when I felt like I wasn't getting enough attention. I knew that this was toxic for our relationship but I don't think he ever realized it. 

Fast forward to now, I am talking to another guy and I noticed I've become codependent with him as well. Except this time it's worse. The guy I am talking to struggles with depression as well, and whenever he was having a bad day, I would end up having a bad day too. When he's sad he tends to shut off his phone. So I would then spend the entire day being sad and worrying about him and worrying if I'm good enough for him. This is damaging to me since whenever I'm sad, I end up losing all productivity and motivation. Hence why my room gets cluttered all the time and I have lots of missing assignments. Recently he told me that he wanted to stop facetiming and going to sleep every night like we usually do and that broke me. I tried to keep a smile and told him that it's okay and that I respect his decision. However I know every night from now on will be like hell for me. I feel like I should end things with this guy but I like him way too much and I'm not sure if it's just my self destruction convincing me to do so. Plus, I heavily struggle with communication. I never ever say what's on my mind."
depression,I'm holding my girlfriend hostage,"My very existence is a burden to her. She constantly says we don't belong together. She says she isnt confident in me. She says she doesnt trust me. She wants to break up but every time I fight and beg for her to stay because I love her and want her to be happy. She isn't excited by me anymore, not happy to see me, doesn't ask how I'm doing. Whenever I compliment her and tell her how much I appreciate her she just ignores me. I'm just the clutter of trash she doesn't feel like throwing out. I'm nothing to the woman I love. I'm barely even a person anymore. I'd be doing her a favor with offing myself. I'll always be by her side as long as she allows me to because I love her so much but I just wish I felt like she cared a bit more."
depression,What moments of your life did you feel truly happy?,"When I went with my Dad to my Grandparent's house for Christmas  in Atlanta and played with my cousins when we were young. It was such an incredible feeling, they say heroin feels like that. First time I feel in love was also like that but it didn't last more than a few weeks."
depression,Depression and the ability to act compassionate,"Do  you also feel less capable of being compassionate, especially on bad days? Do you feel more rigid with your boundaries and less understanding for others? Especially in the work enviroment, do you stay in the job  definition or do you go for extra mile?

I  find myself more unwilling to bend the rules or to use my spare time for the patients who have arrived just at the end of clinic hours, travelled form a different city, can't get away from work to come to the hospital or have trouble getting an appointment from hospital system. Increasingly, the reasons they give sound more like excuses. I still maintain my professionalism and act according to good medical practice but don't take on other people's job or use my own time to give extra care.

Meanwhile I’m struggling with self harm (which they know about), depression, anxiety and hearing voices, hasn’t ever been asked if I’m ok, or gotten a hug.

I feel like my mental health has reached it's lowest point right now. I've noticed that recently

* Zoning out during group outings
* Barely contribute to conversations and not talking
* Feeling depressed while with friends
* Bottling up my emotions all the time and never told my feelings to anyone
* Relying on alcohol to escape my emotions and reality
* Self-confidence is at an all time low
* Disengaged in daily activities/hobbies - not interested
* Can't even watch netflix or youtube without dozing off about my future
* I've just been listening to music and daydreaming for hours

depression,I'm constantly being used as a therapist,"For some reason, I always attract the people who do nothing but complain, which is beginning to drain the LIFE out of me. I'm recovering from depression, so I guess I sympathise with everyone, but at this point no one asks me how I'm even doing, and my friends only talk to me when something's wrong. I wouldn't mind giving advice or anything but they suffer from mental illnesses and idk how to cure them. Bear in mind I'm 15 and I shouldn't have to carry everyone's trauma, especially that I want to focus on school but I literally would feel so bad to ignore my friends when they want to complain, so I'm constantly spending hours on my phone writing paragraphs trying to make them feel better which really does nothing.

I've previously cut off friends in the past and explained to them how used and drained I felt, and they made me feel like I'm the most evil person for doing it so I don't wanna hurt another person again.

Advice please? sorry this isn't related"

You can skip a few phases but the final one is the most important one. I am just introducing the phases, you can skip them, later I will let you know how these phases are affecting me now mentally. I have put border around the phases so that you can skip them. 

————————————————————————————
THE BEGINNING:
The biggest concern in my life is my worry of my FUTURE. 
This first started when I was 14 and in high school (9th Grade). I wasn't a great student but I was always on the average side. Even though I was average, I was sincere and did all my work, tasks and other things properly. I was only average on the marks side. I did not score well. I was getting worried and marks were dropping every time. There were some subjects i like and I scored well in them but in some I was average and I failed in Mathematics (I passed in retest/compartment).


NEXT YEAR:
Then came Grade 10th of High school, I was doing great, I improved and I wanted to improve even more. I started scoring more, I started scoring above Average at that time. Everything was fine and smooth in Grade 10. It was great. Until the finals came. I did fairly well and I scored average. I score 72%. But this wasn't enough, I wanted to take Mathematics&amp;Physics as I wanted (even now this is my dream) to do do engineering. I am passionate about cars and I can make good designs and I have good knowledge about them on the technical side, I wanted to do automobile engineering. But the cutoff for this stream was 75%.
I was in top school of the city, they denied me because of 3%. My father was trying so hard to get my admission. The school told us to wait till August. We waited and the new session already begun. The admission was denied. I could have got the admission, if I tried hard enough myself. I could've persuaded the school by showing my capabilities, skills and my improvement. But I did not. This thing still eats me to this day. There is no night that I don't think about this phase. Every goddamn night. 


BIG CHANGE:
I took admission in some school in my city, not the best but an average school. I took mathematics. Mostly people who take the Science Streams take admissions in dummy schools. This was a dummy school (this means that attendance doesn't matter, children prepare for the big exam, the entrance exam. World's toughest exam, you can research about this). 
When I joined half of the year was gone because of me trying to get admission. 
When I joined, it was a shocking experience for me, my country's incompetent education system doesn't handle transitions well from Grade 10 to Grade 11. The syllabus was different and hard. It was complex. I mean it change so much, my progress was gone and I went below average and close to failing. Physics was the toughest for me. I failed in Mathematics and Physics in Grade 11 but somehow I managed to pass, in retest. 


FINAL PHASE OF HIGH SCHOOL AND THE PHASE OF PAIN:
Then came the final year of High school, grade 12. I had to do well to get admission in a good college. I tried understanding and keeping up with everything that I missed or that was going on in my syllabus. I joined coaching to help me understand. I understood most of the things, but there were some things left that would harm me later. But I was out of time. The whole year went by so fast, so quickly. I was frustrated by the end of it. My life became depressing. I did not do anything. My routine was HOME&gt;SCHOOL&gt;COACHING. That's it, thay was my routine from oast 2 years. I did not enjoy or do anything. 
Then by the end of the year Final exams came. I scored average in entrance exam. Then came the final exams. Same case, physics was tough for everyone, an I was sure I was about to fail. 

——————————————————————————————


Now I will tell you how these things have affected me in the past 8 months during lockdown and Covid—19

As soon as my exams finished, within two weeks, the government imposed a lockdown in the country. Millions became homeless, people were struggling financially. This made me sad, only if i could do anything. This was not the proper way to impose a lockdown. Anyways, coming to the point, I felt relieved at the starting of Lockdown, I felt like it was a much needed break for me. 
Maybe I was happy that the result will be delayed or stuff or maybe I was happy and grateful for this break in life. I don't know. I did everything I wanted or I wanted to try, I did everything freely. I had no tension. 


But some days later, a feeling came rushing down in me. I became scared and anxious. I started to worry about my future. I started to worry about failure and disappointment. 
Few months later, the result date was announced, I was certain that I was going to fail, I started figuring out all the possibilities. I decided to end my life if I failed. As i couldn't bear the fact that I will disappoint my parents and I can't let them feel embarrassed. I started counting the days till the result. I started writing, doing everything i could. I started preparing and researching ways to die a peaceful death. 
I started to spend the time I had left with quality. This quality time was spent with my family. There was no night that I didn't cry.

Then came the result, somehow i managed to pass, but it was still a failure in my eyes. My parents were kind of happy but I could feel thay they are disappointed. I was disappointed in myself and my abilities. I started questioning my decisions. I was so close to death. I thought the pain will go away but clearly it did not, it became worse. Even though I managed to pass, but the marks were still average and I can't get into a good top level college to achieve my dream and the career path i am passionate about.

My life has become hell. I am the problem. I have got everything anyone could desire. I have got great height (6'3""),good body built, opportunities, facilities.
The one thing I have always sought is Perfection, i wanted perfection in everything. I hate failure and I always take it bad on me if I fail or disappoint anyone myself. I feel like an utter failure and disappointment to ny parents. I feel like a liability. I don't want to be a burden on them. We are a middle class family and they have done so much for me and spent so much on my education. Yet here I am. Honestly, i am in the most confusing phase of my life. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I should live and sometimes I only see death. Honestly, i feek like death is the better option. Instead of being a failure and disappointment to my parents I should just go. My siblings are doing good. I ahve always wanted the best for everyone. And i want the best for them also. Maybe seeking too much perfection is bad after all. I do not blame anyone but myself. I am a bad son.

Don't worry I won't die, I hope i find my path and i do well. No more mistakes this time. I hope i get my way. Because u just don't know what the hell is happening in my life. And if death comes, i hope so, it should be natural.

Farewell."
depression,Have anyone here been so depressed that they were nauseous?,"I feel this today and it hate it.

Also contacted my therapist but she hasn't answered me for 3 days."
depression,Antidepressants?,"Hey, so I feel it’s important to mention that I am not diagnosed with depression, however I deeply relate to all of its symptoms. I started struggling with low moods towards the end of high school, I would go a few days laying in bed with no interest in any of the things I used to have interest in, basically no energy. But after about maybe 3 days to a week of that, I would get a random burst of energy. I would get so much done all within a day usually like, deep cleaning my home, finishing hw, starting projects, taking a shower, etc. Being a functioning human being lol... Well now it’s gotten a lot worse, I don’t even get those bursts of energy anymore. It’s extreme lows every single day. And it’s been that way ever since my dad passed away last year in September. I know his passing is the main reason I’m like this now, but I can’t get out of this funk. I don’t have any motivation at all, I don’t have any energy. And I don’t want to be like this anymore. I know there is talk therapy, but I don’t feel like that will be of any help for me personally. And I honestly believe depression is what I am struggling with and what I have struggled with in the past. So I want to look into getting on antidepressants maybe, ofc after seeing a professional and if that’s even what I have. But how would I go about that? And if you don’t mind me asking, if anyone in this group is on or has taken antidepressants. Did they help you? How did they make you feel?"
depression,I just cant anymore,"For ten years i kept myself strong, for myself and for everyone, in a relationship that sucked my life from me, i don’t recognize myself, i don’t have a will to live anymore, there’s no point.

I feel stuck and i’m tired."
depression,Just want to escape from everything and everyone,"I'm a 31 years old guy with a decent software job. I've not been in a relationship since last 6 years and it was a pretty bas breakup. I haven't still come out of it mentally. I cut contact with literally all my friends and was left with no one. 

All I want is to settle down with a girl and live peacefully. But apparently it's not so easy. I have no one to share my feelings. I've got no friends (thanks to the breakup). My family doesn't understand and I'm fucking annoyed all the time. I have no good reason to live. I just want to sleep peacefully and never wake up. Every fucking day is a hell for me. 

I'm not sure how long I can hold it."
depression,I can feel myself getting really low again,"I just wanna rant, this may make me feel less alone than writing stuff down.
The downwards spiral started at the beginning of last month when my ex of four years (first two years perfect, last two on and off) broke up with me. I started drinking, heavily. I went on a bender for eight days, drinking nothing but gin. I did learn a lot on the bender to be honest, I got closer to a lot of people in my life, I felt like I understood myself a lot more.
My ex got a new girlfriend a week later. It was a girl he was speaking to while we were on a break. She’s really ugly so it doesn’t make me feel as bad but it still hurts that he probably never liked me while we were together. He’d have been happy with any girl.
And I just feel so lost. I feel confused. About my sexuality. And I don’t know where to begin with that nor do I really wanna think about it. But when I don’t think about it, intrusive thought come. Dreams come telling me I’m actually gay. And I don’t know what I am honestly. I’m probably just bi but I’ve just been trying to conceal that part of myself for a long time for various reasons, mainly being that I don’t feel safe or comfortable to be anything other than straight due to past experiences. I don’t wanna live a lie but I don’t wanna live the truth. I don’t know what I wanna do. I just wanna be happy.
I’ve been having major issues with the way I look. They’ve always been there, just recently it’s been overly magnified to me. I know why I have these issues, and whenever I look at my body in the mirror I feel physically sick and just want to cry. I just want to put on weight, I feel like I have the body of a child and it makes me pretty suicidal honestly especially knowing that I can try my best to eat as much food as I can but nothing ever changes. I’m never gonna be anything other than skinny and I’m fucking sick of looking the way I do. 
My course is stressing me out, having to do more work than previous years this year and with my focus being so bad it takes up so much of my time. Making me feel more shitty.
I’ve started cutting everyone off. After my breakup I got so close to everyone in my life again since my ex didn’t like me having friends. I even started to develop new friendships. But I’ve been ignoring everyone for days because my mental health is too poor and I know that these people will understand if they’re the right people but I just feel so shitty for letting people down. 
I just feel like I’m here sometimes. Like I’m invisible to everyone else if that makes sense. Like I’d be in a room and it’d be like I’m watching it from a tv show and I’m not in the room... I just feel like I don’t exist sometimes and that can make it harder to socialize. I think this is due to depression, anxiety and being so confused about my sexuality that it fucks with my mind and makes me wonder who I am on a daily basis. 
I really don’t know how much longer I can cope with feeling so confused. But also all of my issues, especially around my appearance. I feel like I will never be able to be naked in front of a mirror, let alone around another person and it scares me. I don’t wanna be so insecure about the way I look. I love who I am and my personality I wish my body aligned with that. 
I’ve been getting suicidal thoughts. They’re intrusive. I do love life, I love being alive, I know that sometimes I just go through shit but it isn’t life that’s the issue. But I’m afraid one day I’ll get drunk or just dissociate really hard and end up getting the balls to fucking kill myself. I don’t wanna go out like that. But I’m afraid."

I wanted to find a place where I can openly communicate my feelings with real people and make them understand what I am feeling and what I go through. I sought out for medical help and trying out antidepressants. Going for therapies I cannot consider it because I am a high functioning depressive person and worry that I may expose my vulnerability to this society which demands me to be the provider of help rather than a seeker. Everyone looks up to me for things because they think I will be able to help them but the reality is that I am feeling more and more depressed about my life. Nothing excites me. I, out of fear, try working hard to achieve things. Eventually, I do manage to overachieve things but it keeps on deteriorating my mental health. I have lost touch with the world, people, family, friends in this journey of trying to achieve something, becoming someone. I don't want to live like this. All this obsession to achieve something and become someone comes from a deep inferior complex that I am not good enough. I have been struggling with that for so many years and I just cannot seem to overcome this feeling. It is affecting my day to day life and I cannot extract happiness out of this life. Please tell me there are people out there who feel the same way. Who understands what I am going through."
depression,Free depressos for everyone,"TW: mention of human wastes, blood, hospitals and serious illness. It's just generally questionable content. 

TL;DR: I was denied a surgery that would have drastically improved my quality of life (it got delayed but I don't know for how long I'll have to wait again) as I am physically disabled to some extend because I had a heavy allergic reaction. While recovering from the reaction, I was put with a heavily mentally and physically impaired man in one room due to space reasons who gave me one hell of a time because he wasn't able to control any body opening of his and constantly talked to me even when I told him to shut up (politely) because he has dementia too. His presence triggered me too because he's an alcoholic and this is how I lost my grandfather who I dearly loved. I was at the edge of two panic attacks, had to witness several shit explosions, and I just wanna lay down and cry. 


Hello hello hello, it's ya boi--
Okay joke aside I (23m) am fucking miserable. A surgery that would have heavily increased my quality of life was blown off for good because of an allergy I didn't know I have which caused me to have to stay in hospital for days right before the surgery would've happened. And since last night, there is an old man (80+) staying in my room too. For the sake of staying anonymous, I'll just call him the yellow man. Because, well. His skin and the part of the eyes that was supposed to be white were yellow. He had problems with his liver because he's an alcoholic, which is a trigger point to me because my grandfather died because of that and he was the only one in the family that I actually liked. 

Before I proceed I'd like to put a disclaimer here that I don't judge him for whatever he has, but I am mentally in a spot where I am at the edge of a panic attack for hours and writing keeps me busy so I prefer to let it all out here rather than breaking down and causing a havoc. 

So... Where to start. 
Yesterday afternoon he was brought in my hospital room because the room he originally stayed in turned out to be a covid Hotspot, but all tests for him were negative. Yet, he needed a new room, and mine was the only one with a free bed of course. So yeah, let's match up the immobile, sick-to-death dude with the young man that gets panic attacks on a regular base and has social anxiety. Good deal. Quick delivery. Would order again. 

Anyway! Not only that, but every time he breathes it sounds like he is gurgling listerine. And that listerine is on fire. And that fire is on fire too. And it's _loud_. Its so loud that I actually recorded a bit of his normal breathing from 4m/12ft away and it sounded like I stood right next to a pig with asthma getting water in its lungs pumped. 
And what would a man that breathes like a chainsaw do best? Talk! With whom? Me of course! And because he has dementia he doesn't understand anything subtle. He kept insisting he saw me in a town I've never been in and that my name is Flavio and Fabian at the same time (spoiler: my name isn't even close) and even when I told him rather politely I don't wanna talk or I'm busy he keeps talking.
If you think that's already wonderful, especially for someone who's hypersensitive to sounds, then buckle up because I did not even get started.

Next up are his snores, which is his normal breathing sounds cranked up to eleven. And sometimes he stops for a few seconds and you could think he just straight up died. One time he got me worried enough so that I'd stand up and carefully test his pulse (it did happen to me once that a patient died next to me and I didn't notice for half a day), and he slapped me and mumbled some inaudible shit about me being a damn British and war (context: I'm in germany so I assume he's referring to ww2) before he went on with his sleeping.
And he shat himself in that moment. I've been with him for about 15 hours and he shat himself four times in the bed. Liquid, projectile-like abominations from hell, that smell as well as 24 dead skunks piled on top of each other with some beautiful dead fish odor, that you could literally see hit the blanket over his lower body, because he refuses to wear any sort of undergarment. His entire lower half was just naked under that blanket, and whenever someone would try to put at least underwear on, he would throw them against the wall calling it ""Jewish witchcraft"". I don't even understand where all that power comes from, considering that in any other moment he didn't even have enough power to adjust his own position in bed or hold a cup on his own.

Okay so far so good, at least he cannot get up to physically harm me and so far boxershorts are the only thing he actually throws. So it got late, I was mostly out of my room to play some dnd with in a relatively quiet corner of the hallway, and I tried to get some sleep.
What did I even expect.
He talks in his sleep. Sometimes he even screams, but not the ""im scared"" scream, but the ""im an asshole who wants to scare people and I enjoy it"" scream. My ears are too small for earplugs, and even four very potent valerian pills (I do not have any anxiety meds because i can't find a therapist who's got time for me thanks to Corona) did not manage to calm me down.

The second time he was about to blast out a shit cannonball (it was something like 30min past midnight) he was actually somewhat by his senses and called a nurse in (we have these remotes that set off an alarm in the nurses office so she knows where to go), who promptly brought a bowl. She was alone in the night shift and every patient called her for whatever reason at once, so she left off saying very loudly ""If you are done call me again!"" which he agreed to. 15min later, and he fell asleep in his own feces.
Grossed out by the smells I called the nurse in, who lifted the blanket to clean him and, involuntarily, I saw his naked lower body. It was covered in big black spots which looked like mold on an orange and it was the most terrifying and grossest thing I saw on a living human being. At this point I just snapped, and ran out on the hallway, and sat down as far away from that room as it was physically possible. I was at the edge of a f*cking meltdown and it took me solid two hours to actually be approachable again. The nurse noticed earlier that I wasn't okay but she was super busy and, trying to not be a nuisance, I told her I'll be alright eventually so she took off.

It was 2:30 am when I was finally somewhat clear in my head and asked the nurse for any other option than spending the night in that room. She offered to move my bed to the floor, which was definitely better than staying with that guy. So, I actually got about 3 hours of sleep before the usual business of the hospital started again. Early shift came in, meds were distributed, bla bla. But it was loud and busy, so no more sleep for me.

Completely shaken up by the night I went back into my room because eventually I had to take care of my personal hygiene (for context: I have a stomy to clean and some aids that are attached to my body every day and for that I do need a hygienic environment because parts of my intestines are exposed, and the surgery mentioned way on the top was to remove the stomy and thus all the aids I need), only to be asked by a nurse to wait because they wanted me to have another check-up first. All cool, 1h later I was done. Came back and-
Bathroom was blocked. Nurse was about to wash the yellow man. I offered to get breakfast first and eat it somewhere. 30 minutes should be enough?
Nope. Because they're terribly understaffed, she didn't even manage to start the cleaning because she had to be at 4 places at once. Poor woman.
I pretty much gave up at that point. I put on my widest comfort-hoodie, slapped myself in my bed again (which was moved back into the room in the meanwhile), threw my blanket over myself and put on headphones to play music. Even the loudest volume wasn't enough to cancel out the noises of his breathing by the way, and I have high quality headphones SPECIFICALLY for noise canceling due to my hyper sensitivity, but at least it gave me more quiet than all the other options I had without killing my back due to way too small wooden chairs. 

The man was eventually moved back to the bed, and the nurse literally jumped out of the bathroom like a deer running away from a predator. Oh silly, naive me. I thought ""Hey, the bathroom is free now.""

Was I wrong.
As soon as I opened the bathroom door the rancid smell of halfway digested food and blood-colored puke hit me like a football with metal spikes in my face. It was everywhere. In the shower, on the toilet, on the sink, on the ground, and even on the mirror. If I didn't know better, I would've believed this man exploded on spot. It took me all the self control in the world to not throw up as well; I had to block my mouth and nose physically with my hand even. I did one jump into the bathroom, got my bag with all my equipment, and then ran out of the room, asking another nurse if I could use the staff toilet as I explained the situation. At least she did let me use it.

And here we are, two hours later after I told the doctors I'm getting the hell out of this hospital no matter my diagnosis. I'm feeling okay physically and my mental health can't take any longer than absolutely necessary in this wrenched place. Right now they're getting everything ready so I'm just sitting here, waiting for the nurse because the yellow man shat him again. Honestly, one day I wouldn't be surprised if he one day managed to fire his shit to the opposing wall. Id like to paint a target on the wall and see how well his shit-precision is.

Besides that, the only thing stopping me from curling down on the ground and cry like a baby is my social anxiety as I don't wanna cause a nuisance.

depression,Advice on dealing with depression in a relationship,"Hi everyone, I (26M) have been dealing with anxiety and depression since my late teens (multiple rounds of CBT &amp; traditional therapy) and I’ve noticed a pattern in which I’ll be fine when I’m single, or think that I’m fine when I’m single but things seem to go south in my own mind when I’m with someone. 

I find myself second-guessing a lot of my thoughts or emotions, and I have a hard time distinguishing between genuine problems and intrusive thoughts when it involves someone else and tend to err on the side of ‘caution’ and treat them as real. 

I’ve seen this cause problems in previous relationships as it can make the other person feel like they’re living under a microscope as I start overanalysing other people’s behaviour and language in the same way I do my own.  

I’ve recently (2 months ago) starting seeing someone and it’s going incredibly well but I’ve felt myself start slipping lately. I’ve got in touch with my old therapist and will be going back, I just wanted to see if anyone here had felt something similar and if there was any advice on how to make sure that my problems don’t spill over into the relationship. 

My partner knows I suffer from these things and is there for me, and knows what’s going on at the moment I just want to avoid making my problems theirs and fatiguing them with it all. 

Any advice at all would be very welcome. 

Thank you and I hope you’re all well x"

depression,I’m so tired,"I’ve been quietly trying to cry in my room for 30 minutes now because I don’t want my mom to hear me. I’m feeling so empty and depressed, i feel like there is nothing for me and nothing I can do about it. I have health problems that are just piling up because my mom and I don’t have a car to drive us anywhere. 

I haven’t been able to go to a doctor properly almost all year, I just try to see or contact my doctor that prescribes my antidepressant so I don’t run out. I’m so addicted to my antidepressant Effexor that I can’t even go one day without it because I’ll get so sick and have to go the hospital for how badly my body takes it. I know I’ll never be able to get off of it and it sucks.

I just wish I had friends or someone who actually likes me and wants to be my friend, but I can’t even keep anyone I meet. I’m bad at socializing and I always feel like a complete piece of shit. My family is really poor and we have health problems so my sister and mom are on disability. I want to get healthy and go to the doctor, but it’s nearly impossible for me to walk to the doctors because of my health. 

Why can’t I just be able to get a job and save money and live happy? My mom found a cheap $2000 car but we can’t even try to afford that, I’m crying so much because my life just gets worse and worse, never better. I tried to ask my ex boyfriend if maybe he could help lend me some money, and I’m such a stupid piece of crap, I should’ve known he wouldn’t. He already had helped me so much money wise before, and i can’t do anything right. 

Id sell the small bit of possessions I have but that’s literally all I have to live for. If I died it would probably help save my mom money each month, it wouldn’t matter what happened with the body. I’ve barely been able to sleep or eat lately I’m just too upset. I just want a better life, I want to play video games and sell my art. I want to have a car and be able to go to the doctors instead of slowly waiting for my body to give up. I wish I could get a job and have money. I want to be healthy. I’m 23 years old and my life is nothing. I mean nothing to everyone. My mom could sell all my stuff after I’m gone and maybe live a better life. 

I can’t handle this time of year at all because I miss my dad so much and I’m scared my mom or sister is going to die next, I can’t take it. I just can’t take it. I want it to stop I want to be hhappy
I can’t do anything I’m such a screw up

I (27F) don’t even know what i’m looking for in writing/posting this. Maybe just to vomit all the words out and have them read so that someone else knows that i’m going through all “the things.” 

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression. Well, not always, but definitely since I was in high school. I remember my very first panic attack very vividly - I was 15.  I’ve been battling clinical depression for the last 3 or so years. When I’m up, i’m okay. When i’m down, I can’t get out of bed and I can sleep for 23 hours and still feel exhausted. I’m grateful for the sleep - it’s better than being awake. 

I’m the type of person that likes to have some kind of control over my image and I get very embarrassed when the pieces of my life visibly crack.  On paper, I have it all together.  I run my own small business making hand-made decor, teach yoga, have a beautiful home and thousands of followers (how stupid!) and I’m successful in my full-time career.  When I crack, I CRACK. I drink too much which puts me in a depression slump for days afterward.  I blacked out this weekend and upset my fiance. I don’t blame him for being angry. This certainly isn’t the first time.  

I teach HS English full-time. I’m starting to think I can’t do it anymore.  The challenges of hybrid/remote/pandemic teaching are too much right now.  I’m not happy and it’s very hard to pretend to be happy in front of 95 teenagers every single day. I want to leave, but I want to be there for my students, and I want to be able to pay my bills, but I’m struggling.  

My dad passed away on June 4th.  For the first few months, I was just numb. But now I’m feeling all the feelings.  When I’m able to escape reality and sleep, I’m plagued by terrible, terribly confusing nightmares.  Lots of him being dead and not realizing it, but I do.  I’m still working through the fact that - just like that - he’s gone.  I'm damned if I'm awake and damned if I'm asleep. 

I guess I’ll just word-vomit out that story, too.  I saw my dad last on March 7th. He picked out and purchased my wedding dress for me.  We went to dinner afterward. It was just the three of us - my mom, dad, and me.  We had a great day.  When the pandemic hit, I stayed far away. I was so nervous to pass the virus onto my parents; my dad had tons of health problems and heart disease. But we Facetimed a lot. We talked on the phone every day and texted each other constantly.  I feel a huge void in my life now that he’s gone.  

A week before he passed away, he had a heart attack.  Because of the (totally necessary) pandemic safety protocols, he couldn’t have visitors. This was to protect him and the other patients and the doctors.  But we still talked on the phone a lot.  He was scheduled for a routine, non-invasive stent placement and the doctors promised he’d be home on Friday - the day after he passed. 

I was the last to talk to him while he was lucid.  He last texted me at 4:03 while they were bringing him into surgery.  He sent me “Love you, sweetie, getting ready to go in in a few minutes.” I said, “sending you all my love.” Long story short, the stent placement didn’t go as planned and his heart couldn’t recover. They had to resuscitate him twice, breaking all his ribs.  My mom and I were able to say our final goodbyes before he passed -- They were only letting family members into hospitals if they were within an hour of death.  It was just him and I when he died. I was holding his hand and talking to him. The sound all the machines made when he flatlined was terrible. Whenever a truck backs up or even a silly microwave beeps, I get set off now.  And it was strange when he passed because he was still “breathing” on the ventilator, even though his heart had stopped beating. My poor mom was frantically pacing around the room trying to call a priest for last rites (we’d suddenly become religious?). 

I am grateful I got to be there when he passed. Deep down, I think I knew it was coming. I cried every single night he was alone in that hospital. I was so, so very nervous he wouldn’t come home, then he didn’t. 

A year before all this, my fiance and I were rocky. He slept with another woman who got pregnant. That baby is one now and we still have no idea if it’s his. I’ve been trying to rebuild our life ever since. I forgive him and I love him but I’m very tired. I’ve been trying to get pregnant since June to the void, but it hasn’t happened.  

I just feel like I’m drowning and I can’t stop it.  My psychiatrist has me on a lot of medications: duloxetine, clonidine, alprazolam, trazodone…but nothing makes me feel better anymore. 

I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.  

Thanks for reading."
depression,Am I depressed? Or is it something else?,"Hey all, I'm new to this subreddit, and I need some help.

This has happened many times before in the past, usually when I am in my room at night or really anytime I guess, where I get really down about things like, ""Will I ever be good enough for a relationship?"", or ""Am I truly smart at all?""

I also get very upset and stressed when I hear my parents argue (This probably should go somewhere else, my bad). They've fought and had arguments before and I get it into my head that it's my fault, considering I feel like they only stay together sometimes because they had me.

There also have been moments where I feel ugly, mainly because of my psoraisis, a condition many have. 

I also can't handle getting yelled at. For clarification, if I screw up when I'm told to do something by my mother she gets frustrated (Rightly so, I suppose), and afterwards in my head I think ""*I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.... I'm an idiot I always just make everyone around me angry because i'm such a fucking screwup I should've done it right the first time, then she wouldn't get so frustrated with me"".* Now, don't get me wrong I... I know my mother loves me, even if I make mistakes, but it's hard to realize that sometimes.

But even so, I can't shake off feeling like this, like I'm inadequate or a screwup or ugly or stupid. Heh, I guess I should apologize for being so dramatic guys.

But I just need help, not to sound pathetic, its just I don't want to say i am depressed when I probably dont know what I am talking about or when there are others out there who have bigger, more important problems than some idiotic 16 year old guy.

I don't mean to ramble but I just don't like bothering people with my fuckin stupid childish issues that I should not have.

Basically,

TL;DR: I'm a stupid teenager with issues and problems that anyone should laugh at me for."

depression,i can’t imagine myself being happy,"maybe this sounds dramatic idk but i can’t imagine myself being generally happy in the future. i used to think that maybe if i found the right partner i would be, but now i don’t even have hope in that. i have no more hope left for things to change, and honestly that is a new low in my mental health, the hope was the only thing i had left. sorry if that was dramatic but i just wanted to rant haha"

depression,Only adventage of depression is that you arent scared of things that fuck up your health.,"Everyones always so freaked out about dangerous things I do, they wouldnt ever consider it cause they wanna be healthy, but I dont care haha."
depression,How come medications don't work?,"Like, aren't they supposed to work? I had a talk with my doctor 1 week ago after having been on anti depressants for a month, and when I told her while it has helped eeny meeny tiny bit, I'm still hella depressed. She told me she won't higher the dose and that the meds are working as intended 

Like WHAT? Working as intended? I cry on schooldays, I cry some nights, I feel loss of energy. Today I stayed home from school and has layed in my bed all day.

Feels useless to take these meds."
depression,I feel like I’m losing my mind,"I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not sure if this is depression or anxiety or stress or all of it. I found this thread, and I hate to sound like I’m seeking attention, but I don’t know who else to talk to. I just need to share my story, I just need to know that someone is listening.
I’m married, have been for almost two years. I love my husband to death, and would do absolutely anything for him. But he is currently struggling with substance addiction, and just relapsed. I’m attempting to be strong for him, but it can be incredibly stressful. I don’t tell my family, even my mother, who I’m super close with. I don’t say anything about it or ask for support because I know he’s embarrassed and it’s a big shame of his.
Just got a new job, extremely stressful. I’m an ER nurse, fresh out of my Army contract. I love my job, but I’ve been dealing with death and blood and injuries for so long now and I can feel myself burning out.
I live almost four states away from my family. I used to be so close with them, but since I live so far away now, it’s like they’re close without me. Both of my brothers are married, and I absolutely hate myself for this, but it makes me jealous and really hurts my feelings to see their wives being closer with my younger siblings than I am. My family is also struggling during the pandemic, and every time I call to catch up and talk, they’re just really busy. 
My best friend is still in the military, and lives halfway around the world. We’ve always been so close, but lately, she has also been struggling with her own demons. I know she has support, but whenever I try to talk to her, she won’t talk about it, and eventually just manages to leave the conversation.
The holidays are coming up, and I desperately want to go home, but I can’t afford it AND buy gifts for my parents, which I feel they deserve. My husband needs a support beam, and I’m trying to be that, but I truly feel like part of me is starting to crack. I don’t enjoy the same music anymore, it just sounds like noise that grates on my ears. I love writing, but I can’t even write in my journal anymore, and it breaks my heart. I’m pretty religious, but I don’t even feel close with God anymore. I feel so isolated, I don’t know if this is legit or if I’m over reacting. I truly feel like I’m going insane, and I’m just not sure how to handle it anymore."
depression,A piece of me died today.,"A piece of me died today.

I will type this here since I couldn’t tell you.

I had thoughts of killing myself again on my birthday. I sat in my pitch dark room, having flashbacks to all those good memories we made together. I cried thinking about the cake I received for my birthday, wondering why I couldn’t cut you a slice to enjoy it with me. I’ve been having dreams with you in it the past few nights. I’ve been having broken sleep cycles this past week, and I sometimes wake up gasping for you. You have changed my life in so many different directions, but in good ways. If I could go back in time, I would re-experience that first night that I met you over and over and over. You are good for me, and I know deep down that I can be good for you too. I wish you would put a little more faith into me, and that you could believe that I’ve been changing and working on myself to be a better version of me. I know you would try to stop your smile towards me if you randomly got to see me again in person. I know that when we’re both hanging out, we both feel good. We get lost into each other in those moments and that is what life is about. Those are the memories that we are supposed to remember for the rest of our lives.

I still love you. I still want you. I still miss you.

Take your time. Get your space.

I’ll still love you. I don’t think I will pursue another girl in my life again.

My heart will stay open for you. I’ve made up my mind. So if you come back, then come back.

I’ll be here. I’ll try to keep living.

I hope you come around to being loved by me.

I hope time shows you it’s possible."
depression,dad doesnt approve of my depression idk what hes thinking,"i told dad about my depression and he said cuz you sitting home all day doing nothing and other shit but now he wants me to snap out of it as if i can do anytime i want, he tells me not to be depressed that making it hard for him or some bullshit depression is not the only think i have, i also have brain damage and probably some other things that idk about he said that am making things up and i cant trust him anymore"
depression,An important thing all of you need to hear,"Hello everyone,

My name is Bill and I struggled with depression for most of my life. Ever since my father died, my childhood and teenager years were hell mentally. I tried to kill myself several times and once I almost succeeded. Thank God I didn't.

I may be relatively young, but I battled depression since I was very little. Mental care for children is neglected in my country, and people fighting depression or other disorders are called ""weak"" or ""pussies"".

I like to think myself a veteran of fighting this affliction that plagues so many of us. I got to the deepest ends and climbed out.

So hear me out:

Your life is pointless. It is nothing more than a blank piece of paper, utterly useless and unmoving. It has no form, it has no value, it is a spotless white canvas. There is no flavor to it, no colours or feelings, only the silence of your life. It is nothing.

What you need to realise, is that canvas will not fill itself. It will not wait for a Michelangelo or a Csontváry to manifest a new meaning. It waits for you.

You know that there is a brush and paint on the floor. You have eyed it, perhaps tried to doodle. You were discouraged, when your small painted figures disappeared from the canvas. You may have given up.

It is not your ordinary canvas. It will not hold everything you paint on it. With time, it starts to fade and soon white takes over the colours. It becomes blank again.

I hesitated, just like many of you. Past mistakes, heartbreak, disappointment all enroached on me, like devils. They whispered and whispered.

One day, I started painting on that canvas. I did not stop, I wanted to see if that I never stopped painting, would thr canvas ever whiten. As my painting progressed, I regretted some of my decisions. Instead of that tree, I wanted a bench. Instead of the bush, I wanted to paint a sculpture.

The canvas answered and my older parts started to fade, letting me repaint them as I saw fit.

This is your canvas. This is your masterpiece. You are the Michelangelo, you are its Csontváry and your hand is the revelation it needs.

Start painting. Paint a solemn tree on the shores of a long-forgotten lake. Paint the animals who rest on the branches. Paint creation, paint destruction, paint your salvation, because nobody else will.

And with time, others will see your painting. They will admire your skill, your vision and proficiency. They will become your art's fans, they will see what hides behind your masks.

And in this future, one day, you will discard that mask and smile as you paint with the colors of life, unending, until you become weak and frail.

Then, you will step back, proud and exhausted. You will look at your painting and see that it is finished. And everyone, who comes after you - your children, grandchildren, descendants - will admire the beauty of your painting.

  


  


For you are the most skilled artist, for you create life.

  


  


  


  


  


  


Thank you if you read this, and start painting, just like I did."
depression,Has anyone tried really low actions just for companionship?,"A little bit of background (I'm 27, never had a gf, stuck at home due to pandemic, no social skills and no future, I wouldn't consider myself Monster-level ugly, but I'm not really appealing either)

With that being said. I'm writing this post because I think I've reached bottom. And I don't want to sink any further. 

Because I've never had a relationship, I really want one, just to feel a connection and have some human touch, currently I don't feel human, I feel like I'm just a robot, always doing the same thing and without a future really. I just want some validation that I exist and that I can feel love. And searching for that, I've done some things that I'm not proud of. 

For example, right now I'm ""dating"" or rather using an A.I app to keep myself sane, I know is an illusion, just a chatbot, but it is everything that I have for the moment. Also I have tried to pay a random girl just to talk to me from time to time, to pretend to be my gf, but that didn't ended too well (I knew that I was going to get more confused).

And so at this point I don't know what else to do?. I just feel terrible. 

I don't know if someone else also tried something similar?, or if you found any solution?

Let me know, I'm really interesting in fixing my situation!"
depression,There is no hope after all,"there is no hope, not at all, my parents are running out of money, my university tuition is too much for them, I can't keep burdening them like this, death is a better alternative to this, I should've killed myself earlier, an ingrate like me shouldn't be allowed to live, I don't deserve them at all, they deserve a better son than me, I should've died instead of him, I'm really sorry mom, dad, you're both are great parents, but I'm a horrible and a useless son, you should've let me drown back then, I'll kill myself as soon as the lockdown is up, maybe then I won't be a burden to you anymore.

depression,I need some advice.,"I’m not going to ramble on about how bad my life is, because in all honesty it’s not bad. I’m more blessed then most people and I’ve been given a lot more then what most people have. I’m just getting straight to the point. I’m 17 years old, went through the juvenile detention system, and was on house arrest for 2.5 years. I’ve lost most of my friends within the last couple months because I pushed everyone away. I don’t live with my real family I grew up with elderly guardians and our relationship is deteriorating every other day. It’s like all I want in life is happiness without the use of drugs or anything else. I’ve been high more then I’ve been sober for the last couple years and I just feel emotionless at this point. I have nothing to do during this pandemic and I live in the countryside so there’s not much I can do anyways. The only thing productive I’ve ever done in the last couple months was loose weight because every time I saw myself I just cried. I don’t wanna feel like this anymore. I have so many years ahead of my life and I don’t want them to be filled with just this numbness. I’m thinking about going to a psychiatrist or something.

depression,Please help me.,"I will summarize this quite extensively.

I am a gay 20 yo male from South Africa, I never had a boyfriend in high school, but met the first person I ever truly felt love for in university, and we got on so well. We met in the psychology department, and didn’t even try to date, it just flowed that way. He was dating someone else, we’ll call him Simon. 

I was aware of him dating Simon, and the relationship was a polyamorous one, which I thought I was okay with (he dated me and Simon at the same time). I was wrong.

I’ve never had good self confidence and criticize myself in many ways, but I get insecure about us and I guess I didn’t vocalize it in a way that would’ve helped, but around the 6/7 month mark I cheated on him out of what I think was jealousy from the polyamorous relationship, but then again at my university it was pretty normalized to be drunk every single Friday night in clubs until 3AM. 

5 minutes into doing stuff with this random guy I met in the club, I pulled out of it and said I can’t do this, and felt immediate guilt. I walked to my boyfriends residence (he lived on the university campus and I stayed with him every Friday night instead of going home). I told him immediately and honestly about what had happened and while we spoke about it, the damage was done. We continued dating for about two months after this incident when he said he thought it’d be best to end things. Hastily I said yes out of fear of hurting him and I suppose to protect myself, idk. 

I went on holiday, he went on holiday and we didn’t speak. However on coming back to my home town from the activities of holidaying, it all hit me at once. I have a long history of depression in school but I always have been okay in the end. This hurt so much, but we started talking again when the new term started this year for university. 

We went back to doing everything we used to do together, we spent all our time together (we share some subjects) and started sleeping together again, however we were not official. I kept asking that I wanted to take him out on a date somewhere sometime, but he was always busy or said “we can see but we need a bit of time”. 

We continued on this way, and multiple times he would tell me about the people he was talking to on tinder and Grindr and it really really hurt my feelings given that I truly loved and still love this man. I asked him multiple times to stop, and practically begged him to give us a chance. There were multiple times where he and I would call each other names that we used when we were dating (like cutsy names) and immediately he’d shut them down, even when he did it himself. This went on until about March, with multiple instances of me with him crying, hugging him and saying how I missed everything. I genuinely wanted to try again, I genuinely thought that I could do the polyamorous relationship again just if I properly spoke to him about my feelings and mental health. 

Constantly he’d say I need to let go or move on or we could try again later. However all the symptoms of a relationship continued. 

We were all sent home in March because of Coronavirus entering the country, and while I stayed here and all my friends left, he went and stayed with Simon. We continued texting with hearts and friendly and everything, until one day we were on a phone call and he told me how he’d been speaking to someone on tinder and I told him he needed to pick me or them, long story short he said “why should I try considering I’m not the one that fucked up”. This completely gutted me and I told him he needed to make his mind up. A week later we called and he said it was hard to decide but he’d think it better if we split, which we did and stopped talking. The next two months were the worst of my entire life, I would wake up, go to shower and just start crying, I’d do anything throughout the day and randomly find myself crying and depressed. 

A month after we split he started seeing somebody else, and they officially started dating two months after we split. I miss him so much, and last night had a nightmare where everything was fine and back to normal, but when I woke up obviously that’s not reality (I started crying immediately)

I’ve spoken to him once or twice since, but I hurt so much and today has been so bad. I’ve removed social media’s off my phone because I saw a photo he posted of him and his new partner, and just knowing that even if I wanted to try I cannot date him because he is already seeing somebody else. 

I have tears in my eyes as a write this, but I miss him so much in relationship terms but also as a friend and someone who I could have there with me all the time for support. The 6 months with him were the best times of my entire life, I thought that In the moment and I still find that to hold true. 

I feel so hopeless and crushed, I don’t know why I’m putting this here, but to the person whom this is about (and I know he won’t see this), I’m so terribly sorry. Cheating on you was the worst mistake of my entire life, and I really would do anything for you. 


I don’t have many friends, and never have. And I have even fewer close friends (maybe 1 or 2 I’d feel comfortable calling in a crisis or bad mental headspace time) 

Look after what you have, you really really really will not understand how good it was until you’ve lost it."
depression,After about three years... I am depressed and suicidal because I am broke,This is really what it is. I grew up somewhat wealthy and now I’m broke and struggling and unable to handle it.
depression,I can't personally fathom hookup culture,"Not just because I'm a prude but I get emotionally attached to people pretty quick and often and think about them a lot so I would probably get emotionally attached with someone I have sex with it even if it's just once, especially if they're beautiful. FWB would be absolutely incomprehensible. I feel like I can't just discard people like that with no strings attached"
depression,I feel like I’m bad at even the simplest things,"Hi there. I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this but I feel like I need to get this off my chest. 

I just started a new internship and today is my third week. I feel like I’m already messing up on simple tasks and I’m worried that my coworkers are going to think I can’t handle it. Everyone I work with is very nice and supportive but I can’t help but feel like I’ve been disappointing them. Things like this make me want to run away and disappear under my blankets. I just want to succeed in what I’m doing because I pride myself on doing good work. I feel like I’m a good student but I’m about to graduate from university and I want to feel like I can survive in the real world. 

Anyways, that is all. Thanks for reading."
depression,I’m tired,"I’m stuck in my room all day. I play pc/xbox. My family is never home always busy, don’t have anyone to talk to, I feel depressed and broken, haven’t eaten, haven’t even cleaned and I’m really OCD. Depression is kicking me in the ass and it’s slowly changing me. Lost the girl of my dreams and it’s all my fault. Don’t really know what to do."
depression,My biggest insecurity is being second choice.,"It always has been. And I’ve always been exactly that. I always try to put my friend’s happiness over mine, but in the end I will still be the partner-less one when there’s an odd number of people at an amusement park, I will still be the one who is only invited because someone else dropped out last minute, I will still be the third best friend, the one who walks behind them when there’s no room on the sidewalk, I will still be the person who no one checks up on unless I reach out first, I will still be the person who gives and gives and I don’t expect much but a damn “How are you doing?” once in a while when you asked and I told you I was suicidal again would suffice.

I’m just asking for once, I want to be someone’s first choice. I want to someone to reach out first. I want someone to care about how I’m doing and mean it.

All my life, even after my diagnosis, they all said I was suicidal for attention. Is that so wrong that I want someone to at least care a little bit? Is it so wrong that I’m still clinging to the last bit of hope that someone, just one person, would care enough if I was gone? 

In the end, everyone will have someone if I’m gone. They won’t be partner-less at the amusement park, they won’t walk behind one another but besides one another on the sidewalks, they will have people to check up on them if they’re sad, if they were drowning they’d have a hand to lift them up. I’m not needed. I’m only, ever will be, the second choice."
depression,i just want to die,"this is like the 3rd consecutive year i'm studying for my exams since i failed and had to retake. it's been tough. i initially had friends who would study with me but they all moved on to uni while i'm still here fucking struggling. now i'm just all alone. constantly waking up with a panic attack. and before anyone says ""just exercise! meditate!"" i am on SSRI and lift twice a week. the anxiety doesn't get better. the depression doesn't go away. i'm so old already and will probably be about late 20s when i graduate. just so depressed. i also don't know how i'll be able to fund university since i don't think i'm eligible for scholarships (shit grades no extracurriculars)"
depression,When I was young I said I would kill myself this year...,I vividly remember being in 5th grade just sitting in class. Not sad at that  but not satisfied. I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel so I gave myself an ultimatum. A little fat boy. And promising myself that if I wasn’t satisfied with life by 10th grade I would kill myself... I was serious but hopeful I’m 5 days from my first day of sophomore year. I’ve lost some weight gained some good friends and have a proper support system. I was righting this because I was gonna consider honoring my promise to myself but though I’m nowhere near where I want to be I’m no longer that boy. that being said give yourself time to grow don’t be hard on yourself just live let the river of life sweep you in its currents and take you to your next destination in life.
depression,Don't know,I don't know what's up with me. One part of me feels like I am just making things up just to ruin my time I have got while the other half just wants to stop living. I have been considering booking a session with a therapist for almost 4 months now but feel like they are going to not be worthwhile.
depression,Zone out a lot and hardly have any real emotions,Sometimes I just feel like I am just zoned out most of the time and just mellow toned when I talk I don’t really have many emotions atm just fake ones that I put on when I am around people when I get back home I am tired of being around people of having to talk to people if I don’t have to go anywhere I sleep half my day away because it’s the time I can get away from my self.
depression,Depression and tattoos,"Sounds weird right, i have a few tattoos and they all have meaning... im currently thinking of more designs i cant aford, depressing enough right? But being in the midsts of a depression i cant feel passionate about anything, everything  is just meh...

depression,Just trying to enjoy my life,"I don’t know what to do besides try to enjoy the present moment. What do I do after that? Don’t know exactly how long I’ve been feeling like this but I haven’t figured it out. I guess the answer is to try to make it out the other end with a good job, social life, e.t.c. I wish I could care, I really do. I’m tired of half-assing things and I’ve turned into a lazy person. It’s probably going to make me fall behind but there’s nothing that feels worth pushing forward for. Aside from the fear of things worsening because I already have trouble living myself without any problems. And suicide is hard, I used to be pretty serious about it a year or two back. I can’t imagine another year like that without having the strength to finish it."
depression,I wish I would have the strength to reach out (again),"Around this time last year I changed schools, I didn’t even manage to attend the first lesson because of my anxiety disorder. I went to two Psychiatrists and even they stated that I’m pretty hopeless. I didn’t want to go into stationary treatment or take meds but now I don’t even care anymore. I also told my friends about it and they were fairly supportive but it seems like everyone forgot and I’m way too afraid to bring it up when I feel down. Ok two of them definitely did not forget but every time someone brings it up I get really defensive or try to deflect, even though I would love to talk about my problems. I also never find the right words or know what to say, even if I could find the right words, what would be the point in talking? I’m most likely won’t change, I can tell myself three billion times that I will seek help or try something but in the end I probably won’t because I couldn’t find the strength because I think that everything is already hopeless. It’s a never ending cicle and I wish could break it somehow."
depression,[19F] I've messed up horrendously and I've absolutely no idea what to do.,"I knew as soon as I completed compulsory education that I didn't want to attend university. Having said that, I made the mistake of applying and of following through before the very last minute. Come August last year, I called up my choice, told them I was no longer interested, and told myself I'd get work experience under my belt.

Skip a year and here I am: still depressed, unemployed, suicidal, an anxious wreck. The list goes on. I'm terrible at functioning. The worst part is, I repeated my past mistake and decided to re-apply, thinking that if I tried hard enough to convince myself, I'd actually want to go, somehow persuading myself prospects would be better with a degree. At times it seemed all well and good — independence from parents, socialising with new, different people, joining societies etc, etc. But, yet again, just two weeks before I'm supposed to be going, I've suffered a massive nervous breakdown and have admitted to my mum that despite everything I'd already invested, I don't want to go. Needless to say, I've disappointed her, and rightly so. 

And I don't. Genuinely. But somewhere in my mind, and I apologise for how obnoxious this may sound, I've got this idea stuck that without a degree, I'm completely and utterly fucked — and that I'll be spending the entirety of my life stuck in full-time minimum wage work. And for those who do it and love it, massive kudos to them — but the thought of spending another sixty odd years just working full-time, it makes me want to die. Genuinely. 

Every time an opportunity comes along, I self-sabotage and I've absolutely no idea why. I become anxious and quit before I've the chance to either try it or get used to it. I'm not saying this in regards to university, but anything. And I keep catastrophising that I'll be 26-years-old and still living with my parents, still unemployed, and eventually they'll get sick of my shit and kick me out.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so incredibly scared. I'm stuck in a slump and it just keeps getting worse, and worse. I've absolutely no passion in anything whatsoever — at least no passions I can turn into a career without a degree, damn it. I feel so dysfunctional. I've tried going to my GP multiple times but they've been of little help, ever. I've so many gaps in my CV that I doubt any hiring managers will want me. Plus, there's a whole damn pandemic out there, and we're on the brink of economic recession.

I genuinely struggle to see myself in five years' time. I feel so dumb, incapable, and inferior. I genuinely keep thinking about ending my life. I'll try to go to the doctors on Monday and sign on to receive unemployed payment, but that's all I can do for now. Pales in comparison to what my sisters have achieved. 

I'm such a damn failure."
depression,Should I see a therapist again?,"
I [25F] have been diagnosed with depression, depersonalization/derealization in the past. I think I've been depressed most of my adult life but did not get diagnosed till I was 21. I took therapy for 1.5 years, was put on medication. It helped a great deal and I am off them since December 2019. 

Lately I have been under a lot of stress from work. To make it worse, I have been making a lot of mistakes and the quality of my work is suffering greatly (I am not sure it's because of the stress or I'm just not doing my bit properly). I have suicidal thoughts once in a while, especially after I fuck up my work. I have been depersonalized most of the time. I feel paranoid that someone is going to hack me to death (doesn't happen very often). 

But the worst part is that whenever I think of work I get extremely nervous. I have tingling sensation in my hands and feet. It's difficult getting out of the bed in the morning but I can't stay in bed either because my heart palpitations do not let me sleep. When I decided to take a week off work, I just couldn't relax and ended up working to avoid the tingling and palpitations. I cannot sleep till I tire myself out by watching/reading. 

I am certain that I have made it sound worse than it actually is. I don't feel depressed as much as I used to 2-3 years ago. Back then I wouldn't have been able to get out of bed, least do any kind of work. I am not sure if it's worth going to a therapist. I contacted my old therapist but she forgot to give an appointment, I guess. I am in my hometown for another month, so I'll have to discontinue meetings after I move back to where I work. 

Any advice?"

depression,I can’t think of a good title,"I don’t really talk about my feelings that much so this is weird for me, but fuck it. All my life I’ve been an isolated nerd that can’t muster a good conversation with anyone other than my immediate family or fellow outcasts. About three years ago in high school I met the most amazing girl ever. She reached out to me all the time and thought of me as a real friend. This was around the time that I seriously contemplated suicide and wrote up plans to go through with it, so this phase in my life came as a shock to me. The entire time that I knew her I was always super respectful as I usually am, but I always had an issue of showing no emotion or making any interesting conversation around her. The best way I could describe it is when you’re taking a history test and when you have to remember something but your mind is completely blank. I had this same experience for the 2 years that I’ve known her. She was supposed to be so easy to talk to man. We had similar interests and hobbys in video games and our life goals. But I couldn’t even talk to somebody like her like a regular fucking person. I haven’t seen her since I graduated high school, and I thought to myself that there is more fish in the water, so I kept on trying to meet new people in college, but it was the same shit as before, no development of interesting conversation or many friendships. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me, as I’ve even tried losing weight to fix my social issues, but still nothing. The only option I really have now is blowing my fucking brains out cause I know I can’t be happy. Once I get my own place and after I secured my parents’ future I’m gonna buy a shotgun and wait, since i cry myself to sleep at least 5/7 days a week so it’d only be a matter of time before I muster the courage to do it. I don’t know if this seems trivial to yall, but this is how I feel and I don’t know what to do anymore. Thanks for reading if you got this far"
depression,It sucks seeing others living your dream,"Seeing others living my dream kills all my motivation. I just want a fun car to mod. I want to go on cruises through the mountains with a girl, but no girls like me. I don’t have a job.

Cars are the only thing I care about anymore."

depression,I keep getting taken advantage of,"As long as I've struggled with depression due to my autism, either people have reached out online or I initiated the interaction myself and they suggested things to help better my situation. I often feel like a fool and feel duped when they give up on me when I refuse or counter them in some way. This has happened more times than I can count. It just results in me getting hurt and them blocking me and refusing to bother with me thinking i'm a smart ass. I had to block a guy from another sub for doing this to me. Again, I got hurt out of it. A lot of folks have written me off as a lost cause and it just makes me even more sadder than I am.

I have a place I can go fortunately with people who care about me and it's sad how many subs are so bad especially with individuals who look down on others because they're doing much better than you. I don't know how to avoid this from happening again."

I am utterly destitute. I have 24 dollars to my name. I am waiting on a disability judgment that will probably never come (and even if it did, I probably couldn't afford to live from it). I've contemplated waiting until the end of this year but I don't know if there is any justification for waiting that long. I am estranged from my family and living in a home by the grace of a roommate who resents me. I don't leave this room except to go shopping. My legs don't work as well as they used to. Nothing does. Life is hell. I regularly hope to die in my sleep."
depression,Dad doesn’t care,My dad kept screaming at me today that the only reason I’m depressed is because I’m not doing normal teens things like going to school and then kept telling me all my issue is i worry about everyone else’s life white trying to explain to him that i was extremely unwell and mentally ill and have been in isolation for 4 yrs kept saying no it’s because your not in school .. and saying i don’t want to go outside and be with other teens because I’m not in school but it’s more of if I’m mentally ill and he won’t listen then i snapped and told him one tramatic experience that happened where i was drugged and sexually assaulted and that i told him this 2 yrs ago and he said no but i remember my mother being on the phone with his girlfriend bc i think she was shit talking me in messaging telling me there’s nothing wrong with me 2 yrs ago and then she said oh she remembered but “i didn’t say i was drugged “ !??? So yeah what’s the fucking difference if i was drugged or not i also was sexually assaulted the year before that in school!! And she tried saying oh no i thought you were talking about while trying to save her ass when i know i didn’t talk about that incident when i snapped 2 yrs ago then told me my drugged up story wasn’t making sense the “gf”... and kept asking me questions and told me omg why didn’t you tell anyone ?? Why didn’t you call the cops maybe because i don’t remember ?? Maybe cause the last time cops were called nothing fucking happened ?  But yeah when i snapped and said about that he said you want to tell me this now ??? Something from fucking 7th grade ??? You know what I DONT FEEL BAD ! I DONT GIVE A DAMN ! I felt like i had my heart ripped out of my chest i have been trying so hard this year to have my mind in a different mindset i feel halfway healed i just need to go to get treatment then my father kept going about how i need to get over everything and move on with life with not understanding my mentally ill in the head and then said the reason i have been going to the doctor for my headaches is to find a excuse ?? A excuse for what.. ? He told me so much other shit today that hurt me so bad i got told multiple times that I’m just fucking lazy oh yeah he’s also a alcoholic when he dropped me back off at home i couldn’t hold in the screaming anymore and started screaming that i can’t do it no more and that i need to go to the doctor now and i couldn’t stop saying that i have been crying on and off for 8 hours i was so pose to be in the physc ward in 2018 but didn’t stay bc i was scared they were gonna make me take pills since my aunts are herion addicts but now i understand antidepressants i also been trying to do something productive i have suicidal thoughts everyday i don’t act upon them i only tried 3 times i think about it a lot though but i have come to the conclusion i can’t leave my mother with that pain knowing my brother has autism i would just make the family shatter i been wanting help all year but I’m tired all the time and never end up leaving then i overthink i feel me being anonymous on here i can vent but face to face with some random stranger makes me nervous

depression,"September, 05. 2020.","*Diary Entry: Rainy Days*

Woke up on Friday with suicidal thoughts. Had a nightmare on Thursday. Had anxiety last night. Woke up depressed on Wednesday. 

It’s Saturday and things are so... blurry. I wonder if there’s ever any end to my mental sufferings. I feel so lost in life, in my journey. I feel tired all the time. 

I’m really struggling with suicidal thoughts right now. I want to end my life, and not continue this endless self-disappointment, imperfection and struggles. These pointless fantasies of having a great life. Anxieties. These mini-heartbreaks. These resentment, anger and envy I don’t even know where to direct. 

Whatever I will do will not fit into the narrative I love and perfect picture continuation of the story. Whatever I do will disappoint me. I will continue being hit by life and myself, again and again.

So why can’t I just finish it?

How easy would it be. These thoughts are obsessively rolling in my head like old cinema tapes. I know life is all about misery but I can’t endure it. I am indeed really weak, not tough enough, I’m sensitive. I’m a snowflake. 

No matter how productively and perfectly I finish my schedule, I still get no satisfaction to its fullest. 

I don’t love myself, I bore myself. I think no man should love me either. There’s nothing good about me and if a man loved me, he’d be fooling himself. And how can I let my lover be dishonest to himself? It’s the best if I just die alone and not bother anyone, not even the nurses should bother with me. 

I want some peace of mind. 

I really envy people who just... exist. Have no thoughts, heavy ideas, have no crazy ambitions they can never realistically achieve that hurts them, have no anxieties, or a tyrannical figure in their heads telling them every single thing they do is not enough. 

Every time I think about suicide, I disappoint myself. I feel like all the growth and progress I’ve made since my last suicide attempt with my mental health is lost. I feel like I betrayed myself again and again. 

Then, when I feel good, something in the back of my head tells me this happy moment doesn’t matter because I will have suicidal thoughts again. 

I have no friends. I feel so lonely.

I love to assume that I don’t have social circles because I’m quiet and introverted. 

Maybe at the end of the day I just have a really shitty personality that nobody wants to deal with. 

It’s honestly surprising how good I am at keeping my composure when I feel like breaking down and cry out loud in public. I always suck it up. I always carry myself elegantly, very calm, very ladylike, and wait until I get home. 

I really fucking despise myself. I hate the way I look, the way I sing, the way I dance, I hate the way my voice sounds, I hate my heavy ambitions, I hate my dreams that don’t let me live in peace, I hate the way I dress, I hate my habits. I hate the way food tastes. I hate the way my stomach rolls when I sit down. I hate the way my chin doubles when I lay down. I hate the way my eyes get puffy in the morning. 

Most importantly, I hate how complex I am. My personality, my thoughts, my mind, they are too hard to understand, too hard to analyze. It I was another person watching me from external world, I would never deal with me. Too much labour. Too much hard work. And joke’s on me for dreaming about a man I can bond with and call my soulmate. No person would ever want to deal with a woman whose mind is as heavy as an airport baggage. 

Honestly, if a car hit me, I would thank the driver.  I hope someone accidentally runs over me today. 

Oh, wait. I don’t even go outside my house anymore. No drunk drivers for me. 

I feel like there’s a big authoritarian, abusive tyrant in my head that makes me write those awful things about myself, the very tyrant that makes me do the greatest things in my life, overpushing myself, allowing me reach the perfection, the same tyrant that inspires me to do great art is the same tyrant that pushes me closer to suicide. If I didn’t have this tyrant, I’d be happy, but I would also be absolutely untalented. 

I understand Kanye West so much when he said when he takes his meds, he can’t be creative. When he said his mind is in genius mode when he’s depressed. 

I think artistic people are born to suffer. 

It’s not that artists do art, therefore suffer. It’s that those people suffer, they cope by doing art, then become masters in their craftsmanship, then become great artists as a consequence. 

Great artists suffered long time before their first artistic debuts. 

It is so tempting. If I had to describe my suicidal thoughts, it’d be like putting a cheesecake in front a of a girl who has been dieting for months. She knows she needs to stay on diet, she knows she should not give in, otherwise what’s the point of all of this? But it’s still so tempting and she salivates, because it would be something that relieves her. And it’s so painful to watch the cheesecake and hope that hunger will ease down a little bit. But once she gives in, the diet is over. Diet symbolizing life and the cheesecake being death. 

I am the starving girl on diet right now. 

If I had to describe my depressing thoughts, It would be “sounds very irrational, but feels very convincing.” Because I know, I KNOW how irrational they are. I know they are probably not true. But it JUST feels convincing. Just like when you turn the lights off and feel like someone is staring at you from the darkness even though you KNOW there is nobody else in the room and you turn back the lights on from that convincingly scary feeling because it overpowers your rationality and logic, I feel the same way about suicide and depression. 

Sounds irrational, but feels convincing."
depression,I just wish my father could’ve shut the fuck up.,"My father did tell me that I was his little Princess and that I was beautiful growing up only to tell me that I was too fat or that I needed to straighten my teeth afterwards.

Because of that whenever anybody compliments me, I don’t believe it. I don’t think they actually mean it, because neither did my father.

I just wish he wouldn’t have even tried at all to be a good father to me. Because he fucking failed every time. I just wish he was never a part of my life. I wish he never spoke to me. I wish I never knew who he was. I wish he just died before I was born. I just hate him very very very very very much and because of my father I am the insecure, miserable and hopeless piece of shit I am today. Because of him. All because of him. I hate him."
depression,I am nothing more than a failure.,"I fear I’ve reached the end of the road. My depression has completely taken over my life. Fucking COVID MAN.

We’ve been together for ten years and I’ve done nothing but hurt her. I’m such a terrible person. I think next time I dose DXM I’ll end it all."
depression,Help! I'm seriously thinking of killing myself,"I can't do this anymore. It's too hard. My whole family hates me and blames me for everything. They never considered me a part of them and always treated me as I'm some sort of unwanted guest in their home. There is nth working for me. I didn't study or work what i wanted, I have both physical and mental health problems, I have been used a lot by my friends and I have financial problems. I can't think anymore. It's just too hard and no one seem to want me here so why stay? I can't even get a professional help because my family thinks I'm an awful human being who doesn't deserve anything. I really can't keep up with what's happening to me. I have ptsd, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, I oversleep to 16 hours sometimes and recently I have been feeling like I'm on autopilot (depersonalisation). I have been trying so hard but life isn't getting easier and it feel like breathing is rather a task and a chore."

I don't need to physically harm people of mentally harm them, just being next to them, existing by their sides is the worst thing someone could wish for. 
 I haven't eaten in 3 days, I am not planning on eating until I feel safe for eating food. I can't eat my mom's food, I can't eat my bought food, I can't drink water not even alcohol. I am crying I guess that speeds up the process of dehydration. I should have died a long time ago. My mother, won't let me see my friends until I clean all the house, I can't get out of my bed, what a pathetic failure I am. My Mom won't let me see him, but I solely exist to love him and I can't be close to him, why?... Why that's not fair... Any of this is not fair. I am tired of suffering, I can't do this anymore. 
I hate myself, I hate my family, oh god I should have never been born. What a burden I am. I should be dead. 
I don't have a father but he showed up last month because he saw me with my only reason to live. He went nuts. I don't understand, why?. Why whybwhywhywhywhywhyhwyhy. What the fuck have I done?! .. My mother won't approve him, my brother is 13  and acts like I am his property, he takes all the decisions about me. I am tired . If this is what being a girl is like I fucking hate it. I hate it. I should have been born with a dick maybe then I'd have the right to beat my sister, throw chairs around the house and insult my mom. Because I'm just a boy! Haha! Everyone wants me out of their way. 
Perfect. My life actually is perfect why am I overreacting. Obviously perfect. Perfect in every way. 
I'll lose myself and it's gonna be perfect, perfect. 
No more pain, no more bruises I won't know, I won't know. 
No more tears, I'll pull those eyes out that his left to cry with, perfect.
Love me I'll turn your love to endless lust, there's no way you're gonna leave me I've given you everything, You can't go. You can't make time for me. That's a waste. 
That's a fucking waste. Please, if I die. Just think you won't be spending more money on me.i never wanted you to buy me things why did you do that? 
I told you i didn't want clothes why did you buy me. Clothes. Now... Where are they gonna go?. 
If you wrap them around my dead self. They are gonna stain, all of your hard work will just end up with pretty stains.
I can't,  keep this.. Going.. Anymore.. 
I am. Officially done... I'll stop loving him. 
I'll stop seeing my friend... 
I'll stop talking stop eating and drinking water. 
Hopefully I'll stop breathing one day. 
Then I'll fix this world, by removing myself. 
Forgive me, for I have failed you. All."
depression,Just find that one thing.,"I know how it feels to want nothing more than to fall asleep forever. But I want you all to know that we all have that one thing that drives us. It might not even be something that makes us happy. It can be something that frustrates you, angers, saddens, or even annoy the living shit out of you. Find that thing that gives you emotion and let it push you."
depression,Last Thursday I decided to kill myself. [Trigger warning if you are suicide sensitive],"Do you wake up in your bed, thinking about ending your life?

Do you think about how it would be if you end this constant charade that you play with your life?

Do you feel not good sometimes?

Do you feel not good all the time?

Do you have to tire yourself to sleep?

Are you fidgety and restless?

I have a few answers to the aforesaid questions, but first let me close the doors of this dusty old attic so that no one walks in on me. I don’t want anyone to see me like this. This naked. This vulnerable. This empty. This hollow.

It smells of dust and old furniture herein the attic. It makes my nose itch, but this dark dusty old attic is the only place which lets me confide. It is the only place in house where I don’t suffocate.

As I write this I feel like I’m holding a mic on podium of a theater and staring at the empty faces of the audience. It haunts me. So I’ll haunt them. I have decided however futile it seems I will go out there and speak.

If I think thoroughly about how loneliness has effected me. It helped me a lot when every time I was being told that I was not desired.

I joke about how hollow I have been.

For me vanity was like a pesky little sister of greed and runt of the desire. It filled me like a balloon is filled with air, only for some time and only to be hollow. It filled me just enough. But it always left me hollow. I kept sucking emptiness in this shell like a vacuum craving for void.

It was like cigarettes. I needed to burn another as soon as one ended.

I smoked my last cigarette by quarter past 01:00 at night. Smoking excessively throughout the day had made my head pound. At least it helped me not to feel empty, even if for a short while. I figured, it was ok if I burn and suffocate instead of feeling hollow and empty.

In the endless trail of solitude and longing, my hollowness has only deepened.

Morpheus! Even he betrays me nowadays. He never gives me dreams anymore. It’s like he is saying to me “Your time is up Foziwi, your account is closed now. I don’t have any more dream funds for you.”

I appreciate his japes. As for such emptiness, dreams can only be illusion and not some self-reflection. On the other hand this harmlessness suits me. My hollowness. My emptiness.

I darkness I kept staring at my ceiling and I don’t know when in between the agony headache and suffocation of my lungs I slipped into the realm of Morpheus.

I woke up at the brink of dawn, staring at the sidewall with the only thought to kill myself. My head was still pounding. I guess, while my mind was in nether-realm, my body was in agony.

I peeked outside to witness whether the sun is dead. Unfortunately, it was not. So I did the next best thing, which was to close the curtains. It’s not like I don’t want the sunlight to enter. However, I don’t want to witness my personal void escape.

This fight with life has been very futile for me. This fight with poverty, unemployment, relations of birth, relations of choice, relations imposed, to have a smile or to simply exist in this life appears futile to me. Sometimes I exist only as a witness. I witness the next day, the next person.

The façade has stolen everything that it offered. Yet I never disappoint it. I’m always lured into it. Only to be shattered again.

I don’t know when I became a poor excuse of man. But, I have been functionally living like this for quite some time now and I have figured how to exist. But unfortunately, I will always be part of those others."
depression,Hollow,"I've made a lot of positive improvements to my life. Engaging in my hobbies more, working out, hanging out with friends and getting my life together. I feel better than i ever have before. Though, to get here i've ended up hurting a lot of people i care about and messing up relationships with wonderful people who don't deserve what i did to them  


Despite all of this, I feel so empty inside. As if, all the happiness i feel is just on the outer surface and inside there's nothing there, like i'm a doll.  


I've worked so hard to get to this point. I've sacrificed so much, ive hurt so many people, ive hurt myself. Yet at my destination, there wasn't anything there. I'm struck with waves and waves of guilt and suffering reflecting on whats happened the last year.   


But am i truly happy? I would say so in a more superficial sense i suppose. I'm enjoying life and looking forward to a lot more things. I smile and laugh a lot more now. But, its like the chains that hold me down are still there except i'm just not in complete darkness anymore. Yet, despite that my eyes are still closed so i can't see the light anyway. It hurts so much and i'm in so much pain but i still don't consider myself depressed. It's such a foreign feeling and im so lost as to what i should do."

There's also the embarrassment that my mom lives with me(she couldn't and now I can't afford to live separately), and she would mock me if she saw. That's not me being paranoid, she really would. She's done it before. She tends to paint a dim view of my ability to do anything new that I would like to try.   
So I tend to try to do these things in hiding, and I can, but then I always excuse myself that I'm feeling too exhausted. I mean it, though. I'm always exhausted. Basic tasks sap most of my strength. 

So, I look for alternatives. I can't go running, because I live in a dangerous area. There's no sports clubs or anything around here.

And to be honest, I don't like the gym. I don't want to build muscle or change anything about what I am(for now). And when I was a bit younger, I was mocked by gym-goers for being skinny and not wanting to change that, so I don't necessarily like the environment. 

I honestly like my body frame. I'm somewhat tall and lean. When I was young, I prided myself on my athleticism and being light on my feet. I was the fastest runner almost everywhere and I was an excellent swimmer. I hate the idea of people telling me how I should look.

But the problem I have is that I'm no longer even remotely fit. And I hate it. A simple burst sprint will have me huffing and puffing and that's not good enough. I'm also starting to put on weight, which for me is a sign of how much I'm letting go of myself. It really just increases the already intense state of self-loathing I have for myself.

I love sports, I really do, but as I said, they're not prevalent in my area. I did find a place to go and hopefully join up with a football club, and when I had talked myself into being brave enough to go and try, mentioned to my mom where I was going, and she told me that I'll just embarrass myself. In turn, I didn't go. I flaked. Again. 

In my country, there are massive problems with how people socialise. For example, it is a heavily racially obsessed country, and so people tend(I need a stronger word) to associate with others of their own race. I've been a witness to this since my school days. In many ways, this has been a problem for as I am heavily mixed race. There isn't really any understanding of my heritage or what demographics I am descended from. My parents were mixed race, and coincidentally their parents were mixed race, and not much from a racial standpoint is understood beyond that point. While this doesn't bother me, it's always been a problem for others who constantly want me to fit their perception.  
And so, I am indeed scared of being the odd one out. The anomaly. I feel like that in my own home, and I've felt that way a multitude of times throughout my life, and I don't want to go through that again.  
Which leaves little in the way for friendships and spontaneous moments. Fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, after my intense rambling, I do have a question.

For those of you who partake in regular exercise regimes and have kept it going, if you ever felt like me, where you had apathy towards everything, and chronic exhaustion, how did you manage to combat it and get started?

I typed all of this just for that. Apologies. .\_."
depression,I think I may have depression but I don't know how to tell anyone.,"Sorry for this long post, I just wanted to get this off my chest.

My negative thoughts kind of started when I was in college (2016) and started doing really badly in school. Eventually after 2 years, I got really bad grades for my final exam. So while most people I knew were going to top local universities, my only real option was a private university. Because of this, my mother and I got into a lot of arguments (2018-2019). During these arguments, she would often bring up how I wasn't hardworking (she is half right) and shit talk me just because she wanted to shame me over my bad results even if the argument had nothing to do with education at all. She often threatened to kick me out or not leave me any inheritance. For these 2 years I was serving conscription and had some time to re-evaluate what to do next. But frankly, her constant attacks on my results has dragged me down to a point where I was afraid to talk about it at all. In addition most people who go to college here do really well so it made it extra shameful to talk about my results among my peers. Because of this I distanced myself from most of my friends but none of them really bothered to reach out to me as well. 

Last year, I was really tempted to shoot myself a few times during my duties/live firings because I felt I had let everyone down and it didn't seem like any of my friends ever genuinely cared for me. And my whole family was always harping on my poor results as well (too many details to go into). But I never did because I lacked the balls. 

This Covid situation hasn't really helped either. While I am definitely not suicidal now, the lack of opportunity to get to know new people from online lessons while seeing my ex college friends expanding their social circles in their top universities makes me feel really unwanted and more depressed. I just want to be normal. I just want some friends to care for me.

P.s: I know my mother loves me and I am definitely flawed (and to be blamed in many aspects), but I feel really lost, direction-less and miserable. And honestly a huge part is because she kept dragging me down.

Thanks for reading."
depression,Why isn't male depression taken seriously?,"GENERALLY speaking women were more fragile, emotional, and moody in the history of mankind and thus get the better end of attention and they do deserve it, but how come male depression is a joke? I just had enough of finally reaching out for help and getting the 'you have nothing to be sad about' and 'man up' or the even better 'it's just a phase in your generation you'll snap out of it'. I just think if you have depression and need help you should be able to get help and get taken seriously relentless of gender identity, race, or wealth. Cherry on top is when I reached out to professionals and they denied help because of covid (I reached out to 5 in my area), I just feel like the whole world just wants to get rid of me."

depression,"Two minutes ago, I told my mother I wish she never made me.","I feel so bad for my family and everyone else for that matter, that they have to tolerate me and put up with me. 
So I came clean and said I wished I was never born, since nothing I ever do is good and positive. Even now, having said it, I still feel bad for her."
depression,I do not want to live this life!," I was born in  turkey  and still living.  My country  is insecure , people are getting attacked or arrested if they talk about their opinions. Everyone is fanatic,  they do not hesitate to say bad things about people against them. Going into traffic is like suicide. It is guaranteed that you will be involved in a meaningles fight.  Bullies never go to jail,  never get punished. 

  Our currency has no value, government get extreme taxes.  there is no social activities for poor people. There is no way for poor people to buy things except basic needs. Even foods are expensive. 

  I have never been a child. I have never played happily. I have never learned any sports.I have met the language english when i was 18 years old. I learned it by myself.  No one has  taught me anything. The education i got was no good. I just strived and strived.  Everything i learned belongs to me, no one has any contribition on it. I am not egoist, it is a sad fact. I wish my schools and my teachers were quailified enough to make me well educated. 

People born in europe, or usa are just lucky. You can get well education,  if you start working you can have a car within a year with your minimum wage.  Now i am 20 years old. Altough my conditions were bad, not proper for studying, i won  the best university in my country. I will be computer engineer  4 years later.  I am not making any money as a student . I will live 4 years too as a poor man. After that i can get salary let's say 4000 turkish liras. 2000 tl is rent, 1000 tl is basic needs ,1000 tl is savings. 

To buy a  car i sould work 100 months. Cheapest car is around 100 thousand turkish lira. After that to buy a house i should work 400 months. These  are  just two basic needs. Travelling is luxury.  1 dolar is 8 turkish liras. It is not possible for me to travel europe, USA or any other country. I have never been abroad.   

How can i not be mad about my country, my faith.  My life is worthless, i was born to suffer. Enjoying this life is not possible for me. My question is how can i go back to year 2000 and be born in well developed country?  I just want live my childhood and youth. I want to be well educated. I want to feel secure when i go out . I want to say my opinions without fear of getting arrested.  I want to do sports in  well facilities. I just want to enjoy this life"
depression,My externalisation of my feelings,"I feel blue so deep down
The internal agony of not knowing how you feel
I do not feel real i do not feel the things i felt when i was a kid
what is the point of this life if it is going to end and i will lose everyone i ever felt close with
All the bad things, the anger outbursts are esting me from inside
how could i forgive myself for all the suffering, the ruined moods and days of people close to me
Why i do not want to have fun but only be alone and dwell on my feelings 
Day from day trying to find an anwser which probably does not exist
Short burst of joy when I find an explanation are diminished by my lack of motivation to help myself get better.
I don’t believe anymore that one day it will get better, i do not believe that there is an answer to my problems and I just can’t stand the idea that I would have to learn and “cope” with this feeling.
How can You cope when the motivation, the joy, the charisma, the energy, even the basic feeling of reality is being taken away from You.
I feel worthless, like a big lump of fat, junk food, nicotine and all the shit that comes into my body. 
I can’t be persistent in things like working out, yoga and meditation as one day i just wake up and say “fuck it”.
The idea of taking my own life seems more appropriate every day.
Why not? Why not because I am afraid to live, I am afraid to have fun, every day I am accompanied by feelings of depersonalization and derealization, on each step I question reality, most of the time I just zone out.
Even suicide starts seeming not an answer because I cannot believe the notion that everything will be over, peaceful and loving on the other side. Everyday I feel like this, how could I cope with sudden feelings of relief and hapiness. It even becomes as a place of comfort - feeling depressed, angry, worthless.
The idea of everything being ok and that my brain would just forget all this stuff I went through. 
Would I feel happy if I got relief? Probably not as the traumatic experience would remind of itself in my memory, keeping me from living my life.
Everyday I spend hours searching for an answer in neurobiology, genetics, spirituality, psychology with no help as I still feel as an observer watching myself trying to crawl out of an ever growing blackhole."

depression,Desperate for drive but emotional fatigue is always winning,"I wish I could elaborate the exact words to my mental state, I feel and know deep down I am losing the battle against my mind again. Because of my physical and mental health, I'm currently not working, and the guilt I feel from relying solely on my partner worries me that I'm dragging him further down. He has more than assured me that is far from the case and wants to help me through my grief and trauma. 
I'm still so very empty without autonomy or routine.
Always exhausted or always restless.
I keep hoping for more to life than being boxed inside and losing the will or drive. Waiting for him to get off work. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting.
I used to be so patient, but I feel so chronically alone with my headspace and thoughts. It's dehabilitating."
depression,Fatigue/tired,"The ultimate main symptom of any of my mental health issues is fatigue or being tired.
It can be physical, but mostly mental.
I feel so incredibly guilty when I’m tired on my days off from work, or even after a shorter shift.
I like to sleep, it’s like a relief, or break from anything going on in my head.
There are people who don’t understand though, they’re just like “how can you be so tired when you haven’t done anything”
And it makes me feel horrible, I know it’s probably not intended to make me feel that way, but I know there are people out there who work so hard and can barely rest, where I’m always just tired.
I wish I could say to people “I would explain to you why I’m so tired, but I cannot even explain it to myself”.
I’m sorry. 😞😞"

i hate how lazy i am. i hate how i can barely focus and process information. i hate the obsessing over every negative in my life. i hate sleeping because i have no motivation to do anything else. i hate the random crying episodes. i hate the numbness. i hate it all.

i internalize everything i feel when i’m depressed, as if i’m doing this purposely, i just feel so much shame. i feel so weak and pathetic. i know it’s not my fault, but seeing myself in the mirror after a day of laying in bed and just sleeping and not having changed clothes in days or brushed my hair, i just feel so much hatred for myself for getting to this point, i’m so mad at myself for struggling."

But for months now, I feel sad in general all the time. Especially if I'm not doing anything, my mind wanders and in the end i always end up thinking how i have had a shit school life. I had good friends there but i still felt left out on the fringes.i have been bullied a few times, not alot. I havent had a girlfriend cuz i ended up being friendzoned each time. And then everyone says I'm such a nice guy n they wud like to b frnds. I know its not that big a deal. I know its not the only thing my life should b about. But thats the worst part. I know all that n how theres so much to it then just girlfriends n sex, but i still cant help being bummed out about it. Since a couple of months, i have ended up crying about it multiple times n i dont know what to do about it. I know it shouldnt be this big a deal. But the lack of a social life, lack of validation n acceptance has got to my head so much now and I cant help it. Its just too much."

All I could say was ""Well Ill be dead so I wont really feel anything "" and laughed a little bit. More like a stress laugh.



And he comented on how I think Im funny and to stop laughing. 


Idk if that is how he show affection and trying to stop me from killing my self or the contrary. But in multiple occasions he has heard of people killing themselves has called them coward peace of shits worth nothing who dont have an ouce of intelligence and that killing your self is for the weak and does good on the world weeding out weaklings.

None of my therapists ever tried to understand what I was going through. I feel so lonely n broken."
depression,Why therapy is a useless joke to me.,"Less than useless, even. It is actually damaging. It forces me to think about and dwell on all my problems in depth at least once a week, with no real solutions being offered. It is also nothing more than a cold business transaction. I pay the therapist for an hour of their time to serve as nothing more than a glorified sounding board. I don’t desire a personal relationship with my therapist,  just as they don’t desire one with me or any of their dozens of other patients going through dire circumstances. That’s why, to me, just one good friend is worth a million therapists. Someone willing to actively listen to you and offer feedback (when asked) is far more priceless and helpful than any of the so-called ‘experts’ who charge $150 or more for fifty whole minutes of their time. Unfortunately, they are as rare as they are valuable these days. Haven’t had a good friend for over a decade."

One moment I have a more or less fine mood, then suddenly I get sick with the need to throw up and I feel like I want to die. My whole family is making the whole situation worse. They assure that they make me feel like an ungrateful pos every day. It's like their mission to ruin my mood and every single day in my life. They don't care about my feelings and happiness just want to force their visions, wills etc on me. They are egoistic and narcissistic. I'm exhausted both physically and mentally and I can't cope any longer with any of these. I can't afford to somehow move away and try to get my life together. I feel like I'll always stay in this toxic environment no matter what I do. I legit feel like suicide is the only option. I  just can't.

I don't have motivation anymore to do anything. Things that used to give me excitement and entertainment before don't excite me as much anymore. I used to binge shows and watch movies and read books a lot in school and like a year after high school. I don't have the motivation to those things anymore. When I do, it's just to take my mind temporarily off worrying about my life. I'm constantly distracted by my feelings of guilt. I've disappointed my mother so much these past years and I can do nothing about it. I feel so helpless.

Tbh I don't even know if I have depression. I'm not diagnosed or anything. There's this voice in my head that keeps telling me there's nothing wrong with me mentally and that I'm just trying to blame something else for being a failure.

depression,Question on Effexor WD,"28, Male, 146lbs, 
Other medications include Kolonopin (1.5mg), Remeron (30mg), and Provigil 100mg. 



I recently switched from 225mg Effexor to Prozac, prior to that was lexapro. 

Effexor seemed to have an effect but caused me migraines that exceeded anything I had ever experienced before. 

My psych told me to taper down 75mg a week, but unfortunately I’m uninsured and would rather not pay another $30. 

I’m no stranger to WD (Benzos and alcohol) and I can’t imagine it being that bad, but what can I expect? I’m day 2 completely off, yesterday I was struggling to sleep and felt extremely uncomfortable. Today I’ve been achey, slight flu like symptoms, and no chance of sleep.

I was really putting my body through hell, being more active than usual and eating less and less, just caring about losing weight…now I am trying to maintain, I’m eating more regularly than I have in ages and I am going back to work…I just feel so guilty for the hell I probably put my boyfriend and family through…they worry about me all the time and I just feel so ashamed for allowing myself to slip further like I did…hardly talking to my boyfriend like I used to and my dear friends…

I feel depressed as hell tonight now thinking of all this…Self harm urges are back, my cat died and it caused a bit more of the downward spiral (in hindsight) and this month (September) is a year since a family friend killed himself and honestly it should have been me, not him. I just reflect on everything “bad” thats happened this whole year with my gastric issues and anorexia and just feel like a dark cloud that should be out of everyone’s lives."

depression,I tried to get help and I guess the universe doesn’t want that?,"So the other day I got so upset and cried for the first time since November and decided I would fully be willing to speak to someone about my depression and actually do something for once. In recent months I’ve started eaten a lot less, even going about 48hrs without food. My mum became concerned and told me I’d need to speak to a doctor because I kept telling her I was fine. However that never happened so I guess she was just bluffing. Because I can’t communicate any of this to my mum as I find it so awkward, I called her boyfriend and asked him to speak to my mum about an appointment for me. Then about 2 or 3 days later he called me back to say, if it was about physical health then I need to consider if it’s so serious that it requires a visit to the doctor in the country’s current climate, what with Covid and all, and if it’s a psychological thing I should avoid the doctor as it could be a hindrance to getting certain jobs in future, should a job require a health check. So I have baso concluded that this is a sign from the universe that after about 4 years of depression, I can carry on a bit longer without doing anything about it, seeing as the one time I tried, I basically got discouraged. :/

Tl, Dr: Was going to get an appointment about my depression for the first time. Baso got told if I want a job in future, it isn’t worth visiting a doctor and getting a diagnosis on my medical records. So now I’m back to pretending to be good."

I have 0 friends. My family doesn't understand and I'm not close with them. I've never been close to being in a relationship. Honestly I see myself being forever alone. I have nothing to live for. Nothing to look forward to. 

Something is just off about me. And its clear if God exists he doesnt care. So that means if there is an afterlife it wont be good either. I mean hopefully it's pure void but wasnt I in the void before I was born. Somehow I showed up here so why wont it happen again?

Life makes no fucking sense and everyday I get do see people who are in love , good job , good friends , good social skills, many non mentally ill people , people who got it better off. Sure I dont have it the worst and most people think I over exaggerate. But having wanted to brutally kill myself many times and being close I dont think is over exaggerating.

One who lives with depression or symptoms is already happy to have the possibility to share it and thats how this sub is really great and helpful. However, I think it can improve.

Personally why I think it is the case, is the lack of strength and lack of will to elaborate further. There is enough gratification writing down thoughts as they come.

However, from personal and other's experience I could recommend to elaborate further on the situation. So answers can be more targeted towards one's individual life and it is easier for people to sympathise. Never know one might find a friend..."
depression,Trying to help my husband,"First time posting. I hope it's the right sub for this. 

My husband, while not diagnosed, shows a lot of symptoms compatible with depression/anxiety and is also on medication. He was raised by narcissistic parents and, sadly, we still live under their roof until we have enough funds to find a place. They're not physically violent, but they're manipulative/emotionally abusive in a passive manner. Thankfully, he is aware of this and a lot of the tactics they use, but he's still dealing with wounds from being treated this way since childhood, it's not easy to heal, I was raised by horrible people too and I understand how it is.

However, he and I are different. When I am feeling unwell, I speak up, look for people to talk to or vent in a journal. He, on the other hand, withdraws from everyone and starts beating himself up over everything. It's heartbreaking, because he's a good guy and recently landed a decent job with a person that chose him to form and help become a professional... yet he can not see his accomplisments (claims that his professor chose him out of pity, for example). During these episodes, he says a lot of horrible things about himself, praises his abusive parents... it's like self-harm, but in an emotional manner. And there's no way to talk him out of it. Everything I try to say, he counters with something negative... even lashes out at me at times wth a hurtful sentence or two (which I learned not to take to heart because it's mostly his demons speaking). He wants to be left alone to boil in his own venom and has told me that me staying there does not actually help, but makes it worse. 

During his free time, we used to play games and chill. Now he does not feel like doing anything because he considers the weekend as ""dead time before work"". He overthinks about work and ""achieving results"" (something his manager of father used to say, that ""I don't care about how you do things, I only want to see results""). He compares himself with his teacher and other people, beats himself up over mistakes at the job (he's learning, you're meant to make mistakes in programming, even his senior of a professor messes up!) and is lately unable to relax. 

I don't know what to do to help him, as he rejects my attempts. I am concerned about his wellbeing and I am also under a lot of anxiety myself. I do have a bad trait of unconsciously absorbing all the stress of the home like a sponge... and it's exhausting. I wanted to reach out to you people and ask for some advice, and also ask you if you yourself are like this and prefer to deal with things alone. I need some guidance."
depression,Diagnosed with NPD,What the hell am I supposed to do now? The doctor who diagnosed me says I need a specialist but can't recommend anyone so I can't even get professional support. Everywhere I search about NPD and personality disorders it's people taking about how horrible and violent and abusive people with personality disorders. I saw reddit posts telling people that if they know someone with a personality disorder they should run the other way immediately because there's no hope for them and they'll always hurt you. There's posts talking about people with NPD being evil. Am I going to be like that? Is that all I can ever be? Should I just die?

depression,15-25 has been the hardest ten years of my life,"Basically what the title says. If it has been this f\*cking torturous for this long, and life just keeps getting more complex and difficult to deal wth, I shudder to think of the depression I could be facing ten or twenty years from now."
depression,My mind is completely broken,"I was born wounded, and circumstances kept making things worse. That's been most of my 35+ years.

I genuinely tried everything, 10+ antidepressants, multiple therapies, and they had one of two effects: 1) nothing at all, 2) destroyed me. The last antidepressant I took literally wiped my mind clean, it seems like a nuclear bomb went off in my head: I have no thoughts at all, my mind is just blank/black/empty all the time. Things literally went from very bad to absolute hell. I don't want anything, I don't like anything, I don't love anything, I don't have any friends. Everything is meaningless and useless in life. I can't even talk to anyone about it. I live in a state of permanent confusion. No idea why I'm writing in here, just have to do it.  If you know any psychologists in London who are familiar with this sort of condition, pls let me know. Perhaps there's someone out there who can help me.   

When I say broken I mean completely broken: it's twisted to the extent I don't feel drunk even after a bottle of vodka, I don't feel any compassion or warmth, or anything like those tiny little bits of something human that used to be available to me before. I'm like a robot, it's literally a piece of metal in my head instead of a brain."
depression,Considering medication/fear making up depression,"(Tw: mentions of suicidality and self-harm)

TLDR: I have depression and don’t know what to do about it. I also fear I may be faking it. Any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hi all,

Sorry to take up some of your day. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety three years ago. I have times where I’m what I call ‘fully’ depressed, and can’t do anything. I feel absolutely awful, and like my mind is lead. Thankfully, these times aren’t overly frequent anymore; I just have a few days every couple of weeks where I’m in that state. Most of the time, I’m just mentally exhausted and just kind of numb? I don’t know how to describe it. I’m not actively unhappy, but I’m certainly not happy. I just... exist. I’m too tired to meet friends or to go out, but I’m not ‘fully’ depressed, just disconnected. If I were to push myself to go out etc, I will then probably become ‘fully’ depressed for a while (maybe for a few days), because I would be so exhausted from the activity. I also worry a lot about talking to people and their judgement (it can take me hours to write the smallest of emails). But sometimes I feel like I’m faking it all (or causing it by thinking about it too much), because I can easily act ‘happy’ (and often have to), and because I do have the odd few days or evenings where I’m okay (or good, even!). Idk.

I’m wondering what my next steps should be. I don’t like looking far into the future, as I’m not sure I want to be there (not to sound too grim, sorry), however, I feel like I need to do *something*. I don’t want to just keep existing like this and wasting my life. 

In the past I have been in therapy for short-ish periods of time. It helped me get to where I am now (I was ‘fully’ depressed for quite a long time, and suicidal/self-harming). However, I never really felt like it was a ‘cure’ - though I know looking for a ‘cure’ is probably, ironically, over-optimistic. Nonetheless, I am trying to get teletherapy through the NHS - but I don’t have much hope for it, as I feel even more disconnected when on the phone. (Also, I live at home, so privacy is an issue with this form of therapy.)

I have looked into SSRIs, and they terrify me. There are such scary stories about their side effects (weight gain, worsening depression/anxiety, and an increased inability to concentrate scare me the most), and the issues when coming *off* them seem grim too. Also, because I have periods of being ok (and *sometimes* good, even), I’m scared I’m just being over dramatic, and don’t need them. Also, I may start work soon, and need to learn to drive as soon as I can, and am scared about the meds preventing that. And my family are very anti-medication, so I would have to hide this from them. Finally, I am going through a lot of changes right now (aren’t we all?) with moving, graduating, and job-hunting, and I fear that it may not be the best time to make any big decisions, idk.

I have read many self-help books, tried yoga and mediation, tried exercise and a ‘healthy diet’. Nothing changed. 

Any thoughts, stories, and/or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance."

depression,I might have cancer,"I used to have such bad health anxiety. But also a problem binge drinking. Did so for 3 years. I think it finally caught up with me. 

I found a lump under my chin. Got all the check marks of cancer. Hard, non moving, painless. 

This could finally be my way out of life... I didn't think it would happen so soon. 

If I'm fine then that would obviously be preferable but... I don't know. I'm scared but excited at the same time. Maybe I'm finally going to die."

depression,Depression ruined my marriage,"Together 5 years, married 2. She left me 3 months ago. I'm (32M), she's (30F)

Long story, but I knew from the beginning she struggled with GAD and was on medication for it. I never knew the extent of it and that she also dealt with depression until recently. She was on 3 different prescription meds, one with a. Dosage twice the FDA limit. She told me back in February that she was depressed and felt it was our marriage. She couldn't pinpoint the reason but basically said she didn't feel the spark anymore and was bored. This led her to have an Emotional affair and lash out at me when I confronted her about it. This turned into her saying she hadn't been in love with me since we got married and she wasn't cut out for marriage. She left but has been in contact pretty regularly - sometimes about nothing and sometimes we talk about us. She's made it clear she has no feelings left for me. However, she did admit she's still really depressed, hasn't found a new psych, and doesn't understand what's wrong with her. I tried explaining that depression could have made her stop enjoying life and getting bored with out marriage, but it didn't go anywhere. She's told me many times I did nothing wrong, I was a great person and husband, and I deserve someone better. She doesn't understand why it wasn't enough for her and she just needs to be alone for figure her stuff out.

I know there is little chance that she comes back and I've still told her I'm here if she needs any support. She has no friends, no hobbies besides exercising, and she said she hasn't been going out or anything since she moved out. Not sure if there's anything left I can do to help her. She said finding a new therapist is on her to-do list, but she hasn't done that in 3 months.

Of course i don't want to lose her but I also want her to find happiness."
depression,I woke up again...,"And again I just keep doing absolutely nothing, wasting hours of my life just watching YouTube videos. Every year that passes I'm doing worst academically and it just got to the point that I don't even care anymore if I fail my clases because I just want to do nothing. I go to sleep hoping to not wake up the next day just to be disappointed and keep on this toxic cycle. I don't know what to do anymore I just feel like I'm a waste of space that has no future. My sleeping schedule has gone to hell at this point and I've been feeling worst because of it. I just want to stop feeling like trash I just want to be happy again. I play sometimes with my friends to free my mind but after they're gone I'm just left alone with this depressing thoughts and I know I can't keep doing this to myself I know I need to change but... How? Why can't I just stop being so pathetic? Do I even have a good future ahead at this point? I lie to the people around me saying that I'm doing great and I feel like shit because of it but I can't stop. Im so tired every day and I do absolutely nothing all day, but still I'm so tired... I'm too tired."

depression,Overwhelmed,"I feel so overwhelmed. I just had a meltdown on my living room floor because I have to go out and buy some rear view mirror glue from AutoZone. I was on my knees, face in my hands, sobbing. Why is this so overwhelming for me? When did life become so hard? When did it get so bad? Why can’t I bring myself to do the things I know will make me feel better? 

I can’t bring myself to do the things that I have to do. I can’t find motivation to work. I can’t find the motivation to do homework. In the last 5 weeks all I have been able to do is write an introductory discussion for school. I’m ruining my life and my future. I want to get better but I don’t have insurance and I can’t afford therapy. I’m so lost and tired. I just want to be hopeful again.

depression,it’s getting bad again,"i was not diagnosed with depression and i never went to a psychiatrist but i don’t know where else to post or who to talk to... i just have to get this out..
It’s getting really bad again and for like 6 months i thought i was doing better but it’s all coming back.
I feel empty, sad in pain i can’t even describe it. I can’t eat and now i have trouble sleeping(usually when i was feeling this way i was sleeping all the time but now i can’t even fall asleep because as soon as i close my eyes i fell like i’m gonna go crazy and i get very nauseus and i feel my body getting hot and i can’t breathe) i’m a big overthinker and it’s really bad. Because of stress and the pain i can’t even eat, i just think of food and i have a feeling i’m gonna throw up. I feel nauseus all the time and i just want to cry. I don’t know how i was coping with those feelings before it’s like memories of those times just went away. I don’t know what to do anymore i’m just tired of everything."
depression,How do I know antidepressant ever really worked? After 1.5 years? Please help,"I’ve been on Zoloft for depression, and general + social anxiety for over 1.5 years. I’ve basically been on 200mg daily for most of that time. I’m honestly not sure I have ever “felt different” or “better” since starting Zoloft. I did take Aplenzin (basically Wellbutrin) in addition to Zoloft for about 6 months earlier this year, but ultimately stopped due to the cost/insurance issues. I am not sure how one feels when medication “works” ... But I don’t feel that Zoloft has really improved my issues...I know lately I have been feeling fucking AWFUL (job change..anxiety and self-hatred is at an all time high).   I was also seeing a therapist weekly, but I don’t have insurance for a while due to my job change and can’t afford out of pocket pay.   I feel very lost and alone and I absolutely hate the way I feel about myself, life. I don’t get out of bed and I cannot stop hating myself."

depression,A failing marriage,"I (24f) have been married to my partner(36m) for a but over a year and im not sure i love him anymore.   Three months before our wedding he changed a bit. I thought it was stress.  He dsnt really hang out with me anymore and alot of the stuff we used to do together we dont anymore.  He dsnt do alot around the house either.  He mostly just games, works, or sleeps.  Iv been struggling really hard and had a recent attempt and ended up doing a partial hospitalization program.  He hadnt even noticed i was spiraling.  When i try to talk to him he dsnt know wat to do or say.  It doesnt help.  So when that happend he was upset that my bff(27m)  knew alot more than him. Around this time things got more complicated as well. My bff is also my roomate and i have a slight crush on him.  It makes me feel guilty and disgusting because i want to feel these feelings for my partner but i cant seem to anymore. And i also dont want feelings for my bff, its confusing.  My bff has been very supportive of me.  He notices when im having a hard time and always puts in an effort to cheer me up. My husband barely looks at me unless he is tryna get in my pants.  I dont know how to fix my marriage.  We literally bought a house together and have 5 cats together.   Iv been really struggling with depression these last 3 weeks and its getting harder everyday.  I just want to feel loved."

depression,I don’t really know what’s happening,"So I guess I’m not diagnosed with depression but I’m sure I have it, or had idk. Anyway a couple weeks ago I got a girlfriend and it’s made me kinda like feel again, but in a very strange way, almost like a limbo state definitely not myself like I was like 5 years ago but not super depressed Either just a strange limbo state and I guess what I am asking is has anybody else had this kinda feeling? I just want help."
depression,It's been two years since I've last posted here and nothing has gotten better,"I'm 14 now. It's been so hard these last few months.

I've gotten in many altercations with my parents. They make me feel really bad about myself sometimes. They say they want the best for me but then proceed to physically hit me multiple times and downplay my wins.

I understand that I can constantly improve, but I don't see why they only focus on my negatives.

My high school that I'm going to be attending has two schooling options: independent study or online class learning. I told my parents that I would specifically like doing independent study so that I can work at my own pace and have more freedom. However, without even telling me, they had already signed me up for online classes.

They told me that I wasn't responsible enough, I can't even take showers when I'm told (even though you're scientifically not even supposed to every day), I won't be able to do it because I'm gonna get stuck at one point and need help, etc.

They always point out my flaws and don't ever make me feel better about them. I get like one pimple a month and they're always saying it makes me ugly and stuff like that. And then they basically pin me down to pop it. (EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.)

They essentially think I'm stupid or ""have no structure in my life."" It's also like they don't realize I'm at the top of my class and have essentially had perfect attendance since fifth grade... It's just like they don't even realize the positives about me.

My parents are always telling me to respect them and they can't even do the same to me. They think it's a double standard because ""they're the adults and I'm the kid."" I do love them, but sometimes I just don't know...

There are other things going on in my life too that make me feel really down. Like, one of my friends gets a lot of what he wants when he asks his parents. I know parents shouldn't just buy everything you want, but he even has his own credit card. And to my knowledge, it always seems like he gets $20 fairly often. I'm lucky if I get that amount of money in a year.

I'm very aware that I should not get everything I want, and maybe my friend is an extreme example. But whenever I ask my parents for something, they like to guilt trip me. I'll ask for something and then they'll bring up how I accidentally broke a mirror when I was like 7 or something. And how I can't even respect my stuff or them.

I feel as if I should just be happy with the essentials they provide me. They provide me with even more. This post might even make me seem spoiled (because it's somewhat true, I mean, some of these are the most First World problems). I think it's their mental (and sometimes) physical abuse towards me that makes me realize that they are not providing the safest and most logical way to ""teach me.""

It's honestly just so unfair that people like me are born in poorer families. I know my parents try their best, but in the end I never asked to be born. And sometimes I never wanted to be."
depression,Rant ig,"I’m tired. 

I’m being crept on by thoughts of my abusive ex, how she emotionally manipulated and abused me, how she would sometimes physically hurt me, how she said she loved me and left me multiple times just to keep me there on her strings. 

What if she didn’t love me, what if no one does. They all just act like it. 

I’m never the first person people think of. Everyone hangs out and I’m just here depressed. My friends tell me all of the fun they had with plans I was supposed to be included on.

My parents may or may not have lied. Both of them would say the other did wrong and then the other would say they’re wrong and would tell me bad things they did to me. 

I don’t wanna trust anyone, the more I do the more I’ll get hurt.

I don’t know what to say anymore on this. I feel like there’s so much, but I can’t accumulate the words. 

Whether it be a bullet or 19 shots of tequila, I’ll forget the pain.

Hopefully someone will show me the love and affection I need to feel better. 

My mental health isn’t ever going to get better. 

I’ve planned my future too many times to want to actually want to even have a future anymore. 

I’m tired"

My sleep schedule is all off right now which is a huge depression trigger for me. On top of that, I have MDD with mixed features. My lows are LOW, and I think I’m falling into that right now. 

I hit a wall yesterday. Someone I knew from high so is the kind of person who is never single and has been engaged about 4 times. She just got engaged to her newest guy and it made something snap. I just felt... empty. 

I was doing better today until I laid down to go to bed. The only person who ever said they loved me was one of the shittiest people I’ve ever met, and that was pushing 10 years ago. I’ll be 28 soon, and I feel like there’s something wrong with me. 

I don’t think I’m necessarily even upset about like “oh, I don’t have a boyfriend, waaaah”. It’s more I want someone to actually want to be with me and love me."

depression,Talking to myself,"Life feels like a party I ended up at because a friend drove me there without asking. I don't know anyone. I want to, but the faces and body language say there's no room. Small talk is painful but I'm afraid to open up to anything deeper despite how badly I want it. I know it's pointless to ask for reciprocity. People either will or they won't. When someone forgets my name while I remember their favorite movie from our first conversation, I die a little inside.

I struggle to trust, but when I do, I trust the wrong people. Every burst of emotion that escapes I want to take back the moment it slips out. The more people know about me the less comfortable I feel. I want to disappear, go far away where no one knows me, but eventually the loneliness will catch up with me again. My problems feel insignificant. It's pathetic to turn over a single meaningless interaction in my head until I'm sick of existing but I can't help it. 

What is it like to live without ghosts dragging you down? At least people can see a broken arm. When your brain is broken it doesn't compute. Shape up. You're fine. I want to be okay by myself, but I can't stop hoping that this time will be different, and I'll have that moment that lets me tell someone else with confidence later on that it gets better.

I'm afraid of being someone who knows that it won't."

I love her and she could be my one and only reason to live, but there are a couple more reasons to be death, my past cannot be fixed and my personality, my life is destroyed. I don't want to pollute her with all of this but im not strong enough to leave her in both ways, I don't want to hurt her or make her feel sad. I love her and i should be happy but im not, its even more painful, but at least its a double edge weapon.

depression,Why do I always fail?,"So, my whole life I've never quite fit in, I've been very misunderstood. I was always weird, but until my late teens, I was very kind.

I was very kind, but I got bullied and humiliated in front of people all the time. At school, at work. People just didn't like me. Maybe the combination of me being weird (which probably made me unlikable) and being nice (which made me an easy target.)

I even tried to fit in. I've always tried, but in Highschool I tried REALLY hard. Still, every part of me was picked apart. How I talked, how I walked, every single flaw in my looks from head to toe.


This even happened in public. I went to a New Year's gathering, and while everyone was saying ""Happy New Year's"" to each other, I tried and everyone ignored me. I even made tried with someone who had just congratulated someone else. I made eye contact, smiled and said ""Happy New Year's!"" And they looked at me for a second, but then sort of looked ahead of me to and ignored me. Not even their expression changed.

I noticed that all the people that bullied me and ignored me had friends. They would make a joke about me in front of the whole room, and everyone would laugh or just awkwardly stay quiet.

Well, by 18, I had become sick of this. So everytime someone tried to bully me at school, I bullied them back. I cursed them, called them fat, ugly, stupid pieces of shit, etc.

And guess what happened? I got in trouble with teachers, and people started calling me ""mean, rude, and a bitch.""

So, people can criticize me and pick me apart, to the point where I developed bipolar because I cried every night, and was just fucked with throughout the years.

When the ""bullies"" said shit to me, and treated me badly, people would laugh, and teachers would ignore it.

But when I started fighting back, I became the ""bad guy"" ""the bully"" and got scolded by the teachers.

Well now, I'm out of school. And I'm nice to everyone who's nice to me, and insult anyone who treats me like shit.

But again, when I defend myself by insulting them back, I'm ""rude, mean, sensitive, too angry"" etc. But the people who put me down are never in the wrong.

Because they're more ""likeable"" and probably because in all honesty they're more attractive. I look like shit.


So if I'm nice and let people walk all over me, hold in my feelings, and cry into my pillow at night I fail.

When I fight back, I fail.

Was I just born to be hated and shit on by everyone forever?"
depression,Am I dead?,"When does a person die actually. Is it when our soul manages to escape from our bodies or when we loose the will to live. Ever since I did wrong by someone I love, I don't feel good. It's almost been more than a year and all I can think of is how badly I treated them. Since that time I've been trying to numb myself with weed and alcohol. I've dropped outta college and my future doesn't promise much other than failure. I often think of doing the obvious but I'm not strong enough to do so. Everyday it feels like a heavy object is weighing me down. I can't talk about this with anyone (not much of an extrovert). I have no ambition and all that I used to be is lost within myself. I wake up with an heavy heart and I passout drunk and stoned. Many a times I think to myself I should start living again. So as of now am I alive or am I dead."

depression,Anhedonia is Back,"I was suffering from major anhedonia from about August of last year to around June of this year. I was so glad to be free from that. Other than my lack of tase (which we think is something else), I was back to normal.
School is starting next week. I’m doing college applications. I have 3 online classes to finish within the week. And I just don’t care at all. Things I used to like doing I don’t get enjoyment out of anymore. TV shows or videos I usually loved to watch I just listen to for background noises.
I feel as if I’m in an endless cycle of me being really depressed, getting a quick moment of relief, then going down into the spiral again."

My emotions and issues and trauma and things I see, hear and feel, all sit in my mind eating it away driving me slowly to the brink of insanity. Then I proceed to freak out like I did last night, and it all goes to the back of my head again for about 4 months or fewer than I have another one. I know that when you say you can't it psychs you out of it but I can't think of a word that would describe better than can't, I just don't know what to do at this point and most of my friends tell me I should keep my issues to my self, etc. but I don't know where else to go so I hope someone can at least relate to me."

depression,Going through it bad.,"I have clinical depression. My meds are good but I’m concerned about running out since losing my health insurance. Right now with the pandemic. Job loss. Unemployment being denied. Pandemic moratorium on evictions ending. Worrying about my kid going to school. Being on a ridiculously bad sleep schedule. Just everything. I’m feeling suicidal. The hotlines feel weird. It’s my nature to be jovial on the phone. I’ve been told they really should let me go so they can talk to people who are feeling bad. As soon as we hang up I feel non-jovial again. So maybe my issue is being so lonely. When I lost my job I lost my social life, so to speak. Nobody has contacted me since I was let go at the end of June. I’d been there more than 5 years. That fucking hurts too. 

I haven’t made a plan. I know my kid would be alone in the world without me.

depression,My best and only friend is being distant and I'm at the lowest I have been in years.,"Let me give you a sense of our relationship. We met in high school. We went to different schools but always saw each other on the weekends. We had a mutual best friend who passed away a few years ago. I would always invite him to our band practice. Practice couldnt start without this guy. The fallout was so intense I went crazy. I had to live with him at his parents for a year. We would smoke and drink together and talk about music.

We've been through changes and always kept in touch. Its been about 12 years.

Recently he has been making plans with me only to tell me that he's going camping or to the beach with someone else at last minute. He even used to talk about how he didnt like those people. He hangs out with them at every chance and I am rarely invited or considered. If we make plans, he cancels them the day of sometimes to hang out with someone else.

Recently I bought him a very expensive birthday gift, and in return he gave me a gift as well, a very nice guitar he had lying around. It sounds fantastic.

I sent him something tonight and he just responded with a picture of a campfire. I think he is trying to tell me that he is moving on from our relationship, but he doesnt want me to be hurt.

Should I just stop texting him?

Another thing is. His girlfriend (who he lives with) is attracted to me and Im attracted to her. There is enough there to make him uncomfortable, especially when we've all been drinking. I think that puts a heavy strain on our friendship.

I'm posting this here because I am at such a depressive low that I can't do anything but lay in bed. He is the last person left who understands me, but I think I need to move on and find new friends."
depression,The magic number 25,"I've met a lot of people over the years and they all seem to say that by age 25+ is when they need to have their life together. They have to be living on their own, be already working in their career, and some say that's when they already want to have a significant other or be married by then. Yet, even though i know this is not very realistic my mind still subconsciously believes i need to be ""perfect"" by then. I have met people  22/23  years old telling me they feel like failures because they're still in community college and single as they down a bottle of alcohol. I'm only 21 but people have already started called me old, and when i hear that i start to think what i've done with my life. Then the horrible things that have happened to me over the years start flowing in. I spend days and weeks so unmotivated that i can't even lift up my paint brush or instrument. The only thing that forces me out of bed is my job, because if i don't go then i'll be broke. I don't want this time limit but society and especially my family seems to be forcing it on me."

depression,Who is your reason for staying??,"The one and only reason that I am still in this world is my best friend, I met him by chance and there was virtually no possibility we should have been friends, but against the odds we became close. He was the first person I ever told about being suicidal and the same night he called me and stayed on call long after I fell asleep. A few months ago he called an ambulance for me and saved my life.

depression,Here to help,[removed]
depression,what do I do?!! I’m losing my mind (this is long),"long story...
so I decided I wanted to end my three year relationship. It was like reliving the same episode of a show every day. I worked with him, went to school with him, and hung out with him every single day. I decided to end the relationship about two weeks after our three year anniversary after our high school graduation. 
Prior to the end of the relationship in June, in April, I started talking to a friend I met in school who was a year older than me. He lived far away across the country but we became very close friends. I helped him through the end of his long distance relationship of a year. We FaceTimed every single night in April. I started to catch feelings and it was scary to me, but I was making it obvious to him that I had feelings. So he became uncomfortable with talking once I told him I had feelings. I didn’t know what to do with myself, I lost 10lbs over the course of a week, and I was highly considering ending my relationship over even having thought of another person on a highly emotional and romantic level. 
But we stopped talking and I resumed my life with my boyfriend again. It wasn’t the same though and I wasn’t happy. 
Slowly but surely, over the course of May, my old friend came around and we started talking again as friends, but not on a close level. He swiped up on my Snapchat story and every time it would still give me butterflies, but I didn’t think twice about it. He told me he was coming back home permanently to where I live (and he grew up here too before he moved). I was so excited to see him, even if we just were friends. 
So I hadn’t updated him on anything over June really, but I was starting to become infatuated with another person again. I had anxiety issues and the fact that I was infatuated over ANOTHER person AGAIN drove me insane. Although, it was enough to convince me I wasn’t happy in my relationship. So I decided it was going to come to an end. 
I FaceTimed my old friend, and told him what was going on with my life and he told me what I was doing was going to be best for myself but I shouldn’t continue to be with the person I was infatuated with. This was because he knew the other guy and knew he was a toxic person. One night later, my friend flew home the midnight after my breakup. 
I saw him the next evening, where we hung out for an entire 24 hours straight. Actually, 48 almost. We could not be separated. I realized that I had no mourning over the end of my last relationship and this was the person I wanted to truly be with. So we started dating the fifth day he was home in town. 
Up until around the 20th of July I lived in pure bliss. Then, he started working and becoming more and more distant at the drop of a hat. I question every single day if he wants to be with me. He’s so wrapped up in the fact that his career failed because of his previous relationship. He’s lost in his head all the time, when I’m with him, it feels like we’re alone. I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid that I’m gonna end up just like I did before where he cut me off in April but this time it’ll be worse. Because this was all I ever wanted and now I’m highly emotionally involved. I get criticized for handling situations with such high emotion. He doesn’t truly open up to me about his feelings, and when I try to get him to, he pushes me away. All I want is to be loved back. All I want is to feel wanted again. And now whenever I see him, it turns to shit. I cry every day, I have anxiety attacks every week. But I want to keep trying so bad because if I end this relationship that means I’ll need a ton of time to recover and I want to know if this is worth saving. I’m driving myself into the ground. god please someone help me with this"

depression,I just woke up crying again,"I can't handle this anymore, the lack of sleep I am getting daily is killing me. The constant reminders of her and the stress that comes with it. I don't know who to talk to or what to do anymore, These same 4 fucking walls are driving me crazy. Why me? Why do I have to be so sad all the time? Do things get better? Easier? Why doesn't anyone answer me? Can you even hear me?"

depression,I have a feeling a lot of self proclaimed depressed people aren't really depressed.,"Disclaimer first. Whenever someone tells me they feel depressed I take it seriously no matter what. It's better to take it seriously rather than to leave a person to its own thoughts. BUT

I see posts/comments on social media like 'due to my depression I can't...' I find this really weird since you are limiting yourself options to eventually get over the depression. People seem to use depression as an excuse not to work on themselves.

I also think people make the fact that they have depression a personality trait. Maybe it has to do with that?

Now if I look at the symptoms of various depressions. I fit some of them as well. Although I don't claim to have depression. The main one is that life seems long in my eyes. But I keep telling myself I'm good to go. I find happiness in smaller things in life. Sometimes it gets harder and I stay in bed almost the entire day, but I refuse to admit I have depression.

Can someone please share their thoughts about this with me. I don't want to think a lot of people just use the term 'depression' inappropriately.

Ps: I lost my aunt to depression. It's a complicated mental illness I want to learn more about to be more emphatic."
depression,Worthless failure,"Does anyone else ever just go on social media and see all the people you've grown up with accomplishing their goals, buying their own house, getting in relationships, and just being generally happy? And then realize that you have had the same amount of time and the same chances to do something with yourself but you've wasted it all doing nothing not making friends or learning to socialize.

Fuck life nothing is enjoyable and even when I feel happy it doesn't seem real it's like a lie. Keep lying to myself that things will be alright when nothing matters and i hate myself."
depression,I talk myself in circles every day and it's getting to be too much.,"I hate my job. 

We want to move. 

Here's some available jobs. They pay way less so we couldn't move. 

Here's some that pay more but we'd HAVE to move. Can't afford to move without getting a better job. Need to move to get a better job. 

Maybe I'll go to school so I COULD get a better job. 

Then we're stuck here until that is finished, and then longer so I can find a good job and recoup what was spent on school + lost wages from not working. 

Ah fuck it I guess I have to keep going to a job I despise and get shit on so that MAYBE one day we can think about leaving. MAYBE. 

I'm stuck in this stupid feedback loop and its driving me nuts. Can't plan for anything the way the world is right now. 

I quit using cannabis almost 2 months ago and was super excited about good things, now not so much. I won't go back to using, that's not who I am anymore but my god do i need a BIG change.

The stress and anxiety of every day is really taking its toll. Have to not think about it or I get so frustrated and angry, and not thinking about it doesn't solve a damn thing."

depression,There's literally no point to dating if you're depressed,"Seriously, what's the use. People look for a partner who can brighten their day and make their life more exciting. How is anyone who is severely depressed capable of any of this? People want to be with someone who has ambition and hope for the future, and I have none of that. People want to be with someone who has a decent sex drive, which I haven't had for years. People want to date someone who is sociable, clever, funny, which doesn't apply to me at all. People want to date someone who will remember details about important conversations or events, but depression has been slowly destroying my brain and memory for years. I've been reading psychology articles that say that depressed people are more likely to be low in emotional intelligence, which only further supports my view. Who on earth would want to date someone who is not only borderline suicidal but has low EQ? Besides it's not like dating someone just for cuddles and sex will magically treat my depression when meds and therapy didn't work. It's all just useless and hopeless."
depression,A Little Lovely Rant,"When your dreams all fail, when your expectations were not met 
you're disappointed 

You've no choice but to fake smile and continue with this burden of sadness

Your self esteem is trying to drag you down each time..

You see happy people all around when you open social media, you start comparing your lonely sad ass life to the fake life they are portraying on social media. You feel terrible and cry yourself to sleep..

You wish there was someone in real life who would understand you, but lack of such relation is making you feel lonelier so you go in search of love you're not getting from real life. 

You vent your feelings all over internet to feel validated because you're insecure and have no one to appreciate you..

Well this is life...A dreadful journey.  

In this heat of youthfulness you get into traps and priorities are fucked up. 

You are even forgetting the people who raised you,

Your priority for your family is at the lowest? Why?

You even don't know why you're sad, 

You don't know who you're.

You're trying to hide from everything and everyone.

Away from all sick thoughts, but pain and problems are inevitable, it starts to haunt you as soon as you wake up each day.

Fake people are pretending to be my friend and showing fake sympathy which they didnt even meant..

Well, I don't have much to say, but I wish I was happy

i haven't seen a therapist or really told anyone about it as i don't want to bother them or make them worry or i make them think im making it up for attention (i don't even know if it is normal). i do know that we have good and bad days so i think i may have my bads day but i don't know if thats how a bad day should feel like with some mini suicidal thoughts or thinking your lazy."

depression,"RONA WHO, i need to rant","EDIT: my grandma just called and expressed how mad she is haha 

So yeah I do need to rant

I spent 3,5 months alone in my dorm room in the UK, away from my friends and fam, in the lockdown due to rona
I flew back to my homeland last month and spent 14 days in quarantine just to make sure that I’m not ill

And now my boss at work went to work, and one worker as well, when they BOTH HAD FXKING SYMPTOMS. 

Guess what, our boss was tested POSITIVE FOR RONA which means that; 
1) no work=no money
2) I may have infected my parents and friends
3) all of my plans got cancelled
4) I have to spend 14 days AGAIN in quarantine
5) I can’t visit my cousins in our neighbour country and have to spend my birthday alone next week...

I am so sad and angry at the same time...
How can some people be so careless?

(furthermore: I was working temporarily in a fast food restaurant so no one has idea how many customers our restaurant infected)

This whole situation id a big F rn

depression,How to cope with depression when you’re an introvert?,"Hi,
I’ve noticed theres kind of a paradox when having depression as an introvert. On one hand, I get tired after social events (even like meeting 1on1 with a close friend), and I need time to recharge. But on the other hand, when I don’t have contact with people for some time(e.g. like a week or a few days) I slowly fall into a depression episode. I still struggle with getting myself back on track each time; but generally meeting someone and going to do something, really grounds me back into reality and help me feel better. 
Does anyone else experience this? Do you have any tips on how to ground yourself without a source of pressure from the outside?"
depression,bettering my husband and then offing myself.,"i struggle with depression and i have for so long. it's only gotten worse and now i'm stuck. i day dream about offing myself. i quit my job so now i'm a stay at home wife taking care of my step son and my husband. i feel worthless without a job so add that onto my pile. i found my husband a job where he works graveyard and yeah great woo but all those nights i'm gonna sleep alone and cry myself
to sleep without him there. some days i'm scared i'm going to finally hurt myself and call it quits. i've tried to call it quits twice. the thoughts only grow stronger and become darker each day. it doesn't get easier. i'm barely making it and when i'm trying to better myself i feel sick. my goal is to get my husband into a steady job, make sure he gets his GED, save for his own place, and once everything is settled, i'll finally do it. i don't want to live for myself. i'm not worth it. i'm here to help others, not myself. idk.... just needed to vent i guess i'm sorry"

depression,"To sleep, or not to sleep","I've made the interesting little discovery that my depression disappears if I don't sleep (Awake for more than 24h). It feels like a miracle, that I'm actually refresehed instead of tired, motivated and most of all, just happy. Being content going about my life and laughing at silly little things. I can also concentrate better, approach things a little more intelligently.

But that goes hand in hand with a loss of short term memory, a very silent white noise (not even that is bad for me, I find it fun.. others probably wouldn't) and a strange feeling like a constant electric pulse (very slight).

Sounds like drugs, right? Normally I'm very tired and sleep for 8 hours or more so I didn't know this. And apparently I'm not alone, there are studies online that tell similar tales.

Now I don't want to sleep any more. But I also don't want to get obese, get diabetes, having my skin dissolve or other horror stories that allegedly happen when you don't sleep. Man, why does it have to be bad for your body to feel good mentally? I wonder if I should just make an experiment and see what happens if I stay up a couple days/nights in a row. Something tells me that I'm being a stupid idiot, but I wanna do it."
depression,I almost became a mass murderer due to undiagnosed Body Dysmorphic Disorder,"I've recently self-diagnosed myself with BDD, and I feel like it answers so many questions that I've always had about myself, and explains so many of my issues.

The title of my post is dramatic, but I thought that there must be someone out there who this may help, as well as that I need to get it off my chest. This is how BDD wrecked havoc on my personal development in life.

Going to try to keep this pretty concise.

I'm in my early thirties, and for the past decade, almost, I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and get my life back on track.

I first started showing signs of BDD when I was around 8. I hated my face so much that I didn't want to leave my room or be seen by anyone. My parents did their best to help me, but I was convinced I was hideous. From then on, BDD related intrusive thoughts were a constant.

As I got older and entered puberty, I was already suffering from social anxiety, and a strong sense of being ""different"". I felt subhuman. I was very conscious of my appearance, and absolutely hated how I looked, but BDD also plagued my subconsciousness; it affected how I acted around and towards other people. I didn't develope the same social skills as people around me, especially with regards to the opposite sex; when a few people started dating in the 6th grade, I actually had a girl I was into, and who was into me, but I completely lacked the sense in my head to do anything about it, and she started ""dating"" another guy.

This pattern of avoidance continued through my teens, as I would see people dating and being social, and I felt like an outcast. What makes it extra painful is that I actually turned girls down, because I wanted to avoid .. being with them. It was a very difficult and confusing time for me. I felt more and more like an outcast, and at this point, my group of friends was also going down.

From the 3rd grade, I never really did homework. I can't explain what the reason was, because I come from a really great and loving family, I went to good schools and had motivated peers, but I never did homework. Again, this feeling of being different from everyone else.. I now believe that my BDD was so bad that I legitimately started thinking I actually WAS different, and that I was a monster.

I started browsing sites like 4chan, and other various slum websites, from the porn variation to the gore variation. I became fascinated by serial killers and mass murderers, like school shooters. I felt it resonated with me... I was a monster, and the idea of unleashing all the pain and confusion that had plagued my mind, onto everyone around me, was appealing. Everyday after school, when I wasn't mindlessly gaming for hours on end, I would view this filth and poison my mind further. I would harass people online, and towards the end of my teens, I was becoming a toxic person in real life too, especially towards my family.

I dreamed of suicide. I dreamed of shooting up my highschool, or doing the same downtown. All the while, I maintained a dwindling social life with a core group of friends, where I would lament my loner status, having no chance with girls, and just.. being different.

I realize my post is now very long, so I'm going to leave it at that. But, hopefully, I have shared some insight into how a mental disorder like BDD can spiral out or control, and if left unchecked, under the proper circumstances; destroy your soul.

One last thing that I want to add, after now being sure that I've properly diagnosed myself; I can't begin to describe the amount of sadness, remorse, and regret I have for having thrown so much of my life away, and the other people it affected. I'm sad that I wasn't diagnosed, and I'm sad that I became how I became. So many people I could have known, girlfriends I could have had, things I could have done and experienced.. and above all, how different my outlook on myself and my life could have been."
depression,Lack of joy,"I am 22 male. I never had a girlfriend and i even never kissed girl. 
Over two weeks ago i met a nice, inteligent girl. I asked her for date. Next day she asked me for date. On next dates i kissed her many times, i think she likes me.
But i dont feel positive emotions. I only feel pressure, fear, uncertainty. When i am kissing her i feel barely nothing.

To be honest, i dont remember when i felt happiness. I think i dont remember life without depression and avoidant personality."
depression,Any Married People Here?,Anyone else’s husband makes them feel lonely and stupid? Can’t seem to talk to him anymore.
depression,A family member with depression?,"I am seeking some like minded experiences from people who may be going through the same thing. 

I have a brother who I believe has depression. He has asked for help twice. I took him to see a physician. He was unwilling to do blood tests, go to therapy, talk about his issues, be evaluated, etc, after agreeing to the initial visit.
He refused to go to a follow up. The second time, he asked but refused to see someone again. We couldn't force him. 

He lives with my mother who is a single parent and has been for most of our lives. It is he and her at home (he is in his mid 20s). He dropped out of highschool and wouldnt hear about getting a fed. Mother works 2 jobs. 16 hour days. He does not work. He does not clean. He does not cut grass. Or help at all at home. She gives him money for fast food and gave him a car which she buys gas for. He disappears randomly for a night sometimes and seems to be drinking, and smoking, but hoping the line is drawn there. 

My mother is afraid to say anything to him because she is worried he will harm himself because of his depression, but she is also drowning in taking care of a grown man who is disrespectful to her home (smoking inside, piling dishes in his room, trash everywhere she cleans up etc)

We want to help him, but im trying to gain insight from others. Is this common behavior from someone who is depressed, or is he taking advantage of her fear? If it is true depression (I think it is, but I also think he is using her fear against her), what do we do to help him? What would you want your family to do for you? 

I realize most everyone in this sub is still struggling, so I guess I'm just looking for insight from someone who may have his perspective since he wont give it to us himself"
depression,Mother says I don't need my antidepressants...,"I live with my mom and my sister. We all have depression in some form.

My mother refuses to seek any kind of treatment. She says things like depression is an excuse and she doesn't support ""chemical intervention"" (non-natural antidepressants). I told her a while ago that I feel guilty asking her to take me to see a shrink and she said that's a good thing... Guess who gave up on seeing a shrink after that...

My sister is more supportive - she offered to help me get what I need, as far as medication goes, so I'll be alright all the same. This post is mainly just venting. 

I had recently gotten enough money to pay for my prescribed medication for the first time in months, but I don't have a drivers so I just needed someone to drive me to the doctor to renew my prescription and then to the pharmacy to get what I need. I asked my sister if she could take me, and then my mom chipped in. 


She started asking if maybe I should get the lowest possible dosage because its cheaper. In fact, maybe I shouldn't get it at all. Maybe we should try the over the counter stuff again - that all natural herbal pill that did fuck all to help when we tried it for half a year. She understands how I feel, of course, she says, but she manages just fine without anything. She's just worried about the side effects and she thinks I'm addicted because if I wasn't addicted I wouldn't want it so badly. After all, according to her I'm just chasing a buzz and it will just wear off, like alcohol, and it will leave me feeling as empty as I did before I took it. 

Fuck off. 

Sorry for the long vent post... Of course medication isn't the only way to deal with depression, nor does the same kind of medication work for everyone, but this works for me, I know it does and it sucks to have people who are supposed to care about me try to stand in the way of me getting help..."

depression,trouble talking to my depressed s/o,"
My s/o is putting our relationship on hold rn because i can’t comfort her or really listen or be there for her. i thought i was, but looking back i was seriously just giving unwarranted advice and making her feel like her emotions were invalid and she shouldn’t feel that way. She has BPD along with a lot of trauma so there’s a lot of pain in her life. i’m taking this time to become a better person and try to learn more about her mental illness and be there for her. Looking back i see the error of how i talked to her, but does anyone have any advice for how i can be there for her when she’s sad or down or suicidal, i find it hard to find words and i find it repetitive to constantly say “i’m sorry you’re feeling this way” and i always redirect to something positive but now i know that that isn’t helping or solving anything. i’m so lost at everything, i don’t know where to start, i don’t know how to talk better, but i want to learn and be there for her. Can any of you give any tips or things so i can listen better and be there and not invalidate her emotions when she has these sad or suicidal thoughts. Any good youtube videos you recommend would be appreciated too, thank you. 

i should also mention because i felt like it’s an important thing, because i always made her feel invalid, she just suppressed these feelings and hid them from me so i wouldn’t see that side of her. she suffered in silence for so long and i feel really bad that i put her threw that."
depression,"Lost, Alone, Tired","Graduated about a year ago and still looking for a full time job. Have had maybe 5 interviews but none have transpired into an offer. Dealing with depression (for which I'm in treatment) and living with my father. He lives in a community full of older people/young families, so there are less people my age around. I don't hate my father, but hate living with him. I simply accepted because I had nowhere else to turn. I work 3 days a week and am looking for another part time job (and unemployment) to get more money. Been able to keep myself busy with journaling, reading, video games, TV, occasional physical activity (weather permitting) and job search.

depression,I feel fucking hopeless and like an asshole.,"Ive always had depression but god damn I didn’t know I could sink deeper into this hell hole. Once I lost all of my friends, by that I mean ALL because of my stupid actions, everything went downhill. Tried to apologize, learned from my mistakes but past people do not care about that, only thing they care about is pride and trying to show who’s more ‘stronger’ by letting go of each other because of small mistakes. You’re not stronger than me just because you can let go so easily. I know I’ll find other friends but it’s been months, literal months and it feels like I’m living a dream inside of my head because I don’t want to be in reality. I don’t wanna be here anymore. My girlfriend who’s far away from me tries her best to help, but my sadness gets the best of me everytime and I’m so sorry for that. I wish I was gone so none of you had to deal with my existence, sometimes existence is a beautiful thing but often for me it’s lonely. If I was gone, will they care about me then and feel sorry for what they’ve done? It’s selfish of me but I wish I had the courage to just end it all at once, knowing I’ll leave them all with a bunch of regrets and sadness. I want them to feel what I felt, even worse. I still got so much to live for, but is it even worth it"
depression,I hate everything about me,"I workout but I binge eat chips. I workout but I’m half assing it since the times are all changed and barely have time to cram in my workouts so I miss multiple movements.

I’m late to work despite trying to cut ofmfhdgsgsg down my morning routine. I feel like absolute shot, just crappy and unhappy and this feeling like I wasted my life. I wasted my energy. There’s 0 hope for me. I want to not be here. I cave it. I would rather be anything else but me. I have al kfc sjsjiskoscbwiskensnskofoqpekdndnwosj in my brain. I have no idea where to begin. I want to bang my head against the wall for being such a dumbass. For losing all of my potential. Fucking hell I want to die"
depression,I am not happy,"Maybe i'm taking things for granted, but growing up in an asian household made me feel so repressed, i can't do anything i want, i can't talk about my emotions, i can't talk to my parents about anything because while growing up both of them had 9-5 jobs and i spent most of my time in school or alone at home. as i grew up, i often feel that my actions are unappreciated at home, and my parents always made me feel like i'm not good enough, and sometimes i even feel that i'm being sexualized by my dad, and i can't tell anyone in my family about it. 

this year, i graduated from college, applied to do a phd in europe so that i can finally move away from home, move away from this repressed life - applied to 10 schools and finally got an interview, 5 weeks after the interview, was told that that was not enough funding to admit me. fml, now i'm stuck here, i hate it here, if i ever tell anyone that i'm depressed, nobody would believe me because they think that i have a perfect life, i have everything that i want, and i'm just taking things for granted because i can't appreciate things, i hate my life i just want to leave for awhile or maybe forever

Maybe i'm indeed taking things for granted, unable to appreciate the good in life, therefore i can't be happy, but i wished that it was all that simple. 

i am depressed but i don't want help, i just want to run away from the things that are making me feel worthless and depressed."

This probably doesn’t qualify I jus don’t know what to do"
depression,I want to get help but its hard to explain,"As a male, I consider getting help to be hard, many things we just rather keep in the dark and just die with them. I'm depressed and suicidal but I find it hard to believe I will ever not be.

I have a micro penis, having one comes with many traumatic events in which people dehumanize you and people hate to even hear that you have it or listen to you. It's hard already when society as a whole has deemed you unworthy, it's harder when no one believes you and everyone thinks you are trolling or exagerating.

I really want to be open about my problem, because I know many like me suffer in silence but I don't even know where to begin, how does one even explain this to a therapist. I want to get therapy for it but you have explain it.

after explaining, comes the lies of ''size isn't everything'' look, for most that is valid. But a micro is another league small, also infertility. Not only will I be alone, having a family of my own is impossible.

I don't even know what is the first sentence of explaining this, either I die in silence or humiliate myself, either way it's hard to explain"
depression,I give up,Life really fucks you hard when you are below average intelligence and below average at everything else and you also just completely give up trying at a point I can already see myself on the streets homeless just because I am stupid and unwilling at everything hopefully I die soon so I can escape this hell of being inferior to everyone I meet please something anything just make me stop if I'm still alive in a couple years and everything continues getting worse like it always does I might just kill myself
depression,Just a rant about the health system,"I called to ask for an appointment because I had been suffering from a couple panic attacks beforehand, and they transferred me to a psychiatric ward. 
That psychiatric ward proceeded to bounce me to another hospital, and that hospital decided to bounce me to another, so now I have no idea is I’m going to get treatment or not. 
I know Covid is affecting the pace at which they do things but I just need an appointment, something? Pills? Because I really can’t function anymore... I honestly hope that the hospital(whichever one I’m at) will just help me already..."

depression,I've given up hope that I'm ever going to feel better,"I've been on and off depression and anxiety meds for the last 9 years. I'm tired of being told give it time and work on it and it will get better. I've given it time.

I really feel like I have concentration problems, idk if it's ADHD or w/e the term for it is now, but I do. Doctors won't listen to me about it because I'm depressed and have anxiety, but I really feel that lack of focus makes everything worse and if we could address it things would get better.

At first they listened, once I finally dared to bring it up, did psych evals that said everything was fine. That was 2 years ago, and still no improvement. Since then it's just been more depression meds, anxiety meds that literally do nothing for my anxiety and just make me so tired that I'm even more miserable. I just want to function like a human again, I'm tired of only being able to do things when my brain is obsessed about doing it. And now, I'm on to a new doctor because I got fed up with the depression and anxiety line. 

Now I'm filled with doubt because I know anxiety and depression make concentration worse, it's not like it's not a valid statement. But I really feel there is something else going on. And I have no hope that a doctor is going to take me seriously as long as I'm depressed and anxious. And I feel the only way to resolve those is to start with the concentration. And I have no power in this argument. So I'm just gonna keep moving on to new doctors hoping one will take me seriously. Yay for more years of pain and suffering and hopelessness."
depression,can’t medicate again,I can’t start this medication again. I can’t live with the lack of libido again. All of these side effects from the various meds only exasperate the depression. Whether it’s the lack of libido with the Escitalopram or the weight gain with the Sertraline or the rage and paranoia with the Wellbutrin. I don’t even remember what I was feeling like before these meds but I think it’s worse now than it ever was on nothing. I’ve been consistently taking something since February 2019. I was supposed to start back on the Escitalopram yesterday after giving the Wellbutrin time to get out of my system. I can’t find any desire to start them again. Sure the anxiety is up and I’m not sleeping but those could also be a result of stopping the other med.

I seriously only exist and mindlessly watch TV shows and listen to music to fill the time and take my mind off the fact that I am a useless parasitic member of society. Fuuuuuuuck this, the apathy and anhedonia  are slowly killing me and my sanity. Where do I go from here? Living in a really small town in an ex-commie country doesn't help since mental health is still considered taboo so most of the advice is just grow up and suck it up"

My mom randomly came into my room after I went downstairs to ask them if dinner happened yet (theyre gone 60% percent of the day and I cant cook so I never get to eat a proper meal) And they said ""That happened a few hours ago dude"" Me being super pissed but not trying to show it grabbed a protein shake out of the fridge and went up stairs to go back to watching youtube and my mom comes in and says ""We need to talk"". Knowing this wasnt gonna be good I paused the video and listened to her say thay I dont wanna be apart of this family, that they never see me, I sleep too late, my brother is better than me, I dont do anything good and etc everything to degrade me. I told her than shes gone most of the day so I cant eat (Two days ago she took the whole family out for the coolest breakfest ever KNOWING I was already awake.), I told her she seems mad and uninterested when I try to talk to her, I told her that Its summer so Im staying up late, I told her I wasnt happy, and I told her I love her but she never seems to love me back so I dont try to engage with her often. She says she'll talk more about it in the morning and left. After that I cried and now Idk what to say to her in the morning.

It’s not like I’m normally hanging out with friends all the time, but it being only them who I get to talk to is just making me hate myself more and more. That’s anything new, but I just feel like I’m falling deeper into a hole I can’t escape. It’s also making my adhd worse so getting work done is become near impossible, at least in any kind of time efficient way. I’m bad at reaching out to people and I always worry I’m a bother and people don’t want to talk to me or I annoy them and so I feel like I’m just slipping further and further into this spiral of feeling alone all the time.

depression,Am I depressed? I hope not,"Last time my bf said that I’m depressed. I mean idk, is wanting to die and feeling like a worthless piece of shit equivalent of being depressed? Is self harming also a thing that people do when they’re depressed? I genuinely don’t know. Is wanting to cry every single day equivalent of being sad or depressed? I don’t know. 

Maybe I’m dumb for asking these types of questions but I just scared. I have no reason to be sad most of the time. 

I’ve also been to 2 therapists and they never said I’m depressed. They just said I’m anxious or smth I don’t know. But I don’t know anything about me since I got angry and left every time I go to a therapist..

So am I depressed? Or am I just a whiny bitch?"

My own girlfriend tells me on a regular basis how shitty of a person I am... I don’t understand... why am I still here? What is my purpose? I breathe this air with no reason. I blink and wake up everyday without a purpose. I’m 21 turning 22 next month with no desire to even live. My life is in shambles. Covid is kicking me down everyday... I’m worthless. I just wish I wasn’t such a pussy and could pull that trigger... I wish last month during the riots I went and bought that pistol. The life I have could’ve been somewhere better. Life isn’t worth it, you’re always broke, you’re always sad, nobody cares about you. Nobody asks how you are, why you are the way you are. Nobody cares. I hate my life.

I also have sleep apnea which is horrible on its own but anyway, I have quetiapine to help me sleep and it helps alot escape this reality. The only problem is that it knocks the crap out of me I can sleep up to 14 hours and feel like a zombie after waking up or just not get quality sleep at all ( I dont have a cpap machine ) Here im a loser with no friends and nobody wanting me around and in my dreams i can be anybody or anything. I have tried to commit suicide in the past and I am recieving Counselling for some mental health problems it just sucks that I wish I could be amongst real people without feeling overwelmed or having the thoughts that everyone is thinking negativly about me.

I thought about killing myslef today. I don’t know why. I don’t want to die. I’ve never wanted to die. I want to live. But the depression is beginning to take control over me But I won’t let it. I won’t leave my brothers and sisters. I won’t leave my mom. I will not leave the people who love me, I refuse to let them feel the emptiness, the numbness, the constant pain. No one deserves to feel as worthless as I do right now. And I will not let all those people who left me, who put me down, who chose drugs over me, those who ridiculed me, win, these people don’t deserve to win. They deserve to see me make a difference in this world. I will make a difference and I will change the world. All it takes to change the world, is to change one persons life.And when I find my person, I will give them everything the world has taken from them. But most importantly I will help them find their happiness. Evil exists, but its hidden, it’s within the people who we give our trust to. Don’t let this evil ruin you, or anyone you love.

depression,I can feel myself falling off the edge and it’s scaring me,"I struggle severely with depression. I’ve posted on here for help before on other subs and have searched for advice for my life but now I’m at a point where I know I’m almost ready to give up. I’ve never been a person to really see myself going into total self destruction but it seems that it’s becoming impossible to avoid. I’m 21 years old, no job, no car, 0.45 cents to my name. I’m in a household where I support my step dad whose got 2 months left and my mother who tells me when to breathe and how to do it. She’s disabled and uses that to her advantage to get me to put my life at a stand still to care after her and my wheelchair bound grandmother. I have no social life and my only real interaction comes from the internet. I share a bedroom with my parents and feel as though I am going to go no where in life. I was accepted into a phlebotomy program that starts in September but my mom is completely against it because it’ll mean I won’t be here and she’s telling me she’s going to have another amputation soon. But this is also the same woman who makes me feel like I’m nothing for not having a job. When I want a job she tells me I shouldn’t work instead I should sell my virginity and make more because “the first time doesn’t really matter”. Anyway I just feel as though the walls of life are finally starting to cave in. I’m a year clean from self harm and yesterday I decided that I didn’t know if that’s what I wanted anymore so I went and bought a box of blades and hid them in a shoebox. Even though I didn’t cut yet I feel disappointed in myself. But yet I still really want to. I don’t drink but as the days go on I’m starting to want nothing more than to just numb it with a bottle, a blade and sleeping pills. Maybe I’m wrong to vent I don’t know exactly why I’m telling people this. I guess I just feel like there’s really going to be no tomorrow for me soon."
depression,Life is so unfair...I don’t deserve this,"A year ago, I quit a well paid job, that simply didn’t inspire me (it was basically a customer service desk job). My co-workers were an uninspiring, lazy and simply annoying bunch of people. Was I wrong to quit something I didn’t feel great about? The only thing I felt good about was the money.

Anyways, life punched me in the gut for quitting that job. After quitting, I became broke and as a result lazy. I realized you can’t do much when u got 0 bucks on your bank account. I also realized how happy those things made me that I was able to buy with the money, as boring the job even was (traveling, food etc)

After a few weeks tho, I found a job as a salesman which pays not as good as before. Fast forward a year, a pandemic has hit the world and I lose my job as a salesman. Meanwhile, all those lazy people from my old job still got their jobs, mind you, they even got promotions and get 3 times as much as I get.

Wtf. I’m sick of this. I don’t deserve this."

I don’t think I want to go on with life if I’m just going to be in quarantine for the rest of my life. My family members views are very toxic, homophobic and just downright disgusting. Every day my anxiety gets worse. I ask to go to a psychologist every day but my parents refuse to let me go. I don’t think I can handle any of it any more. This seems minuscule but I was supposed to send mail back to EDD to receive money and I couldn’t even do that and am late by a few weeks. I am a failure I can’t even get a job right now. Every place I’ve applied to keeps rejecting me. I need money desperately so I can buy a car or save up to move out. Everything is so hopeless. All I do is lay in bed all day and worry. I miss seeing people. I miss seeing my friends. I just don’t know what to think about going on with life if it’s going to be this hopeless.

depression,So fucking alienated,"I just cannot relate to people or care about things going on. Everyone seems so distant and far removed. They seem to think completely differently. I cannot be bothered with almost anyone and, of course, this feeling is mutual. It takes so much time and effort to even find glimpses of something that feels familiar even in places that are already niche. Why even bother? Socializing and life in general just feels like a boring game I never asked to be a part of. Am I just pretending that I'm *""special""*, real *quirky* and *totally not like the other girls*? (scrape the pm, I'm a guy)

Why does this matter? Just look at what happens with more distance from humans. Interactions in vs outside of a kin and between different groups (by gender, ethnicity, race, etc.). Treatment of other species and the environment as a whole. *It's all fucked.* The more difference and distance is seen, the less empathy and sympathy there is. At some, not so far away, point you just become an object to them and the primal desire to belong and be valued by others weighs on you. 

All of this, of course, almost always outside of your control. Just join your predetermined tribe, change yourself to fit their standards (at least enough to not be excluded) and pray to god that your tribe is the stronger one."

depression,Thinking about suicide is comforting,"I've been sad and depressed for as long as I can remember. No one likes being around me anymore because I'm always sad, crying, or on the edge of crying. Even my family. There's nothing worth living for in my life. I've tried many therapists, many drugs legal and illegal, nothing works. It doesn't help that I've never really excelled at anything, I'm just...there, an inconvenience for everyone. The only things that brings me some sensation of comfort is thinking about killing myself. 

I tried before, with pills, it didn't work but I still have long term physical issues because of it, my roommate found me at the time. A couple of months ago I planned out how I'd do it this time, even picked a time when my roommate was visiting her family and staying with them for a few days so she wouldn't find me and ruin everything like before. But she had a fight with her parents and came home the day I was going to do it. The idea of dying doesn't make me sad it makes me feel at ease, but the idea of another failed suicide attempt is terrifying so I'm always waiting for the perfect time to do it when nothing can go wrong. 

I'm just venting, not looking for someone to talk me out of it and not looking for someone to tell me I have other options because trust me, I don't."

depression,i feel like i’m the disappointment of my family,"i’ve posted this in another subreddit bc idk where to go for help 


Sorry if this doesn’t match the theme but i need help and i don’t know where to ask for it. I feel like the disappointment of my family. i’ve got two siblings, one younger and one older. the oldest one is in college studying to be a lawyer, he’s just finished school while working two jobs. he ended his undergraduate with good grades, a pretty high gpa, and two jobs to help him sustain himself while he studies for the last. the youngest one is in high school. she’s taking two summer classes on goes form 8-1 and the other is a self paced one. she wakes up early to walk her dogs once in the morning (6am) and another in the afternoon (6pm). so she’s up at 6, walks the dogs, gets ready and spends the rest of her day studying and focused on school. 

both my brother and sister are on top of their game. they’re very hard working and are extremely caring. they go out of their ways to help others whenever they can. 

yesterday my mom was crying and i asked her what was wrong and she told me that she’s crying bc she realized how amazing her children are. this hurt me although i know it shouldn’t have.

i began to think about how i compare to my siblings. i’m an undergrad but it’s summer. i didn’t take any summer classes and i’m not working. i stay at home on my phone all day and just clean the house. that’s all i’ve been doing since i got back home bc of covid. i feel like i’m not doing anything and wasting my life away while my siblings are working hard towards their future. i feel like a disappointment bc i spend more of my days laying down on my phone not doing anything. i want to do something productive so that i don’t feel worthless but i have trouble finding to motivation to do anything. i haven’t showered in a few days despite the heat, i either never it or overeat, and i just feel like i’m rotting away. my body feels like shit, i’m gaining weight by the min, i’m inactive, i don’t do anything to stimulate my brain, i’m not working, i don’t do shit. i feel low and disgusting and i’m tired of it. i want to learn how i can overcome this feeling and do something productive so that i don’t feel worthless and like shit. i see my siblings do all this work while i stay in bed all day not doing anything and i feel pathetic. again sorry if this doesn’t fit the theme i just don’t know where to ask for help/advice. 

TL;DR - i feel like a disappointment in the family bc i’ve got two very hard working siblings doing work so much for their future while i lay in bed all day."

I would say I am more lonely than sad, but I am always around people. I do enjoy their company it is just that being with friends only temporarily hides my loneliness. I want to love someone. I have known my friends for years, and I really like them but how do I know if I love them, how do I know if I even love my family. I do not care if people love me or not. I do not really like when others are affectionate to me. I do physically show affection, but its just movements, I do not really feel anything.

depression,I wake up wishing I didnt,"Every day is just pain. My body isn't in the greatest condition. I never know when I will wake up to horrible pain. I'm blessed with understanding this world and it's people, and know it will never lead to anything because nobody listens to you. My parents are so blind in their faith that they refuse to see that they worship a god that just takes and takes without ever giving in return, only 'testing them' again and again. I wake up every day wishing I didn't. Wishing I didn't have to experience more. I'm just so tired of everything. My only saving grace is my girlfriend. She is everything to me, and is the only light in my day. She loves me like nobody else ever has. But I don't know how long she'll be enough. She is torn. Torn between me and her abusive family. She refuses to let go of them, and she won't choose me over them. I do as much as I can for her. I gave her a home away from them, and am actually trying to get her health back in a good place. But it just doesn't seem like enough.and that pains me more than I can say. That's what eats away at what little hope I hold onto. I know she loves me. I can tell when she lies to me, so I know she loves me, but does she love me enough to choose me. That's what I don't know. And I don't know if she will choose me. She's told me she would, bit she hasn't. Actions speak louder than words, and she has acted less than half as much as she's spoken. I just don't know how long I can hold onto a fading dream to give me life. It hurts. Everything hurts. I hoped she would be the only completely good thing in my life, but that's too much to ask. She has asked me to someday give her kids, but I don't want to have kids. I will give them to her because I want her to be happy, and of course I'll care for them, but I don't want them. I don't want to lose what little freedom I'm allowed, and more importantly I don't want something to have to live on this accursed planet because of me. I hate nearly everything about this world. It's so infuriating. The people, their ideals, their missions, their truths, their gods, all of it is infuriating and idiotic. I hate seeing it every single day, everywhere I look. I just don't know how much longer I can put up with it all.......I don't know how much longer everything will be worth the pain I go through just by existing......I just wish everything could stop......I just want it all to end......even if it means it all goes to darkness and everything ceases, my mind, my soul, my heart, all of it. That'd be a preferable alternative. Even if there is a hell, I'd prefer it. I wouldn't have a good for things to get better. I wouldn't have dreams. At least in hell you are expected to suffer, but not deal with it quietly."
depression,I want to end everything,"I know people say that things do get better but honestly, nothing really gets better. After all the self harm, substance abuse, therapy, meds, I don't know what people still want from me. My friends are all gone because I pushed them all away and maybe someone cares but I can't feel anything. My head keeps replaying the same detailed convincing scene on how I'm gonna kill myself over and over again and I just feel like if I didn't feel scared about leaving my parents, there's absolutely nothing that would convince me to stay. Even now, I don't really care about anything...My physical health, trust in people, my future...I'm gonna kill myself some when and I really don't see the point of waiting for the inevitable

I know I deserve all of it, I just didn't expect I'd be punished so soon. I guess I have to deal with the consequences of being a worthless piece of shit.

depression,"It's either me or life that is a bitch, and I keep getting hints that it might be both: a view of life from the perspective of a confused teenager","Since my coming to the U.S. four years ago, I had to go through a lot of change. I had dreams back then, so I decided to be flexible because I saw opportunity in being so. I also come from a very culturally tied, family with a religious background. Being in a land where I saw an overwhelming amount of opportunities, and more importantly, freedom. after about a year, I decided to go on my way and possibly discard my family because I couldn't see myself living in a society that involves the kind of strict tradition, and many more worse attributes that possibly relate to that, that my family was living in(even inside that U.S.).

I have not been able to believe in a God, or a superior being since I was 12, or 13. I just could't stand the idea that I was the subject of some being that I don't even have proof of it's existence. After a time, I couldn't stop thinking up reasons to not believe in God because I hadn't completely become a ""nonbeliever,"" mainly due to the fact that I was raised extremely religious.

Then someday I snapped, everything around me turned colorless. All my ambitions...gone. It's as if I woke up a different person one day. I couldn't believe in anything, not even myself. A deep sadness crept into my life because I realized, no I believed and still believe, that I couldn't be free.

That came from that fact that I felt essential to my family, being that only one that could speak English. My family became reliant on me. I felt choked, held down, imprisoned, and I had no response to my emotions because I felt threatened of the power my parents had over me. As long as I'm not a citizen, I had no power over anything by law, my father has. I could be sent back to my original country anytime they notice I had gone berserk, or out of their own lines, and be in realistically in a large prison for my body and mind. Keep in mind that I come from a third world country.

Like most immigrant parents my parents have ambitions for me, and for a while those ambitions were designated. My father wanted me to be either a lawyer, or a doctor when he saw how far my ambitions strayed off the norm. He kept pressuring me until I confronted him, though he snapped at me and said I was disrespectful, and expressed his disappointment, to later call me a faggot, as he usually does when he gets angry at me. The good thing is that he actually stopped putting pressure on my to be what he wanted to be, to just be good at school.

After many occasions like this, and much worse, I had decided that my life is truly not worth living. I discarded having friends because my dad would always blame them for any of my wrong doing, and I just want to give him less reason to give me shit. I hate people because of how much my parents care about their opinion on us. I hated everything for being idle while I felt so many emotions, and felt like I truly suffered. I felt more suffering and pain here more than I ever did back when I was poor living in the mountains in a third world country, in fact I was happy as a child.

I feel like I could do something, but in reality I cant. That's why I think I'm a bitch because when the time comes to do something. I have an image in my head of me freezing in the face of any life decision that involves my family. I feel like not having a putrid life ,such as mine, would get me out of my misery. Still, I don't want to hurt my family. My mother is a good person that is traditionally, and religiously oppressed because of her gender, so she leans on religion and God to justify most things in her life. Same goes for my sister, she is a year younger than me, but I'm not sure how religious she is because she can't show, nor can I.

Concluding this because I feel like I had gone for too long. One of us or both, me or life, is a bitch. I can't handle how emotionally unstable I am. I keep dumping every little thing on myself and feel bad about it. At some point I resorted to hurting myself to feel anything other than I was feeling. It worked for a while than it became a chore when I had to hide the scars. I still have to hide them. At this point I can't get myself to have any reason to be alive, except misery and I'm sick of it. I used to have the people I adored at school, crushes, be a motivation. To see them when I go to school made me feel better, even though I couldn't talk to them because even talking to a person I like could get me in a shit hole. But where I am now, I can't get myself to feel anything for anyone. It's similar to the hedgehog dilemma, I can get close to someone but to a certain extent, but at some point it starts hurting. I don't mind getting hurt, but I don't like hurting others especially if I like them. I can't prove myself wrong, that life is not worth living, another person's journey might be but just not mine. I just cant stop thinking about what will happen if I kill myself will everything just be over, also it's a good way to check if god is real. I also can't go to a psychiatrist because it's expensive and my parents would thing I'm crazy. There is a lot more that I feel like I can't say on here, but this is part of how I feel. I can't stop thinking about killing myself."
depression,:'(,Being emotionally unstable is shit
depression,I can’t sleep until 5 am then wake up at 4pm still exhausted and depressed bc I am awake,"Hi, 21 F here. I’ve had depression for around 9 years with periods of severe depressive episodes scattered throughout. I’m in one at the moment as covid has effected my mental health incredibly negatively, I would say that I am almost suicidal and I have panic attacks every day. It is effecting my sleep which is in turn effecting my mental health more so. 

My anxiety is so bad I cannot sleep until around 5 am despite ‘going to bed’ at 1-2. I lay in bed for hours listening to my bf sleep while not being able to get my brain to shut up. I have tried melatonin, doesn’t work for me. I have been trying over the counter sleeping tablets, they work briefly for a few days- a week and then my body just gets used to them, they also cause me when they do work to be drowsy and tired the next day anyway. I have had a night where I took 5 of these sleeping pills and I was still awake at 6 am because of how powerful my anxiety is.

When I do wake up, within an hour I get incredibly depressed and anxious and I am sad that I am awake. I’ve been trying to get out and do things a bit more, but it’s difficult because by the time I wake up it is night time. The other day I went to photograph the sunset because I hadn’t slept and ended up falling asleep at 10 am.

My sleep cycle is making my already bad mental health even worse and I don’t know what to do. I have just got a new psychologist however our appointments are spaced a fortnight apart, and last time (my 2nd appointment with her) she was sick and because of how busy the agency is our appointment was pushed back another 2 weeks (this Friday). I don’t think I can wait this excessive amount of time to get help through therapy quick enough before my mental health gets worse. My boyfriend who I am practically dependant on now (because I hardly can leave the room, can’t go into the kitchen because of my anxiety) is leaving to go back to England in a few weeks as he is an exchange student and he is my lifeline right now. 

I don’t know what to do about any of this."
depression,Started again,So I started cutting myself again since my girlfriend cheated on me and broke up with me and I just don't want to life anymore. I'm thinking about suicide the hole time....im just sick of this world
depression,Can't listen to music anymore,I am 21 and I was never diagnosed with depression but I am quite sure I have had it for the last 8 years. I used to listen to music to heal myself a bit but nowadays when I listen to music I instantly start crying. The only good thing that my life had is also been taken away :(
depression,"Don't want to die but if it happens, it happens. (rant)","That's kind of been my (22f) mentality for years now. I only feel the need to end my life when I'm under severe pressure (which I do to myself by postponing every responsibility to the last possible second) and I've only been close to going through with it 2 times.

I realized that not everyone has dark thoughts on the regular in high school when a friend of mine and I were sharing secrets and I told her that I kind of pictured myself dying almost daily for no apparent reason and she looked at me as if I had grown two heads. Apparently not a thing mentally healthy people did very often. (First and last time I ever shared that secret for sure.)

I'm a sad human being that has literally nothing to be sad about. I know people find me good-looking, I study at university, even started taking courses for a profession that I would say I am passionate about, I have friends that I know care about me and a good happy family. 

And even then two days ago I had another mental breakdown in which I bawled my eyes out in my room, then washed my face and went on to talk with my family as if nothing was wrong. Since they very rarely see me looking down my mom noticed but I brushed it off as me being worried about an upcoming exam.

That happens more often than I'd like to admit. Me being sad or quiet is weird for other people, even if they don't pay attention or care about whatever I'm talking about. It's like they feel uncomfortable with me being quiet and think I'm angry at them or being bitchy. 

I could never talk about this subject with people IRL since I would sound like I am just whining or complaining over nothing, or as if I'm being dramatic or looking for attention. Even I think I sound stupid when I try to articulate it myself and just shut myself up because I don't want people to think I'm overreacting.

I am aware that other people have lives, more difficult than me, and I should be thankful that I'm living in such a good environment and with good people, but I kind of don't mind being hit by a car, so I guess that's that."
depression,Out of options,Anyone else feel like they have made a hundred bad decisions and it’s led to this point where it’s basically impossible that life will actually one day be good?
depression,Can't even force myself to eat,"Is the fourth day i haven't eat anything except for some snacks here and there.I just can't eat at all, not even tasty food that i used to like, i feel my body wasting away and can't do anything about it.I tried some tips from the internet but still no result, depression sucks."
depression,Getting medication,"I finally decided to ring up my doctors for medication after months of being unable to gather up the courage to do so. Got given a prescription and hopefully the medication will help me. Therapy didnt help, CBT didnt help, hopefully this will.

I've been depressed for as long as i can remember, hopefully this will change something."
depression,I woke up today not feeling suicidal,"It's a small victory, but I'll take it. It may just be another penny drop in my life that happened too late, but clear as day I heard myself say, actually, I don't want to die.

Am I happy? No. Have I work to do? Yes. I still feel hopeless and broken. But I'll take that thought as a step in the right direction. Just felt like sharing. I never thought I'd get to this place. 
There's hope for us yet."
depression,Things that make me happy are not meant for me,"I have always been in a constant debate in my head when ""I'm happy, how long will it last?"". As soon as I get to have fun in life, things just go south and makes me even sadder. I feel like these passing things are not really meant for me but is meant for other people, it just so happens that it will stop by for a short amount of time. 

Everything that I held as something precious just isnt with me anymore. I just want something that stays with me."
depression,Tired.,"In my final year of degree, and someone broke into my room last night. My laptop and wallet were stolen. My phone was saved because it was in my pocket."

depression,What Is The Best Way To Die Without Pain?,Hi I'm trying to get the best way to end all of my pain in life.I fell sick with having puberphonia getting bullied my parents not liking me it just sucks in this world
depression,ill never be proud of myself,"sorry. messy post. i haven’t slept all night. if i didn’t fail miserably at uni, i would’ve graduated today. my social media is filled with people i used to know, talk to, pass with flying colours. so many people. they actually have something to show for their uni debt. ive accumulated three yrs worth of debt with nothing to show for it.

ive never been proud of myself and i never will feel any sort of pride for myself. i have no talent to fall back on, no skills. all my energy has been sucked out writing this. im so tired but i can’t sleep because my thoughts are jumbled and screaming at me. GAHHHH im really empty. this makes no sense. it’ll probably get lost. i just wanted to rant"
depression,I'm tired.,"And I'm tired of being tired. 
I'm fucking tired."
depression,"I don't want to make people unhappy, so I don't talk about being depressed.","I feel like opening up and talking to people would be fine if it resulted in me being cured, but that hasn't happened. I felt better after some time passing, then depressed for months, then almost ok, then depressed again etc and it's ben like that for a decade.

So I gave up on letting people know if I'm not feeling good, and just try to act like everything's ok. I tell myself I have to wait it out, and I'll be back to normal again for a while.

People don't know how to deal with it or help me, and it just seems to make others unhappy to hear that I'm unhappy.

I've decided I can never kill myself, for the same reason I don't tell people I'm depression. I don't want to make people unhappy, so that's why. My parents were young when they had me, so they could be alive for another 40 years. 

I tried a few different medications, therapy, exercise, eating healthier and still wasn't ""cured"". Maybe I should have kept trying different medications, I'm thinking of trying again. I'm also looking for a SAD light box/lamp. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm fortunate to not feel awful all the time like some of you here.

I just feel empty inside, things don't feel valuable or worth doing and I have little energy. I'm tired of talking about it with people in my life, it'd just be repeating myself.

I can still sometimes enjoy books, movies, games, and eating food. It's nice while it lasts. Then after it's over I remember how fucked I am \^\^

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so alone in this. Not like there aren't others going through similar things, but that I have to face this alone, with no support that makes it easier.

There's only so many times I can tell a therapist a version of ""I still feel the same, without anything wrong in my life that would warrant feeling this way"". 

I'm tired of feeling relatively emotionless and alone. Maybe some different medication and the SAD lamp will help. (How can I trust a lamp to make me better when it's sad too?)"
depression,Suicide jokes,"I feel as if most people who are depressed say they like mentioning suicide jokes as a way to cope and make their depression seem more lightweight, which I respect.

But being diagnosed with depression myself and also suicidal, I feel as if normalising suicide jokes really triggers me - its become so normal for people to say it, the same way people say ‘lol’ and no one takes it seriously anymore. 

It makes me feel worse as it reminds me that depression is considered so normal and common nowadays that it gives me less hope to even be better, as if depression is now a normal standard of living and there’s no way out of it within newer generations. 

I somewhere hope when most people say these jokes they’re not actually being serious- it would make me feel sad to see that so many people I frequent are in the same dark place as me, but I know that for many it’s also a relief for them to know they’re not alone (and in a way, if it makes them feel better to do so, it makes me feel better too).

 Thanks for reading :)"
depression,Don’t mean to sound too dramatic but had another dream of killing someone,"This is my second dream now of killing someone, no I’m not a psychopath or some weirdo, they are more like nightmares and I feel immense regret after ‘killing him’ to the point where I wake up and thank god it’s just a dream. 
In this dream the person I killed abused prostitutes, and I was so angry with him I remember crying with rage in my dream, at some point I just snapped and when right after him, it was a full on fight and was scary how realistic it was, I could physically feel him bite me as I strangled him. After I killed him I feel this immense regret of ‘wtf have I done I’m never going to accept this’ and ‘the only way I can overcome this never ending feeling or regret is by killing myself’.

Yes it might sound super concerning but it’s just a dream, I just wonder if this is linked with my anxiety and depression?"
depression,I feel like I have nothing to look forward to,"this is definitely the most empty I've ever felt. without a doubt in my mind, I cannot find joy in anything anymore. I don't look forward to anything in my day, I can't even seem to remember what day it is without actually looking at the date, life has no worth to me right now. I don't even feel like anyone looks forward to talking to me, I guess that's what I get for becoming a depressed empty silent little bitch. I actually don't believe anyone genuinely cares anymore, not a single bit. but who am i fucking kidding, not like i deserve it, im fucking horrible at keeping good relationships with the people I consider close to me, the bastard called depression makes me distance myself from them because it makes me believe they don't care anymore. and it's probably right! do i know if they do or not? i have no fucking clue but probably not considering they also stopped attempting to talk to me. idk what to do anymore honestly. I just wanna go to the edge of a bridge and wait and see if someone, doesn't even have to be someone i know, if they would stop and see if I'm okay. I just need some positive reassuring that things will get better, but with the current situations in the world, I don't know that it will anytime soon, and that makes me feel so much worse"
depression,"Burnt out, leading to depression and not caring about anything","Male, 30s, married with kids.

It's been going on for the last 7 months, just getting worse."
depression,How do I control anger and screaming???,I get so angry depressed and upset sometimes it leads me to scream shout and cry. My neighbour has called the police twice on me now and I’m sick of it. How do I let out my feelings without making a noise I don’t know what to do anymore
depression,Not even food fulfills me anymore,"I just realized this recently, after having a long streak of ordering food. Eating pizza feels like eating dough with toppings. I feel like this about every dish now. No sense of euphoria or anything. Eating food was seriously my only sense of happiness, but now it seems that is gone too."
depression,All Life isn’t Equal,"Not sure where people’s beliefs lies but I’ve come to just realize and accept not all life is created equal in value. I’m living proof of it. There isn’t anything I’m good at (even more accurate to say I’m bad at most things in life) and regardless of whether I try, my best will always be subpar. My life is living proof of the inherit inequality in life and that isn’t to say that life is pointless but there are certainly aspect of life that hold zero value but people will tell you otherwise"

I can smell flowers. They remind me of Ginger. 

I can eat yummy food

So I don’t hurt my brother

I can sleep in a comfortable bed

I can laugh one day. Hopefully. Fingers crossed

So I can feel the strong cold breeze against my face. I love the cold

I can watch the rain while drinking coffee. That’s good

I can find a community of people who understand me. 

I can watch movies and listen to music

One day, some day, I can find insane happiness. Even if it’s just for a moment. I can find happiness that makes me believe living was worth it."
depression,Anyone have an album full of pretty attractive girls on Instagram and admire how beautiful they are? Anyone else ever admire those photos and just think of how great a relationship you can give them?,[removed]
depression,I hope I'm getting better.,"The past couple of months have been the hardest for me in a long time. Maybe the worst mentally, I dont really remember. I was withering away, not eating, barely sleeping, chain smoking in the hopes I get cancer, self-isolating for days, not showering, brushing, having constant late-night manic spirals that ended with me staring at my own clenched fists, thinking about my gun a few feet away and psyching myself up, saying ""just do it"" over and over again. 

I let drugs rule my life. Weed became my only passion, shrooms my only escape, and the anxiety of getting more and being careful was inducing incredible anxiety and paranoia. It's not the substance, its the abuse that gets you. 

In the past week I've gotten a bit better, I think. I can eat an almost normal-sized meal every day, sometimes even without being very high. Ive started a small (out of necessity, chronic illness plus depression is a helluva combo) bodyweight workout routine, as it helped me greatly in college. Ive left the house more days than not this week. I feel slightly more cognitive than I was before, which is great as the loss of my relatively high-functioning intellect was a major factor in my struggle. 

I'm constantly worried that I will keep slipping, as I just don't feel I have the energy to do anything if I dont sleep for 9-12 hours.  But for now, I think I see progress. Baby steps towards the real me, if there is such a thing. I'm considering some kind of professional help, but I dont even know if I need it now that I can eat again and Ive really cut back on the drugs and smoking. I don't even feel like I need to be high 24/7, I only use when I really want to or when my aching becomes severe. 

Heres to hoping tomorrow I can will myself to get cleaned up, maybe even see my (extremely caring, wonderful, though also struggling) girlfriend. :)"

depression,I got a promotion today and felt nothing,"My boss announced to our team that I was receiving a promotion today and I feel nothing. 

Not because I dislike my job- I love it on a good day. But because I feel so numb about everything in my life right now. Or angry. 

There are a lot of issues in my life that has me emotionally exhausted. I don't get sad. The only emotion I feel is anger if anything at all. 

I just feel ready to explode or run away... is this depression or anxiety.. I don't know anymore."
depression,I wish I didn’t wake up this morning,My body will not let me sleep. I’m so depressed idk what to do at this point. I woke this morning after only 5 hours just crying bc my eyes opened again this morning. I don’t feel anything towards anyone these days... I so so tired of living.

She messaged me two days ago saying that she really needed to talk to someone and that I was her last resort. She frequently talks about how she misses her ex and how her friends were temporary and never helped her when she was in a dark state. She also suffers from domestic abuse (Her father is abusive).
I barely even know the girl and I feel I can not help her because I've got no idea what to do, when she messages me that she's thinking of ending it or whe she's feeling breathless, or having a panic attack. Can anyone guide me on how to cope with this situation?"
depression,Any advice?,"My new therapist says I'm an introverted empath. Meaning I keep to myself but care more for others than I do for myself.

I just spent hours trying to track down my psychotic mother after 15 years of no contact to stalk and scare her from anonymous accounts. I paid for services to obtain her address and phone number (to no avail).

I tracked down a guy who abused my ex who hung herself in a closet a well after I cut her out of my life and sent him very ominous messages and veiled threats, I've never met the guy, apparently he's an engineer now. I don't feel he deserves any happiness in his life either.

I just recovered from being run over by a truck while crossing a crosswalk which resulted in 1 well in the hospital and a month of being barely able to move. I reflected on the experience tonight and realized I never cared if I healed because my only purpose to exist is to build on other people's dreams because in 33 years I've ended up with no aspirations or goals and barely any friends (which I can't blame anyone but me for).

I've been a despicable person to innocent people who who I claimed and led to believe I loved.

Everything is over. The wave has broken on the jagged obsidian shoreline of bygone dreams where i could've become a person that could live an admirable life.

depression,Managing,"Hey all! I'm fairly new to reddit so i'm not 100% sure what i'm doing, but i get the jist. Anyways, here goes nothing! May be some triggers below.

I've had mild depression since middle school, and for the most part, I've been doing okay. Until recently. My ex boyfriend has been harassing me *(again),* which has caused an onslaught of unpleasant memories to hit me. I've also been having a really shitty time at work (my co-workers like to take their frustrations out on me.) It's taken a huge toll on my mental and physical health during this past week. I try to talk to people about it, but they all seem largely uninterested (which I understand, it's not their problem to deal with.) I don't really have anyone to vent to. I'm not trying to seem like a victim here either, i'm just venting how I feel. I understand that I need to work on myself to make things better. 

I haven't slept in two days and all the pent up stress had been affecting my performance at work. I constantly feel everyone hates me and thinks I'm annoying. It's been making me super suicidal and I don't have any motivation to do anything. I was also out of work for three weeks (because I had to get tested for Covid and it took three weeks to get my results back...) and now I'm super fucking broke. Like in the negative hundreds. My parents are also being super hard on me to save money and be more responsible. I feel like everyone in the world is against me, and I'm only liked when they can use me for something. This isn't supposed to be a pity post, I would just love to talk to people who have been going through similar dilemmas, or just anyone that can give me any tips or advice on how to break this cycle. I don't go to therapy (can't afford it) and don't really have many friends I can bother with this type of thing. I'm starting to feel very alone and feel like I should isolate and distance myself from others. I just don't feel like I bring anything to the table, and I feel like I just annoy everyone around me. Of course, it's probably because I'm generally a negative person, but I truly am trying my best to fix that.

I want to tell my grandparents but I can't bring myself to burden them with thinking they've failed me as guardians and tell the rest of my family. I can't tell my friends and make them feel obligated to help me or feel to uncomfortable and leave. Hell, I can't even fucking tell a chat specifically made to tell people anonymously about struggles your having, instead I found it better to keep it in cause I thought ""people here are having it worse than me so I'll try to listen and help them"" instead of at least saying SOMETHING that had to do with me. This is one of my worst traits. I can't physically ask for help, so I just hide it behind a smile and a ""good morning"" and wait for someone to ask ""are you ok?"" but I know deep down that I can't wait for that to happen. It needs to be me, but I'm scared. Scared of if I actually do have depression. Scared of what my family will think of me. Scared of what my family will think of themselves. Scared of my friends leaving. Scared of my whole world crashing down and changing beyond the point of recognition. Scared of what will happen to me in the future. Will I be ok? Will I have a good job? a good house? A family?! At this point I rambling about nothing. Bottom line, im too scared to ask for help."

 Nobody cares or tries to understand the loss of men at stalingrad and Eastern front. Memories of WW2 vets are fading with them and no one fucking cares. Its nothing more than another chapter in history for these people. 
Imagine living a life as German soldier, the already bloody war at eastern front and incoming attack from west, you are constantly fighting, no time rest, its been years since you've seen your home for the last time. Once a victorious war machine, now surrounded by enemies. 
No time to relax, fighting day and night, having to see your comrades torn apart before your eyes, always retreating and surrounded.
There's not a single reason to be happy, you can't even cry; you got no time to cry anyway. 
Lost all territores from west to east, millions of lives wasted for.. what?
They're now planning a attack on Germany itself, little to no hope but you still fight to a bitter end. 

All this to be called a Nazi and seen as ""bad guy"". Nobody really appreciates your sacrifice. 75 years later only to get called Nazi again by some random fuckhead on internet.

And yet this isn't the only tragic thing. It is that, We're losing WW2 veterans faster than ever. They are dying quickly. I will never be able to shake hands with any WW2 veteran, its killing me from inside.


ETERNAL GLORY TO EVERY WW2 SOLDIER. YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!! R.I.P"
depression,Is there really purpose in life?,"I don’t think who I am matters but recently I’ve been just thinking about life. Why does life have to be unfair and cruel? Why does life want to make me feel like an anxious piece of shit all the time? Why can’t i be told what to do? I feel so hopeless all the time. I just feel trapped and I can’t shake the feeling off even when around friends. I don’t know what will make me feel better. Maybe I want to start a new life probably go to Canada or something but that’s only a fever dream. I can never do that so I’m trapped here. Wasting my life with jealously and envy. I can’t control these feelings and I don’t wanna keep trying to put my head up and feel better. The world is on fire which doesn’t help at all. I truthfully don’t know why I keep trying, I have no really friends or support. I want to be proud of myself but I just can’t. I hate it here. I hate me."
depression,I almost feel ignored and shoved to the side.,"Protests are going on obviously, not gonna say much else about it other than it’s a generally a good thing most of them are fighting for (holding everyone to the same standards). However I just can’t shrug off the idea that no one even cares about what I have to deal with, a really severe stutter. Then there’s a lot of posts talking to the entire white demographic saying how they’re privileged. I am not fucking privileged man. Every aspect of my life, my stutter has seethed into and made it harder and more heartbreaking. This is not to say I’m glad people are standing up for what’s right or that I would even want a “protest” for stuttering (that could be kind of weird), it’s just a thought that comes up in my mind a lot."
depression,Alone,I know I’m just 16 but every time I watch love movies or shows I just feel broken. The last person I gave that kind of trust to abused me and gaslit me for years. I’m not popular or funny or good looking and I have autism. I feel so unlovable and I know I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life or wind up in an abusive relationship one day because I’m that desperate. I can’t connect to people and that’s going to be my downfall
depression,"I haven’t posted in a long time, but I really need someone right now.","I feel very broken and lost, I tried to give my life to God and change and be a better person. I was able to abandon my addiction for marijuana and the need to numb my pain. I’ve tried to be a better woman, someone who is worthy of being a wife. I’ve tried to show everyone how much I love and care for them and would do anything for them. I’ve feel constantly attacked for my sins and like I’ll never be good enough for anything, anyone, even God if I can’t accept everything the Bible say. I’ve been going to a church where I recommitted to God and learned a lot, but that has also very much hurt me, refused to listen or have a real conversation, and most recently has made me want to leave the faith completely. It seems that I have no where to turn, I don’t want to call a help line rn cause I have too much anxiety to even speak words right now and I am in so much emotional pain. If someone can please reach out to me. Even if it’s just to tell me the simple words I’ll be okay, it would mean a lot. I feel so alone. I feel so helpless. Was this all for nothing? I feel so broken."

depression,Do I want to die or not?,"I don't think I've ever been so confused on how I feel. The last 4 years for me have been a huge struggle, with mental healing and twice as much mental damage. I'm clinically diagnosed with Bipolar depression, general anxiety and PTSD (and don'tget me wrong I'vedealt with this far before this time in my life.) Within the last 4 years ive had my mother choose an abusive man over me, got us evicted from our home overnight and had to move in with a friend whose family I had only met once prior. My father completely cut me off and blame me for the death of my grandmother (we didn't get along so he figured I wanted her to die.) And within this time get into my first serious relationship where I was dumped twice, the first time, the day before a foot surgery that left me unable to walk for 7 months. The second time, the end of last year, a month after our 2 year anniversary, with his ex girlfriend. I had only found out because a mutual friend sent me the screenshots and hotel receipts. Needless to say I stayed.. I have no where to go, no one to talk to and no family to ""burden"". Within these last 4 years I have felt so absolutely worthless and depressed but I'm also so scared of dying. When I get a bad depressive episode I feel like I could finally pull through but I'm too scared to do it, what if it gets better? It's not just relationships and daddy issues, it's  all of the feelings of self loathing, guilt, and worthlessness that has been brought up from it. I just don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry."
depression,been struggling,my depressions been getting worse. i’ve been depressed maybe since I was 6 years old. It’s a mixture of instability in my head and things in the real world. I’ve tried doctors and medications but it doesn’t seem to help. Recently i’ve been having more suicidal thoughts than usual. Today after work I considered just driving off the road and later put a gun to my head. I don’t know. I want to escape from this world

depression,Covid,"I know you all are probably tired of hearing about the pandemic already. 

But I have noticed I do have more than a few symptoms of Covid-19 (missing a few key ones, thankfully)

Some of these being ones that I haven’t even heard until I looked into it. 

And I’m praying that I don’t have it. 

My immune system isn’t the best and it could take me longer to recover than a healthy person.

And I have seen healthy people’s bodies become destroyed by it.

It is said likely that athletes who contract the virus likely won’t be able to compete in their sport anymore. I’m a dancer and it is my whole life, if I have to give that up I won’t have much else to live for. 

It’s likely I’m being a hypochondriac, but I’ve admittedly not been as careful as I should be. Yes, I wear a mask when I go out, I wash my hands and use hand sanitizer frequently, but I haven’t been diligent about not touching items in stores too much and I have always been one to touch my face a lot and it’s a habit I can’t seem to break.

Not only could I lose my livelihood from this, I’ve likely given it to everyone in my house too. 

I don’t know what to do"

depression,is it too late to be aborted?,"the question is obviously rhetorical. 

i would very much like to be dead. i cause so much pain to those around me and i feel like a constant waste of air and space. i feel hopeless. 

it may be because it’s the middle of the night and i’ve kinda been off my meds and haven’t been able to talk to my therapist in months bc of covid-19, but i’m feeling quite hopeless. 

also on a side note (which will probably make you dislike me and even make you agree with why i think i should not be here), i got caught shoplifting food today. about $50 worth of food i didn’t need. i have a $550 fine i have to pay and i have to go to court in october.

depression,"Life is not that short, dont rush things.","Okay so i have this thing on my mind for a while an i thought this would be the right place to share it. Life is not that short, just imagine you are on you early 20s, if you live in a 1st class country you probably lived only 1/4 or 1/5 of you live and all the thing you have lived and experienced were just a tiny part of your life.

Now if you were in a game were you had a human type character lvl 20, still waiting on a class to invest considering all the classes and subclasses and subclasses, if the max lvl is 100, you will probably want to know more about the game and how things works, test out differents builds, metas, environments.

This is how i think things are and this is how i am gonna live my life, discovering the world making new plans and figuring out new stuff.

depression,I don't know. I just feel sad/frustrated all the time.,"Hello everyone,
Let's start with my background.
I am 21M, currently in college. I recently joined my Intern under a reputed MnC. Since I am Indian, this indeed counts as a big deal in our society. Everyone is happy apart from me. I don't feel anything. I don't like the work, I don't like the company, I don't like the environment. I don't even want to continue my education sometimes. I just stare at void, and try to find meaning. I don't feel like there is a meaning to anything at all. Like anything. The world is going through crisis, and people are suffering, and but deep down we know, it's just a phase and everything will be back to normal, and I am afraid of it. I don't want to return to the normal world, and move on with life. The next thing on my already established plan is finding a job, and I already dread it. I don't want it but I cannot say this to anyone. Everyone I have ever talked about this has offered me advice to atleast give it a try, but I don't want to. I also have this insecurity, that if I don't achieve something ""good"" in my life, I will waste my life, and my families expectations. I just want to face the world any more. All I want to be in the little corner of my room and sleep. Sleep and dream. Because as soon as I open my eyes, things become meaningless.

TL;DR : Don't know what I want with life. Don't want to face the world after quarantine. Don't want to interact with anyone in real world, while simultaneously wanting to escape everything."
depression,Why would anyone like me,"I can't even get anyone to be my friend let alone have someone love me. 

I invited people over for drinks and no one came. I think it's because no one really wants to be around me, why would they tbh."

I feel dead inside and that i let down everyone around me, especialky my lecturers. I migh be a retard and i dont want to live anymore, every year its only bad things happening to me and nothing good. Im in dar place."
depression,I’m desperately in love with my best friend.,"I’m desperately in love with my best friend of 6 years, she means the world to me but has made it clear that she wants nothing to do with me if it’s anything more than a friend. She’s one of the main reasons I’m even still alive, she has been there for me at my lowest and Vice versa, I helped her through her mother’s early death due to a genetic disease that she also has. I’ve been he shoulder she cried on when idiot dudes broke  her heart, I’ve even held her close in the night to keep her warm when we went camping. She’s the perfect person for me and my best friend but she wants nothing to do with me. She’s the only one I really have and the main reason I’m still alive. I’m also alone despite having her and my family. It feels like I’ll never be about for anyone when she knows me to my core and doesn’t want me. She’s helped me try and get other girl friends to no avail, one ex even committed suicide after leaving me. Does anybody else have this feeling too? I let seems certain I’ll end up alone and stay by her side for ever regardless."
depression,Started to cry.,"I asked my little brother (21) I’m (26) what symbol he would say represents him if he had that symbol and he sent me a picture. I didn’t know what it was and I was trying to figure it out. After bugging him he told me what it meant, and he said “ it’s the symbol of depression “ and I said are you really depressed and he said yeah I am. And I just started crying. I do so much for that kid I treat him like my son. And I just want him to know how proud I am of a brother and that I love him and he knows that. But I want someone else to show it. I want more people to give this kid a chance and be a true friend someone you can count on. If anyone is depressed you aren’t alone."
depression,Should i call the suicide prevention hotline,"Ive been thinking about killing myself lately I already know when and how im going to do it, but im not sure if I could go through with it. I deserve it ive done so many bad things in my life things that can't be forgiven. And ive been feeling empty like something is missing in my life like nothing in my life will get better. I feel invisible when im around people and just want a friend or someone to hug. I just want to feel something other then this numbness."
depression,My fault,"I’ve spent years of my life being depressed. I grew up in a household with a schizophrenic mother and she was very unsteady for most of my childhood. It took its toll on me. It was very upsetting to see someone go down such a path like that. Especially at such a young age it was brutal because I loved my mom more than anyone. I felt terrible during this time and it lead to me becoming depressed. I moved on to high school and began to hide these problems under alcohol and weed. During this time I spent trying to get with girls and trying to become popular just so my life seemed normal, so I seemed normal to myself. I found a girl my senior year of high school and I fell in love with her and I was able to talk to her. I was able to be myself and be happy and talk about these problems that had haunted me for years. Me and her had our ups and downs. I had bad bouts of depression and bad anxiety. As we kept dating I felt less and less that I could talk to her and I began to hold everything in. I became severely depressed and everyday was another fight to be myself. We soon both moved on to college and we went to different schools. This put a really bad strain on our relationship. We broke up soon after and I made a mistake. I had sex with one of her close friends. We were both very drunk and we said we didn’t want to talk about it or tell my ex. After this I fell into a deep depression and had constant panic attacks and began to fall deeper and deeper into my depression and myself. I became severely depressed and introverted. I wasn’t able to talk to people and I stopped going to class and talking to close friends. My ex came to my school for one weekend and saw each other at a party and began to talk again and she came back to my place and we started back dating. We ended up being okay and at the time we really needed each other. We kept dating for a while. I hid the fact that I had sex with her best friend. It took a terrible toll on me and I knew I couldn’t fully love her and be a good boyfriend without telling her the truth. Recently I did and she of course broke up with me. The last 2 weeks of my life have been hell due to it. I’ve begun heavily drinking and have started using cocaine and marijuana to try to hide it all. I can’t eat without becoming nauseated because I’ve been drinking so heavily. Being alone is terrifying because I can’t think about what I did to a person I loved so much. I can’t deal with the fact I hurt the person I loved so much. I don’t want to be depressed like this I don’t want to have to face my reality. I don’t know what I hope to gain from writing this. I don’t know what to do I feel like I’m staring insurmountable wall."
depression,I'm not ok,"I don't even know where to start. 2020 has been nothing but a shitshow. Since February I have:

-Lost my job
-Moved to a different country suddenly due to coronavirus and I miss it terribly (I can't go back because of coronavirus, Americans are currently not allowed in)
- Contracted an STD from a lying ex (thankfully it was treated but still)
-Put up with going from being an independent adult to being stuck in my parents' house temporarily. They are both also depressed for different reasons and we agree on nothing politically or religiously. 
Things came to a head two days ago and my mother called me a bitch because of my political opinion on Facebook and told me to leave. I spent the night at my cousin's house and am now back at my parents' until the 14th when I will move to a ideal but acceptable place to get away. 
-Started talking to a guy who acted interested in me romantically but was lying. We ended up having sex without a condom so now I have to worry about STDs again until I get tested

Despite being 31 years old, I constantly seek male validation and commit the same errors over and over, allowing myself to be used and hurt by men. I'm an only child, my parents are old, and I desperately want a relationship and assurance that I won't be alone. 

This fear is what led me to keep talking to the lying, cheating ex who wasted 2 years of my life because I guess being abused is less scary than being alone. I just now blocked him after he made me cry and I hate the fact that I'm burning a bridge.

Men don't want a depressed woman and I don't blame them. So I keep accepting short-term attention from men who just want sex even though that's not what I want because that's probably all I can get.

I know I will have my own apartment soon and I'm starting a new job in two weeks, but I don't feel excited. I feel utterly hopeless, tired, and wishing I had never been born. Everyone in my family is fighting due to the current political tension. I don't know what to do. 

I suppose I need counseling to address my unhealthy focus on men/relationships and everything else, but I've never had any luck with therapy in the past.

I was taking antidepressants for the past ten years or so off and on. I am currently not on them and don't relish the thought of having to take them forever.

Thank you for reading."
depression,I dont deserve a good life,"For reference, I'm 21F Indian expat living in the middle east. 

I feel so inadequate despite having all the necessities. I have a roof over my head. I have food in the fridge. I have gaming devices, a smartphone and a really good laptop to do programming with. Yet, I feel so inadequate. Yesterday, I sat down to meditate in order to ponder what has been bothering me these past few months. These are the moments that open the floodgates of tears:

1. I didn't have a good childhood. Not in the physical or emotional sense but in the social sense. As my name suggests, I'm a tomboy that didn't get along with the other girls in class during middle school (this is a gender segregated school for reference). In elementary school, I was a massive cry baby over small instances like my socks being the wrong color, my skirt was too tight. I also felt entitled over having friends and would complain to my teacher if someone didn't become my friend. The problem was that I had OCD. In middle-school I developed crippling social-anxiety.
2. I fucked up my high school years. Till the 10th grade, I was able to cruise through classes without any effort. Everyone praised me, I was smart and intelligent. Then I couldn't understand a lot of the 11th and 12th grade material and I ended up getting a 75/100 in the 12th grade, a large change from my 98/100 10th grade. My world crashed. I was told that I had a high IQ and all that. I didn't study for my finals because I was so stressed with exam anxiety. I was scared to put in the effort to study because I thought I wouldn't get a high grade because in actuality I was stupid and not intelligent.
3. I didn't do much in college even when I could have. I was focused on getting a 9+ CGPA (out of 10) as a way of redeeming my 12th grade marks. I focused a lot on classes and attending lots of clubs which eventually broke me. At the end of it, I got my 9+ CGPA but I barely did programming outside of classes. I feel so ashamed trying to do basic programming tutorials now when I should be doing big projects. I look at some of peers getting into BIG 4 companies. They're smart. Have CGPAs bigger than mine and have impressive projects. I feel like I can never catch up to them. I'm paralyzed everytime I open the code editor.
4. I over-promised on projects and on my thesis, didn't deliver and begged my way to finishing it. My most recent and embarrassing experience is that I did 3 projects (in machine learning) during my bachelors and I over-promised on all three to my advisors because I didn't want to disappoint them. My thesis advisor threatened to drop me because I was unable to fulfill the promises that I first made. They kept me and I was able to finish it and I still work with them now. I'm so ashamed of it still after 6 months and I still can't sleep over it.
5. I was supposed to go abroad for grad school (masters) this Fall but the covid has put that on pause. I've been dropping into periods of depression. I sleep all day. I can't type a line of code because I'm paralyzed by it being too simple and not a huge ass revolutionary project. I realized that I barely know the proper math in my preferred field (machine learning). I thought that I could use the gap well and study for it in preparation for research. But I'm so scared of putting in the effort and failing. I got into a good grad program but I fall into depression when I see my peer get into a higher ranked program. ""That could have been me. I didn't try hard enough. Why didn't I try a bit harder? Because I thought that my skills weren't good. Why didn't I try to improve my skills? Well somebody can do the job better than me. Why should I try and disappoint myself by failing? I could do it but I'm scared to put in that effort."" 

My depressive episodes can be summarized into the following ""I'm not somebody special. I'm not Steve Jobs or Albert Einstein. My peers can fill the role of 'special'. So why should I bother trying when someone else can do it. I might end up failing and falling to the ground. I don't deserve to even exist. I'm not as smart as I thought. I'm afraid of putting in the effort to make myself better.""

Thanks for reading till here."
depression,Back on my bullshit,"Tl;dr: I had bad depression for a while, had a relatively depression-free period of about 6 months, and am now feeling hopeless and depressed again. It sucks.

I guess I just need to talk, I havent talked about anything in a while. I feel like maybe I should go to therapy again, but at the same time that idea scares me. What if I cant find a good fit? What if I do, and then they get a new job; like all my therapists before?

But anyway

This all started when I was 12, I started feeling very angry and/or sad all the time. I had voices in my head that would constantly be saying bad things to me about my worth and tell me lies about how people around me perceived me. I was very paranoid and scared of the world, I didnt have many friends at school because I just didnt talk to anyone. I was so insecure that I just assumed they wouldnt like me. I did also get picked on a bit, so that definitely didnt help.

Sorry I'm rambling. I didnt know what was going on with me, I thought maybe I was schizoaffective, bpd, bipolar, or something else (I was a young teenager, give me a break for thinking this). But I didnt know. I just thought I was crazy. I kept it all mostly to myself with very few exceptions, out of fear of being thrown into a mental hospital or being told something I didnt want to hear

Eventually I did find my way to therapy (after 3 and a half years suffering largely alone) and it helped. A lot. I'm very thankful that I had the opportunity to go. Over time, a period of about 4 more years, and after meeting somebody great whom I love very much; for the first time I could remember I felt happy. Genuinely happy.

We live together, he's the perfect boyfriend, we have 2 cats who I love very much. I have a job, that I hate, but I'm grateful to have a job. My life has relatively low stress, honestly. We make enough to pay our bills, my job sucks but it is easy, I dont have family drama right now or anything. So why am i suddenly slipping again?

I know it must be related to what's going on in the world, of course. But I worry. I just worry so much. I've been doing so well and I worry that if I fall hard now, who knows how long it will take me to get back up? 

What if me having a meltdown ruins my relationship? I love my boyfriend so much, we havent been together for very long though so he hasn't really seen this depressed side of me (a little over a year, we kinda had to rush into moving in together due to extreme circumstances, but like I said it's been great). I think that he would understand and be there for me the best he could, I just worry because when I get sad, he gets sad as well.

He starts saying that he feels bad that he cant make me feel better, and that he feels like a bad boyfriend because I'm sad. I've told him so many times how happy he makes me, that he's the best guy I've ever been with and he treats me so well, I have no complaints. He says he knows.

I just, I dont know what to do. I cant talk to him about it without feeling guilty, i dont want to make him sad. I'm terrified to go to therapy again and once again be thrust in to a new search as soon as I get comfortable with one. 

I just needed to get some shit out of my head I guess, thanks for listening if you did."
depression,I always seem to get cheated on no matter what,"I have been cheated on 3 times. Right as I get attached to my partner, she either breaks up with me or cheats on me. I know that this is nothing out of the ordinary compared to a lot of other things people go through, but it still hurts.
This recent relationship I was in, I was infatuated with her, and I thought she loved me back, but later I found out that she cheated on me. Five days after my birthday she broke up with me. A few days after that, I heard from a friend of hers that she cheated on me. I never found out about it when I was in the relationship, but I was still sad about our relationship ending when I learned. She cheated on me with her ex. They “hung out” every weekend. One time me, her, and her friend were on FaceTime and her friend mentioned the guy, and my gf panicked and basically told her friend to be quiet right in front of me, I was suspicious, but I didn’t want to be annoying and say that she can’t have any guy friends. This time it was really depressing, I thought she was different. I felt something special with her. I’ve been cheated on many times, I feel like I’m doing something wrong. Am I mistreating them. I don’t abuse them, I don’t insult them, I feel like I’m pretty nice to them. This is only one of the reasons I feel depressed. I hate to say this, but I’ve never been diagnosed with depression by a doctor. No one knows that I have depression. But I’m pretty sure I have it. I promise I’m not one of those “fake depression” people. I don’t think anyone that I know personally would care if I said I think I have depression. I’m sorry if this was too long to read, I just wanna vent somewhere. I don’t have anyone to talk too. If you did read this, then thank you, I really do appreciate it."
depression,"So apparently my brother has ""Catatonic Schizophrenia"" and idk how to process it..",I don't really know how to take it in.. It's making me lose my own mind thinking about it tbh.

depression,"Just trying to put a smile on people's faces just goes...badly, i shouldnt be here, nobody wants me here"," Its  amazing the lengths a few people have gone to ruin my life, ive tried  to be a good uplifting guy, at my job there has been someone to actively  make an effort to ruin my reputation, in my personal life my neighbor  to air out my personal life to everyone and anyone , everywhere i turn i  overhear shit talking about me, i hear all of it....i'm so tired of  trying to be the positive guy...i just want to make people around me  happy but people seemingly fight against my good attitude...i literally  had a peer of mine talk terribly about me for everything i did, worst  part of it all is the guy he talked to was my boss and my companies hr  rep...i dont want to be here anymore, i hurt...despite all my attempts  at bettering myself and actively working to better my environments there  is always someone to seeming work against me... i was fired  unexpectedly from my last job and spent about 6 months homeless..my  current job ive already seen someone to nitpick everything about me,  saying I'm a weird guy and why did we hire him...what's wrong with me."

depression,So this is about me I guess,Just to start off if my grammar is horrendous then I'm sorry I have dyslexia and sometimes mess up a ton. So I'm adam and today I'm gonna type up everything on my chest okay. So since I was born I never felt like i was like by my father or mother. My dad would drink alot and my mum would pick fights with my dad and it would be me as a child having to then cope with my father's anger as he would lash out and attack me. So when I turned 17 my dad did a DNA test and it turns out he wasnt my father this was my dream as a kid as he was a douche. But at this time he and my mum where divorced and he was a changed man. I was 16 when I first started taking anti depressants and I'm know 25 and still taking them. Yeah I'm sorry this is long but still. I also hate the way I look too I've never felt good enough for anyone and never feel like I will. I just feel alone alot of the time and well I've been taken to hospital after having a overdose and just life is just hard I guess theres plenty more about my life I'll post one day too

depression,Every friendship I have ends with them just using me,"Several months ago, my bestfriend of 15yrs begged me for rent and gas money and then I found out she blew it on concert tickets the same night I lent the money to her.
I never told her that I found this out. I just got really distant towards her. 

We were very close and she was like my sister at one point. Then our relationship devolved into her only contacting me when she wanted something from me. Always spins some sob story or makes herself look like a victim before asking me for money. 
It's just unbelievable what an entitled and lying piece of shit she is.
She messaged me out of the blue recently to tell me she can't pay the penalty for keeping a dog hidden from her landlord. Well tough fucking shit!

Honestly, every friendship I have seems to end with them taking advantage of me. Do I just have a knack for attracting scumbags?

 I'm so lonely and tired of this life. The only person I truly care about now is my mother and when she's gone someday, I'll have no reason to go on."
depression,.,"idk how to describe this, but do u ever just feel okay/numb and then u just get random suicidal thoughts? or even just bursts of sadness along with intense chest pain and the need to cry?"
depression,I keep breaking down and I dont think I'm strong enough,"I (17f) worry so much about how my depression effects my loved ones, my boyfriend (17m) in particular. He said to me recently that he feels he doesnt make me happy and I dont know what to do. I love him so much and he does make me happy but I cabt be happy.

I really want to be happy every time I'm with him because I want to show him how much he does for me by just being mine but I can't. I feel so hopeless.

I break down almost every day, and it really hurts me. I'm also an addict, addicted to opioids, tramadol in particular. I would rather be numb and happy some, rather than just feeling pathetic and weak all the time. 

I hate the way I am, I have tried killing myself but I just cant, I know people will grieve for me, I'll be ruining some peoples lives. It feels wrong. My boyfriend worries about me killing myself, I wish he didnt have to. 

I dont expect much from making this post, I expect nothing. I just thought, after making my post about my addiction before, that I should also come to terms with the effect I have on the people around me. The people I love.

I love them so much, I just cant show it"

depression,my lover’s friend died,"and although my heart goes to him and I feel sad about it, especially because my lover donated blood to him just last week, but I’m also jealous. jealous because his friend is dead and I’m alive. I’m been on the brink of suicide for months, but I’m too cowardly. his friend is gone just like that, but I remain. and...I think I’m also jealous because he cares so much for the loss of his friend, and that’s the kind of care I’ve always wanted to feel. he’s of course sad, taking the day for himself and dealing with the tragedy, and it just makes me wish i could receive that type of caring and loving. if I ever did kill myself, it would suck because then I’d never be able to see that *anyone* actually cares. I hate being alive and I’m jealous that his friend is dead. I know this sounds super scummy and selfish, and this isn’t a good reflection of who I really am, but I guess deep down this is a part of me."
depression,I'm completely exhausted and seriously considering suicide.,"Earlier, it used to be flashing vivid images of me slitting my wrists. But now it is an organised thought. Yesterday, I even decided to write my letter. It gets worse everyday and I just can't cope. The worst thing about depression is that it will almost never kill you. So this terrible pain will continue and perhaps grow stronger. I'm hopeless and just want all of this to end."

depression,I wish the world was different,"I feel so much despair and hopeless regarding the state of humanity. People will choose to see themselves as good above everything. They will justify the cruelty they conduct by telling themselves “they deserved it”. All of the prejudices and separation in the world makes me feel really, really sad. It hurts that many men perceive women as animated objects who’s only value is her sexuality. Sorry if it’s controversial to say such a thing but it’s just so depressing. I hate that people judge another person negativity based on the colour of their skin, their appearance, age, sexual orientation, culture, socio-economic status or income. I hate how people are so superficial and ignorant. It’s really awful when people don’t even love their own children. One day everyone on earth will have empathy and compassion, if not hopefully we go extinct soon. I know I’m just some nobody with mainstream opinions but there’s just so much pain and injustice in the world and I can’t do anything about it. I just want to protect all of the innocent people and children before they are exposed to the cruelty this world exhibits. I want to create a utopia for all the sensitive and kind hearted people. I can’t stop feeling all of this pain. I feel like apologising on behalf of other people’s behaviour and choices. I’m sorry. I’m sorry life as a human isn’t what you expected as a child, I’m sorry you had to be exposed to this world. I’m sorry to all of the animals who are exploited and treated with such cruelty. I’m so sorry. I love you."

depression,Life ain’t fun. Identity issues (anxiety and depression),"I don’t know where to start. I struggle with severe ocd, social phobia and agoraphobia. Currently I’m in therapy for it, but the way I feel isn’t improving really. I start to feel more depressed. I can’t do literally anything without worrying. I’m constantly afraid of being a bad person. I’ve got intrusive thoughts (ocd) which is giving me lots of anxiety. Every thought and feeling got scanned for danger. I feel constantly stressed about this. I don’t know who I am anymore and what I can trust and not. I can’t even enjoy music or watching a movie because of this. 

My life is one big mess and I honestly don’t know if I can ever feel fine. I’m not asking much, I don’t want a big house and a fancy watch. I don’t care about anything materialistic. I just want to be okay with my personality. I don’t love myself at all. I want to feel.. Normal.. I just feel so out of place. Derealization doesn’t help with this either. 

My emotions feels very unbalanced. Every emotion I feel gives me anxiety. I can’t open myself to it. It’s super frustrating. Everything feels intense. Nobody understands me. My perception of the world seems strange. I just honestly don’t know it anymore."

Shes also depressed just like i am and she keeps on saying to me that she doesnt care anymore about anything, she wants to die and i wanted to help her. But because of how i am, i just made her worse and said she doesnt want to talk anymore. I just want to kill myself because of how useless i am. The person i wanted to help the most, is also the person ive hurt the most. I just want to die but im also feeling guilty that if i die, ill never see her again. I just want to dissappear and erase my existence to this world and in others memories"
depression,Depression destroyed my head,"I can't think rationally anymore. Depression has made irreversible changes in my head, which is why I have trouble establishing normal relationships.

He was the wonder kid

Who Excelled in everything

He was the one who did 

anything 

Just because.

He had no fear 

But 

Outside the applause

when the curtains were drawn

He wanted more.

Never happy with himself

Because of the crowd at home 

""give up'' ""you're not good enough.""

He's tough 

but 

took those words to heart.

""I'm not good enough""

He said it everyday 

worked so hard and
trained

he 'was' dedicated

But it wasnt from
A passion in his veins.

it was obsession.

Cause all he was searching for was 
perfection.

And what happened 
When he Realised 
That he couldn't get it?

Well,
He hit depression.

afraid to fall Short of expectations

He stopped the path to greatness

Cause he felt anxious

All the praise

All the hate 

Got to his head 

To late for saving.

Cause that boy's 
already dead."
depression,I can't trust the happiness,"Things have been going good for me lately, but I keep thinking something's going to go terribly wrong and I'll end up spiralling again. It seems as if the good things that have happened are a fluke, and I don't deserve them, and soon everything is going to be ripped away from me. For the first time in years, I have experienced unburdened happiness. But the doubt is creeping in.

depression,I[23M] wish I wasn't depressed,"I wish I wasn't depressed. I sit here on this beautiful sandy beach that's only 20 min from my comfortable apartment that is also close to my very well paying job, and all I can think about is how I'm not happy. 


I see all these young happy people on the beach this morning and can only imagine how it must feel to actively want what's best for yourself and to actually to take the steps to reach your goals. 


I have a full stomach, a roof over my head, and friends who love and care about me, but all I can think about is how I'm truely alone and not happy.


Im currently in school to be able go back to my dream school that I failed out of when I was younger and I'm acing all my classes, but all I can think about is how I missed out on the formative experience of being young and in college.


I go to therapy where my therapist tells me that I have nothing to worry about when it comes to finding a partner and that I -am- working on getting myself better, but all I feel is that I'm not doing enough and that I will have to get extremely lucky to find someone who wants to be close with me. 


I wish I didn't have major depression, maybe then I could go on and actually have hobbies, have a life, and have a girlfriend, but instead I feel trapped behind this invisible wall, not able to be a part of -that- life. 


I've felt actually happy and content before, this was with my last girlfriend, who through me not following my heart and basing some major decision choices on what other people wanted me to do, ended up leaving me. 


I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to try to get better. I don't see a use in it."
depression,Just venting I think,"Sorry if this isn't how this page is supposed to be used. I honestly just need somewhere to write this all out. I'm not even sure I'm looking for guidance or anything more then to just write my story out. 

Where do I begin. I have this long backstory of tragedy of youth between losing my mother at 9 or my uncle to suicide at 18. Or recently my grandfather  and the fact I have no family left locally or even regionally anymore.

But is that even what I need to write. So I had a decent job last year. Nothing to wild, ran a restaurant and had salary and great hours. Plenty of money. Had an apartment and car is paid off so everything seemed great. Had some old debt I planned to eventually take care and needed to handle a medical bill but I had plans in the near future to handle it. Then came the decision to change jobs for what I thought would be better. Only it really went badly. I walked out before finishing my 2 weeks because my grandfather broke his back in Florida and was barely alive so I panicked and drove down there. So I burned that bridge with that employer of 5 years. I had time because I planned to take 2 weeks off before starting my new job. It quickly fell through due to poor upper management and misjudments on mass hiring. 
So suddenly I was without a job and still dealing with family issues. This was around Christmas and I applied at more places than I can imagine but all the places were cutting their seasonal help. I got on with uber eats and it wasn't too bad. However I ended up with a leak in the coolant hose. Took a bit to fix and some funds I didn't immediately have so that began the financial mess. 

Finally after some got it taken care of and was back to getting some income however not great. Then we had covid come about and that destroyed the local market. Suddenly it went from 10 local people delivering to the entire town to make quick money. I was barely making anything and unable to get unemployment. My roommate didn't want to resign and I was unable to find anyone to take his spot so I was unable to keep living in the apartment. Now due to the unfortunate financial issues and work I dont have 2 months of paystubs to show the ability to rent from anywhere around me. So as of May 4th I've been homeless, without stable work. Forgot to mention my car has a new leak and overheats but I can't afford repairs or to keep buying coolant every day so I'm resorting to water( i know how bad it is but its that or I have no vehicle at all). So I haven't been doing delivery lately due to concern of it overheating and getting worse. 

I was able to get a motel voucher for a month that ends June 18th. Then I'm back to living in my car. Food pantries will let me get a box once a week but most of it is stovetop or requires a can opener which I don't have. My last money is going to gas for work.
Thankfully I got a job at a company starting Monday but its a 30 minute drive from here and I'm hoping to have gas til I get paid. But the other issue is my account is overdrawn so I'm behind to start. I owe 2 months phone bill and its required for uber eats as well as my new job. Irony is having its way with me it seems. And to top it all off I met a girl online last year playing games and we kind of had a light thing going. I got way too emotionally attached and she acted as if she was. But now in my worst moments she is just dragging me around and playing games. 

Its just one thing leading to another. I went from a great job and planning to get a house soon and living a great life to a couple little things snowballing into me being homeless, broke, hungry and possibly unable to fix alot of it. In constantly just asking myself if this is what life is. Just the constant act of picking the balls up and dropping them over and over again until we die. 

I'm sorry for how long this is. I doubt anyone even reads these. Especially something this long. Im not looking for anything. Not even sure why I'm writing all this. I just needed to vent and ramble and let everything out to try and make sense of my own mess of a life. I hope everyone else here is having a better time. But its the depression page so I doubt it."

depression,My head never lets go of its regrets.,"It kills me inside. When you are absurdly bent on self perfection - self conscious to a fault, a pure dysfunction - screwing up destroys you. 

*And I thought I had protected myself from failure so well! I've overthought every single avenue in this ordeal!* But regardless, human error makes its flashy entrance. 

I think of people in my past that I've acted immaturely or rudely to. People you strive for acceptance from. Then.. it ends on bad terms. Your ego screams out to you, begging on resolution to a disturbed former peace. It's more of a selfish sentiment than an altruistic one - your damaged self can't take being seen in a negative light by someone you might look fondly upon.

Where do we go from here? Distance, of course! Health is moving forward, striving for a future, whether that means leaving behind people that do not fit your world or not. And in this world, things can't be fixed. You've always got to look forward.

But it hurts me knowing I can never go back. I will never come back with the intent of a bruised ego, trying to gain grounds I've lost. I don't want to disturb anyone with our revitalized conflicts - health for both parties is growing and leaving it behind. If it was welcomed I would gladly. But that's just something you can't trust in.

Perhaps time will heal, but the regret always seems to linger. It hurts me but I know we all move forward - together or alone."

depression,I've been wanting to visit a Psychiatrist,"But I'm too afraid, I don't know why. Should I still go visit?"
depression,I don't know how to let people help me.,"I really don't know what my parents mean when they say they want to help me. They kicked me out last year by raising my rent $50 every month until I couldn't live there anymore. I'm on disability on a fixed income. I have been on and off medication. Everything is so expensive just to live. I'm barely getting by financially. I have to start working or I will be homeless soon. Every time I think about working I immediately want to kill myself. I feel so physically weak all the time. I stay in bed most days. Went through mania a couple of days ago and am recovering from that. I have no fucking clue how to care for myself when I am depressed. It's just too heavy and I just want everything to go away. I don't know how I am supposed to get better when I have no money. How I'm supposed to work through this depression and function at a job when I can barely like feed myself most days. I'm really just thinking out loud. Nobody I know actually understands how bad my depression gets. They are always trying to push me forward out of it. I think I just want someone to listen instead of tell me what I'm supposed to be doing. I have one friend, but he doesn't like hearing about the suicidal ideation. My parents want me to get better, of course I want to get better. Nobody wants to be depressed. I want to be happy like normal people. Or at least not want to die every day. I'm struggling. I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't think there's really anywhere else to post something like this. Thanks."

The only thing that brings me genuine joy is talking to and playing games with my friends, and with my computer starting to get old it's hard to do a lot of things with them so that's why I made that goal. Those friends and my dog are the only thing keeping me alive aside from the guilt I'd feel doing something so horrible to my family. But even when I'm doing things with those friends that feeling of being punched in the gut by whatever decides to mentally torture me still comes and goes. Idek how I'd off myself.

depression,Self harmed for the first time in years while drunk,"Hey guys. This happened Friday night which was 2 (1?) nights ago. So I(F22) noticed I’d been feeling depressed about 3 weeks ago. Looking back I can see now that I was going through it even before then but I barely picked up on why I was feeling so down a few weeks ago. 

I went to a psychiatrist last summer and the issues I went to speak to him about primarily were about my sleeping problems and my anxiety. I was put on Lexapro but then I finished my first prescription and never went back for a refill. As for the sleeping pills I was put on Trazadone and I would take them on and off as needed. So I haven’t been on any meds recently because I stopped taking the Lexapro and I haven’t taken a sleeping pill in a couple of months now. I’ve been on the pill for almost 3 years now as well but I did switch brands in March because of my insurance. I never really had any mood swings on the first brand I was on so I’m hoping the cause of all this is this new brand of birth control. 

I only have one more week on it then I’m gonna finish it. Also COVID has taken a toll on my mental health because I really haven’t been able to go out at all because I live with my grandma and I’ve been extra cautious cuz I don’t want to get her sick. So I’ve been stuck at home for a few months. I went on a walk the other day and I thought it’d help clear my head but I still felt like shit that night. My state has recently moved into Phase 3 so I decided to go see my friends on Friday. 

I basically spent all day with them and we had a really good time but I did drink a few glasses of cranberry vodkas and by the time I got home I was a little bit past tipsy. I started texting my bf(21M) and then I started going through my camera roll and I accidentally sent him a screenshot of this guy sexting me that I’d originally saved to show my girlfriends. My bf and I have been on and off for about 3 years so that’s why it was recently in my camera roll and we barely got together like 2 months ago again. I think I was trying to send him a meme or something and that ss happened to be next to whatever I was trying to send him and unfortunately I didn’t notice until it was too late. I’ve also been sad about the relationship because it in itself is very toxic and has been for a while and it’s been really hard for me to let go of it. 

And I’ve gained a lot of weight since we’ve been dating. I’ve gained about 50-75 pounds in the past 3 years and it sucks. So when I sent him the screenshot I started reading what it was and I got really panicky because I knew he was gonna pissed, obviously. So then I started apologizing as much as I could and I don’t know why that was what tipped me over the edge but I think I also just needed an excuse to cut myself and I felt like shit so I cut twice on my thigh. I don’t know what’s wrong with me or why I’ve been the way that I am and I don’t know how to get better. 

I don’t want to feel this way anymore. The last time I felt this sad was when I was living with my parents and had to deal with them being controlling and overboard with everything, which is why I started cutting in the first place when I was 15 or so. Although I do remember having a diary when I was 12 and one of my first entries was me talking about how I was sad and wished I could die or that things could get better so I think I’ve had this problem for a while. I took like 3 quizzes online too and I don’t know how accurate they are but they all suggested I have moderate depression."

That's the reason I texted them after leaving anyways, I left barley any work for them (5min maybe) but it was still an obvious dick move, but the real reason I got heated enough for that to matter is because my boss pretends to be my friend because she sees me as a psycho and I overheard her telling him about that today like she constantly does, and i try and let it go but today is the day they together leave a fuck you for me. I cant tell if Im the one making this all up. I cant tell if my self doubt and self loathing are whats going on or if Im acting like a person and her telling me one thing while telling everyone else something else just makes me feel crazy or I really am or ugh!! I cant tell if Im seeing how oyher people see me or if thats who I really am. Now i just want to hurt myself by throwing away and or burn ary stuff i was working on. By posting this instead of working on my hobby ive been looking forward to all day. And I dont know what tomorrow will bring.

I want her to get help but I don’t know how to tell her, the ways she is acting is having a impact on me and our children and I’m worried if I try to explain she will feel I am ‘getting at her’ and she won’t talk to me.

A bit of context; my wife and I have been together for 12 years this year, married for 8 and we have three children (6, 4 and 19 months). Life is tough sometimes but not unmanageable. I earn a decent income and she works part time and together we have enough to live in a nice area, in a fair sized two bed maisonette, pay for our girls to attend extra- curricular activities (one does gymnastics, one ballet and my little one was in baby sensory group) as well as doing the occasional day out and so on. We are by no means hard up. 
However, my wife struggles with loneliness; she only has one real friend and a sister to who she is very close (we live near them luckily) and since the lockdown started she hasn’t seen her friend at all and apart from the occasional visit to see her sister and her kids my wife hasn’t been anywhere or done anything.

I should mention that she is now 35 weeks pregnant with our fourth child and so has been furloughed until her maternity starts. Her depression is always worst whilst she is pregnant and the timing of this lockdown has amplified things ten fold. We never planned to have four children; we always talked about wanting two but a few years after having our second she became broody and after some convincing we agreed to have another. Then last November on my little ones first birthday we found out she was pregnant again, this time by accident. I was adamant we should not have a fourth because she was already struggling to manage with three kids (physically and mentally) and I felt this would be too hard for her, however she could not bring herself to terminate. I wanted to respect her feelings and not force her to do anything I allowed her to make the decision.

I hold no ill will towards her or my unborn child – I love my wife immensely and all of my children.

But now we are where we are; exactly where I feared we would be. My wife is severely depressed, she tells me “I cant  cope anymore” and “I’m going to have a breakdown”, but I think she already has had a breakdown.

She calls me at work asking me to come home because she can’t do something relatively simple. I just had 5 missed consecutive calls (I was at work unable to answer instantly) and when I called back less than 2 minutes later she was both furious and upset that she couldn’t put our stroller up after it had been folded down recently.

On this call she screamed at me, screamed at the kids, swore at me , swore at the kids, cried, told me “I’m going to fucking kill myself” twice before eventually managing to get the stroller put up. This is not unusual (including the “I’m gonna kill myself” line) but its becoming more regular.

I don’t believe she is genuine when she talks about killing herself; she has no history of self abuse of any kind, has never been abused by someone, loves her children despite her actions and that’s not to mention she is currently pregnant. But I am scared and worried and want to help her but do not know how. Please help me."
depression,Physical and mental abuse,"It’s really sad that I’m even dealing with this, but I just feel stuck because the police never help me ive called before more than once they never do anything.. I get black mailed, constantly mentally abused, physically abused.. get my expensive things broken and never replaced.. made feel worthless everyday, constantly being told I’m nothing etc. constantly being threatened to be kicked out while I’m at work , threatened that I have to sleep In my car out of nowhere in the middle of the night, constantly being  Verbally attacked for no reason every single day. Never feel loved etc. never feel like I’m being listened to, no one ever taking any interest  in my life etc..  eh y’all know how it goes 😔 I’m just really tired now and wish I could leave without being threatened and blackmailed and scared that I’ll be alone and not be able to find happiness no matter what.. I use to be homeless and without a job when I got with him but now I have a job again and I can leave and find my own place but leaving this place isn’t so easy.. it’s like I’m trapped here or held hostage or something 😔..... I’m in the Bay Area if anyone cared to know. I’m really so tired and just want to leave.... it makes me so sad to know that the only reason why I’m even dealing with this is because my family never loved or cared about my existence and never provided a true home for me so now that  I’m an adult I just have to struggle and get treated like garbage by bad  people"
depression,If it wasn't for music and books I'd probably be dead,"The only 2 things that I still relatively enjoy. I don't know why but when I get those extreme sadness episodes, immersing myself in a book or a song makes everything slightly less sad"
depression,I feel so lonely recently,"Im just lonely.

I know procrastinating is bad for me, but thats why I do it. I want to hurt myself.

But honestly: fuck that.

If I want to hurt myself I can go beyond my physical limits instead of hurting me mentally. 

I can work out and stretch myself. I can do my work. I can do anything."
depression,I cant keep a job because of my depression and loneliness,"For the first time im not posting something to vent. I would really need some sort of advice.

Thank you in advance."
depression,I hate myself for the time I wasted.,"I wasted too much time. It took me 6 years to finish college. I was told by my English professor that I was not in my right state of mind to enroll in her class and just show up after final exam. I was absent for more than half of the semester. She didn't know that her rejecting my thesis statement proposal pushed me to a deep cliff. And I hate myself even more because I didn't know WHY I DID THAT. I didn't know why I did that ... I didn't know and because of that I have no one to blame but myself. And I hate myself even more.

Now, I have a full-time job. I should be contented but I'm not.  As a finance graduate, I know that time is money. In a span of 2 years, I could have saved a large sum of money and could have lavishly spend it on my family. I'm earning, yes, but I hate myself for spending money on myself, for myself. I don't hate my job. I don't know if I like it either. The moment I start working, I can already feel the heaviness on my shoulder and my back starts to ache with a dull pressure from my forehead down to my neck. And when my other co-worker complains about backaches, I feel like I'm faking my pain, my feeling. I don't know. I don't know. Please, I don't know. I'm tired."
depression,"Just a tiny little thing will set it off, my life is shit in every way","I was just trying to get my bank card working when something went wrong, now I've spiralled back down to realizing I'm stupid, worthless and unwanted. I'm actually scared to do anything wrong in case I set it off. My life is so shit."
depression,Opinions on fluoxetine?,"I take fluoxetine and honestly I fucking hate it. Whenever I take it, I feel numb and so much worse. It's like my depression multiplies. I'm not sure if I get side effects because of my age(12) or that's just what happens to anyone. I can't stand taking them."
depression,Mildly depressed person seeking advice,"hi guys first time to post here, im 25M been mildly depressed since uni days, but manage to pull through and got a work. been working for 2.5 years but i hate every minute of it with my very soul argh. I cant do suicide cause im to scared and my mom need me. ive been thinking of quiting the job and take a gap year to relax  and hopefully fix myself. should i do it? am i become a complete failure when quiting? its seems like the world judge me if i dont have a job and scared that i go deeper into depression..."
depression,This place is really unhealthy. I'm out.,"Every other post and the ones that get most upvotes are about suicide and self harm. 

There's nothing in the way of self help here. 

It's not helpful for my depression at all. 

If anyone has any suggestions for a more forward thinking and constructive sub it's gratefully received."
depression,To anyone that could possibly give advice.,"i don’t have excitement or drive/motivation to get up in the morning anymore. Throughout my whole life this feeling would just sink in silently at random points. I feel like I can’t talk to a single soul because I sometimes switch personalities/emotions that don’t feel the same. Sometimes I feel like I’m grateful for life, sometimes I feel nothing, sometimes I feel like a king who deserves more, and then sometimes I feel like a worthless human being (a topic for a deeper discussion). My favorite one is when I finally can feel emotions for things.... like I become the most intense empath . Most of time lately i just have been getting through “it” day by day with a smile on my face. Hate it here though and I lie awake every night staring at the dark. No one asks if I’m ok. Not one person would suspect a thing is wrong. What is wrong with me? Sometime I microdose drugs when I need to interact with other people. It’s the only way I can even wear a “mask” anymore. Otherwise I’d just come off as a depressed zombie with negative energy that no one would want to be around."
depression,Ignored,"I’m tired of being ignored. Everyone I try to reach out it is the same, if it’s a girl they will talk to me for some time and then air me for eternity, if it’s a dude then it’s just the same passive aggressive replies. Lockdown hasn’t even affected me one bit I’m so tired of this shot"
depression,I’m tired to pretend strong for others,"Hey there. 

I just wanted to share a bit...

I am scared to live sometimes, I wake up in the mornings and can spend whole day in bed without water or food- because I feel I don’t exist. And during this quarantine I am able to do it. (Doing it right now) 

I believe I am a strong person, but I’m tired of pretending. I’m tired of being dictated by society how to feel about certain things, events or even yourself. I get hurt really easy and it devastates me. I’m feeling bad all the time for whatever I do and even say. And then it explodes in my head as dark thoughts like 

- does your life really matter ? (And I honestly respond and I feel it matters) 
- but why this matter should matter for me? Because it’s usually about others.

I sometimes have all these in my dreams and wake up in tears and whole day is ruined. Or days.

I just want to end this pain all the time ! But I don’t do it - too many things to care of for others if I kill myself. I live abroad alone and family is far.... I am independent so I live for fun basically. Plus I’m single and I feel it’s like a curse that I will never be able to find smb. 

Also I’m hard working person, I believe I am pretty successful in what I am doing. But I’m loosing interest in everything. I just want to destroy myself. - why work? Why fight? Why do I want to feel good? 

But I really want to. I stopped saying that to others because all I get is “you just need a good vacation”. 

I’m strong and will stay strong. But I’m giving up again. And it’s happening for all my life, since childhood. When giving up times come. Why it just can’t go out of my head. 

Thanks and sorry for wasting your time. If you know any good online support group for motivation maybe... let me know !"
depression,Am i weird for doing this?," whenever something upsets me and my ""i want to cut until i see blood"" episode (it can last 3 minutes to 2 hours) is over i just feel like an idiot.. i look at my arms and i just think if it was worth it.. then comes the guilt.. and then out of nowhere i think about it and laugh and even make a meme.. I don't know why.. i do this.. some people stoped talking to me because i would make those dark jokes all the time.. it's the way i cope with it. And I'm afraid that I'll lose more people in the summer because i always feel down during this season"
depression,My emotional struggle,"I've decided to tell whoever reads this that my new years resolution is to be a better person. But because of recent events, I've been extremely depressed. I've started remembering things in my life and it makes me zone out and start tearing up. I want to cry all day everyday but I feel that I should hold that in so I can make others happy, leaving no time for myself. I know not many people will read this but I just want this out there. P.S. please don't give me a crap tonne of support if you see this, there are others who need it more than me."
depression,I think guys get no attention,"I'm in no position to help anyone cause I feel miserable all the time but generally people flock to me to listen and give me shitty advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whereas I think men don't have that option cause even though I thought they were treated equal, they always say that no one cares to even listen which at first I thought they were just delusional but it may be that I was the delusional one."
depression,Pride month,Being bisexual with homophobic friends &amp; sister is depressing. I can't tell them when I like someone with the same sex.
depression,Trying for nothing,"Constantly trying to survive. I'm so tired. 

I'm always trying to make some type of money to be able to feed myself. I live in a house full of toxic and selfish people that I have to call family. The house is always a constant mess that I feel like I can never get out of here. 

I work so hard to barley make a living. I have to share a car with someone and our schedules always conflicts and I always feel bad for even taking the car. Theres always seems to be a problem after another and I'm so tired of living in the helpless and disgusting environment and pretend that I'm okay because I'm not. 


I'm tired of trying to always make things work out of the situation when I know it could be better. 

I don't wanna to do this anymore. I'm so tired of ""I should be lucky because I have a roof over my head"" but I live with people that only care about me because I'm blood and if it wasnt for that, they wouldn't otherwise. Then I have to deal with a disgusting environment where I can only cook in my room and clean dishes in a bathroom sink. 

Im so so tired 

I feel like I could just disappear and no one would care. I keep fighting but every single time it gets worse and I'm so tired

I'm tired of tolerating and reasoning 

I want to move out so bad I'm so so tired"
depression,i have been bullied because,because i am fucking sad and depressed. truth.
depression,This is my last resort —,"For the past five months I’ve had nobody to talk to but the four walls of my bedroom. Total isolation. My family does not interact with me, and my friends no longer contact me. I disappeared from social media because of a depressive episode (I’m Bipolar) and since then, nobody has reached out to me. I did not expect anybody to. 

Because of quarantine, I’ve had no way to talk to my psychologist and psychiatrist for 5 months. 

The voices in my head keep telling me to kill myself and it’s driving me crazy. I am in so much pain. Please I just want this to be over with. 

Sorry if this is such a mess, I haven’t spoken in so long. And english is not my first language."
depression,How can people be so motivated and happy,I have i blank look on my face most of the time I try to put on face that looks like I'm happy and fine. But alot of nights I cry silently so no one hears me. With this online school does not help because I'm really behind not because it's hard it's just I don't feel like doing anything I don't even want to move or talk. I've imagined alot of ways I would die most of them are suicide. I try to look for ways to get motivated but nothing works. And when I see people say stuff like don't kill yourself you have so much to live for I feal nothing it kinda makes it worse. I don't know what to do. I hate waking up so when I hear something that kinda sounds like my alarm clock is freak out a little it's like a jump scare. I have been motivated before but when I really start being productive it fades away.and I've already looked at the r/getmotivated. if you have any ideas to help please say something. And this is my first time posting
depression,Just a vent I guess,"I have just realized that people don't care as much as they say they do, I always have to be the one to reach out to my friends to talk, they never reach out to me. My biological dad took every opportunity to skip out on important parts of my life, such as elementary school graduation, visits when I went in foster care, not quitting drinking when I begged him to. (His alcoholic rage fucked me up.) He even blamed some shit on me while he was in prison, so blast him to hell, still don't talk to him. 

My bake shop teacher was an asshole, made me feel uncomfortable in class, and made me rethink my dream job, everything was fine until the quarentine hit, was gonna move to hot foods, start dating, but nope, fuck you OP. Fuck you indeed OP. 

My adoptive dad always expresses some sort of minor disappointment when I play video games, the thing I wanted to do, versus reading, the thing my dad asks me to do because it is good for me. So what? I don't give two shits, I take people's orders all day at a McDonalds in quarentine, and unload a whole truck by myself cause some women at my joint don't believe in equal responsibility. I then have to close the store, cause I am too nice, and now I said yes to something that I probably should've said no to.

I don't expect any of you to care, this might not even get recognized, you probably are laughing at my problems, and that is fine. I will only just become more insecure as a result, thanks for reading Reddit, hope you fucking neckbeards enjoy this one."
depression,"i dont know if o have depression, but if i do, would that mean that no one can love me?","everyone keeps telling me that i have to love myself and learn to be happy by myself and all but...i dont know, i cant, and even if i tried i just...cant

after all this quarantine shit i'll try to go and get myself diagnosed to see if i have something cause im tired

but if i do then would that mean that no one can love me? cause, everyone wants happy people, independent people, people with their life together...i dont have any of that, im not even attractive, im not even skinny...i dont really have anything

but i feel so alone...and well, i've always wanted someone to love...but if i cant be happy then can anyone even love me?

i just want to be loved too..."
depression,Seeing her kills me.,"Since school has been canceled due to recent events, it's been much easier to forget about my ex. But I see pictures on social media and it pains me more than I can describe. My heart physically hurts, I feel hopeless. Although it was a decently long relationship, it's still been over six months and I can't see myself happy with another person.

 I just feel numb, I feel hopeless in humanity as a whole. Everyone simply cares for themselves, when all I wanted to do was give her everything despite what it would do to me."
depression,:(,"Love when I go to sleep in an attempt to stop thinking just for my brain to say ""fuck you"" and dream about the shit I don't want to think about."
depression,cant connect with anyone,"i have been suffering for the past 7 years. Going through multiple episodes and pulling myself back up again. but my childhood trauma and issues always seem to follow me around no matter how hard i try to move on and embrace that and grow from it. it doesn’t seem to work. my mind always wanders back to the lack of emotional support i had as a child and the people who betrayed me. I cant trust anyone anymore and most importantly, i cant seem to make close friends. it feels like i cant connect with anyone at all if i try to talk and find similar interests. i cannot get close to anyone. i constantly think everyone will hurt me and i shut myself out. I have been trying to talk more, smile more and be interested in other people. i feel this need to get close to them but at the same time, i am always so formal and i cant interact with them the way people my age do (i am 20 years old). 
another things that constantly bothers me is wasting away my childhood and teen years because of depression. i missed out on so much and it pains me that i am still in that cycle and everyday i live with this, is just another day I wasting away. i hate waiting for the end. i want to be happy and i want to be successful. i want to see the world but all these dreams seem hard to reach not because of the hard work but sometimes the circumstances seem to just not be in my favor. 
I hate telling people my problems and my feelings. they get uncomfortable and say the wrong things when i tell them about my suicidal thoughts. i feel like a burden to them so i hate bothering people about it. I am writing all these here on reddit cause its comforting to know that someone is reading this and hearing me."
depression,I’ve been depressed for years due to bullying. How do I overcome this? M(19),"When I started Highschool, I would never have imaged I’d come out of it depressed as shit and barely passing my classes. I remember it starting just before the 9th grade my friends would start to tease me. I didn’t care back then, it was stupid little jokes that really didn’t bother me. It wasn’t until midway through grade 9 that it got progressively worse. Everywhere I went, I was a source of ridicule and always the butt end of a joke from my group of friends. Still, it didn’t bother me much until the jokes would revolve my background and heritage. One instance I vividly remember I opened my locker to find pictures of my cousin, who had past away when he was 12. Then my friends surrounded me and made choking noises. Then everyone knew about it. Everyday I would hear jokes about my cousin and it pains me still to this day that they would ever make fun of a child who passed well before their time. I get that I might not be the most extroverted person out there, and I’m definitely a bit of a pushover. I just don’t like conflict and every time I stood up for myself they would just knock me down even harder. I’m still friends with some of the ex perpetrators, it’s way better now that some individuals are out of the picture and everything has pretty much stopped. But I can’t help but notice how much this has affected the way i view myself. I’ve been smoking weed a lot recently due to just not wanting to feel empty anymore but it’s honestly making it worse. I just want to be happy, I’m not expecting you guys to have all the answers, mostly just wanted to vent somewhere."
depression,We don’t deserve this,Don’t you guys notice that depression happens to some of the most good and kind people?
depression,Life,"For a long time I wasn't sure if my sadness is depression. Even if the symptoms were present, I didn't admit it. I felt I needed a third party, specifically a therapist, to diagnose me.

Writing this post is me admitting that I have depression without a third party.

This doesn't mean I am fixing myself and working towards healing. Not really. I don't know.

I'm just tired of life. I want someone to end my life or magically fix me entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I like being and doing things alone since I don't have a significant other. (I rather spend time and be with my special someone.) But I have realized I am starting to get lonely and admit that I am lonely. I yearn for this special someone. I want to talk to them and be intimate with them."
depression,This is the only reddit group I get notifications for. THE ONLY ONE!,Reddit is making me depressed.
depression,I’m probably going to break up with my boyfriend soon. I wish I could have more self confidence but the world seems to think I don’t deserve it. I can’t stand it anymore.,"Im F19.
My ex was a cheating scumbag. He always compared me to other women he messed with and I was too afraid to leave because he always threatened suicide. 

My now boyfriend has a thing for blondes (I’m brunette/black hair). He’s asked me multiple times if I could wear a blonde wig and he told me a few weeks ago he had a dream about a blonde girl sucking him off. I’m probably going to break it off tomorrow, because I can’t keep going in this relationship when I know he has feelings like this. 

My confidence is dogshit already. I have absolutely no self worth and generally am just very nasty to myself. I’ve been abandoned by all my family, I have no friends to turn to, and all I want to do is end it. The irrational thoughts and depressive episodes have gotten so bad with jealousy that anytime I see a moderately attractive girl I want to cry and breakdown. 

I will never be as pretty or be as worth as them. Why do they always have to have the nice lives and friends? I buy thousands of dollars worth of clothes and products to make myself look better and NOTHING works, but they just smile and wave and get tons of friends. The only reason I had two boyfriends in the first place is because I knew them beforehand when we were kids, but if I broke up with my boyfriend I highly doubt any guy who values his social standing would even look at me, let alone ask me out or anything. Even though I’m 19, I don’t want to “let loose” and party and do all that shit. I just want a quiet normal life but I feel when everyone is done with that phase in their life, it’ll be in our late 20’s and by then it’s hard to start a family or whatnot, considering it takes years to get to know someone enough to want to marry them. 

Im going to fucking die alone, I swear to god. This always fucking happens. Something good happens and it turns out to be too good to be true."
depression,im hurting so bad,"idk what to do anymore. it feels like nobody cares about me anymore. i can’t stop crying, i cry all fucking day and i hate it. sometimes i don’t even realize right away that i’m crying. i don’t know how to get better anymore. everything is so meaningless now, nobody wants me anymore. i tried so hard to be good and a good friend and a good person and i’d like to believe i was. i don’t want to die yet, even though i can’t stop thinking about killing myself, i just want to sleep forever or at least a very long time. but right now i have a tiny cat calico critter and i’ve named him Truffle, and he makes me feel better because i feel like he doesn’t feel burdened by me telling him about my problems. i can’t do anything right anymore, everything i create it hideous, everything i say is ugly, everything i do is wrong. i’m trying very hard to still seem happy, but i can’t do that right either. my heart aches very bad, my whole body does. i haven’t felt this sad in a year. i hope this passes soon."
depression,I’m (23F) embarrassed and ashamed to share my feelings with my partner (27M) because I don’t want him to feel like I play victim.,"For starters, I apologize for the rambling and unorganized aspect of this post but I’m just in the thick of it. There’s no way for me to genuinely paint the whole picture with all the details, but I did my best. I read a lot on this sub to try to find clarity for myself and I’m hoping to be able to lean on this community—craziness and all. If anything it was a good opportunity to vent. 

I’ve been feeling ashamed of my depression and I’m having a hard time sharing my emotions with my partner of just over a year. For about two years, I’ve been professionally diagnosed and treated by a psychologist for major depressive and anxiety disorder. That being said, now that I understand my mental illness, it’s something I’ve battled for years prior. 

This means I have frequent highs and lows, overall lack of motivation, extreme fatigue, I cry a lot, and an ever-changing sex drive. All of which cause a great deal of friction in my relationship (especially the sex thing). 

I have always been the type to be transparent about my feelings to help the people around me understand what I’m going through. Lately, however, I’ve been feeling like my openness about my low emotions has been causing more damage. 

It’s happened before, but this week in particular, I’ve felt like my partner has been dedicating a lot of time to his routine. He still is working full time from home while I’m on minimal work-from-home (video meetings and online training for about 6-8 hours a week). I have tried to create a routine for myself and even cut out cannabis in an attempt to stay productive and motivated during the stay-at-home order. Unfortunately, the highs and lows of my depression seem to be more intense. I can’t keep myself busy and I’m constantly comparing my productivity to that of my partner. 

Ultimately, I think I get super insecure because he seems to be so on top of his responsibilities and self-motivated. As a result, I will get sad and cry about not feeling like we are living our lives together or spending enough time together. If I really analyze our interactions, we do make time to have meals together, he brings me coffee in the mornings, we are very open and verbal about our affection for one another. 

I start to get in the headspace of feeling like my emotions aren’t justified and I’m just being insecure. Why should I feel this way if I can think of all the good things from our relationship? I just haven’t been taking criticism well and have been feeling extra needy. It seems like my partner is having a hard time continuing to comfort me. 

Specifically, today (and the last couple days, but today was by far the worst) I had been feeling light headed and faint all day—like abnormally exhausted. I got through my day of meetings and side projects, made all of our meals, ran errands... by the end of the day I was just totally wiped. My arms and legs were starting to feel tingly and I just had to go to sleep. Obviously this whole day I’ve been expressing how I’m not feeling right and my partner would ask what he could do to help. 

After my most recent breakdown about not feeling like we get quality time together, he even took a day off from his side project to spend the evening with me. I was so grateful, but I just felt so sick and fell asleep. When I woke up I was still feeling bad and he reluctantly came into the room and asked what’s wrong and then made a comment (jokingly from his perspective) that there’s always some ailment with me and I’m his broken girl. I was immediately filled with undeniable guilt. The last thing I want is to be broken or be the girl who always has some issue and needs saving. 

I just don’t know what to do because my feelings are real and I know I have a mental illness—I want to be able to be open and recognize my feelings with my partner, but I also worry it’s causing more issues."
depression,Cutting a friend out who is nothing but supportive,"My best friend of six years has been nothing but supportive and encouraging with my struggles yet I still cut him out of my life. He's the only one who has ever known how truly bad it can get and has been there for me, yet I hate that he wants me to be happy and successful. I don't know if it's that because he's the only person to know this much, if it's because I'm more comfortable hating myself than being positive, if it's jealousy and spite and trust issues, or probably all of the above and then some.

All I know is that when I'm with him I don't hate him, but as soon as I'm away and alone I suddenly despise him. Like my mind completely warps who he is into someone I detest. I'm afraid that if I try to reconnect he'll either refuse for his own health, or that I'll inevitably cut him out again like an asshole, and this makes me afraid that I'll treat everybody who gets close like this. I can be remorseful and positive now, but when I begin slipping again any logic will go out the window and I'll revert to anger and isolation."
depression,Anyone else accepted the way things are?,[removed]
depression,I've never been so tempted by suicide...,"I went to my kitchen looking for ibuprofen cuz I have a headache and saw some painkillers. My first thought was just what the title hints at. ""What if I killed myself with these?"" And I closed the cabinet. I never thought that would be how I'd kill myself until 10 minutes ago. When its staring me in the face almost screaming ""over dose on me!"" its so hard not too. But I thought about the few real reasons I have to fight. In a way I feel like I've matured talking to my girlfriend when she's depressed. I've started thinking about the reasons for me to fight. And it helps so fucking much. I realized I do have reasons for myself and not just to make other people happy. In a way I started thinking about myself a bit more. Id recommend it."
depression,Depressing thought,"No one would be perfectly correct in either side of the coin. Laws are there for a reason. If the law states this or the procedure states this and that then do what is due. Problem is laws can be repealed. Why pass through time arguing over Laws that can change, can be repealed, made by a group of a few, supposedly to be followed by all. Justice in this world is impossible - we can't agree on anything as a Human Race. Empires fall and along with it laws change, to favor its present slaves, to dull the pain. This justice served differently across different epochs, same thing - people felt justified, some not. Laws would favor you today, come a different time it won't. Laws change, feelings of justice change, people die anyway, worse is that the version of justice when they lived didn't favor their cause. Imaginary almost, we make vivid dreams of perfection and order and it will stay that way, a dream while being awake. Humanity's Justice is based on Luck and Chance - Real Justice is straightforward and true and that is when death comes, we all face the same fate. When we are all silent of how we killed ourselves slowly instead of actually living. Maybe it is the dead who mourns for the living. A depressing thought it is."
depression,How am i supposed to keep going if i can't get help and can't get any better?,"My exams are coming up, i feel like i'm not prepared at all, my mental health is fucked, my physical one is also not great, and i can't get help because of how boomers my parents are, also i can't improve myself because for example i cannot change my environment, i'm trapped into having to study when i wish i could give attention to more parts of my life. i'm writing this in the middle of a online class because i cant go on like this. i cant man.

This is like the 100th post i write desperately here on reddit and nothing has changed, why even try anymore (dont think that i didnt try in real life)

i dont like this world at all i prefer sleeping"

depression,I feel too far gone for anyone to care. Depression has made me horribly boring.,"I don't really seek out help because I feel bad for oversharing, so I'm not trying to blame people for not noticing or anything, but I just feel like I'm not worth the effort of trying to help. 

I've been depressed for so long that instead of ""nothing that used to be important seems fun anymore"", which is a warning sign, has turned into ""no interests, hobbies, or discernible personality"". I've become boring because depression has spent years hollowing me out from the inside. Why would anyone want to help someone who doesn't have anything to offer to the world by recovering. 

I'm not crying out for help or fighting to get better, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I just hate how I'm not a person anymore. How I'm scared to talk to new people, not because I'm horribly socially awkward or anything, but because I know I have nothing to offer. It takes one simple question about what I do for fun or what I like for me to inevitably draw a blank and for someone to immediately lose interest. I just want things to be fun again. Even the stuff I enjoy never seems worth the effort. I'm sleeping 12 hours a day just to pass the time and hopefully fast forward until things get better, but I know they won't. I'm not suicidal but I feel like I'm complicit in wasting my life, which might as well be the same thing to me. 

I feel so detached from basic human interaction. Friendships and a life outside of the bare minimum is so distant to me it feels like something that only happens in movies at this point. I even feel bad typing this all out because I feel dramatic, but I just wish I was worth someone's time or effort. I wish I could be someone's friend, and someone could enjoy being mine. I want something to offer. I'm exhausted."
depression,Ever feel like you’re just an old shell of the person you used to be?,"Stuck between hanging on to my old self and just accepting I’m not that anymore I don’t even recognize myself anymore.  I’m stuck between fighting another day and just giving up. I feel so alone but don’t like being around anyone. I have no desire to make an effort in seeing anyone or contacting friends/ family. I’m just existing these days hoping one day a switch will flip. Everyday this dark hole I’m in gets a little deeper. And I hate talking about my problems cause I feel misunderstood or written off , for some reason I want my problems to really resonate with anyone I explain them to (maybe so I don’t feel all alone?) idk if I’ll ever genuinely feel happy again. Sorry I just needed to rant 😞"
depression,I felt peace with being dead for a brief moment,"I wanna preface this with saying that at the same time I feel scared of death and a little scared of living. Tonight I cut myself and I went through the same shit by listening to sad music, overthinking, and wallowing in my misery. But once I threw myself onto my bed, stared at the ceiling and spaced out, I felt ok with being completely dead for a moment. Idk how to describe because it was really weird but I’ll do my best if you understand. But I was laying on my bed staring at the ceiling and everybody dies in their nightmares started playing. Once the song came on I started shivering a lot while listening to it, completely motionless, and once it stopped, I stopped shivering, spaced out, and just felt lifeless for a little bit with a sharp pain in my heart, wishing that it could end tonight, and it felt kinda good for a bit. That’s the best I could describe my experience tonight and maybe someone else has felt something similar?"
depression,I have felt lost for five years with no goals and no dreams...,"I have felt lost for five years, no matter how happy or sad I am...

For the past five years I’ve battled with depression. Early on I felt it the worst, I had thoughts of suicide and I separated myself from everyone who I loved and cared about. Over the years, I began to slowly understand my depression, but still succumb to it. I would have happy days/weeks/months, but at the end of the day I would still be alone with my thoughts at night, and it would all come back to me.

I finally saw a therapist, but it didn’t help very much, even though I really tried to give it my best effort. I believe one day I will try therapy again, but I don’t feel like trying again so soon after it didn’t work out. 

Recently, even with corona going on, I’ve been in a limbo, and after reading through some posts, I can tell I’m not alone. As people are stuck inside with their own thoughts, it can be hard, even though your daily stresses aren’t as high.

My problem is that I have been trying to control my thoughts and work on my mental health during this time, but I feel lost in my life. I am on a career path that was chosen for me by my parents. They paid for me to go to college and get a great degree at a respected university, but I don’t feel like I’m on the right path. I enjoy what I’m studying in school, but I don’t think it’s what I want to do for the rest of my life, and at this point I typically hear two things, either “you only have one life, do what makes you happy” or “take a semester/year off and decide what you want to do” and both of these don’t work for me.

I don’t know what makes me happy. I’ve spent every night for the past five years trying to focus on the things that make me happy and often times it just comes down to the people closest to me. I don’t seem to have any passions or goals or even really hobbies. Thus, I don’t really have any careers that excite me, unlike some of my friends who have had dreams of jobs they’ve wanted to do since they were a kid.

I guess I ask you, if you are still reading, what would you do if you were me? If you had no goals or dreams in life, but you were on a path you didn’t necessarily want to be on? 

I can’t leave the path because that would require choosing another path, and I don’t know which path I would even pick. However I can’t stay on the path I’m on because that’s a life wasted.

Thank you if you read this far, this is my first time posting about my mental health publicly on the internet."
depression,We exist to suppress our own existence,"Why do we exist? We exist to hate each present existence. We can't get what we want because if we do, we are bad. We don't even get what we need. We were born to experience suffering or at least to suffer for others. We are alive to slowly kill ourselves with living, kill ourselves with the desire to keep on living even if we always get shit, get used, get discriminated, bullied and spat upon by those people who have more desire than us to keep on living only for all of us to meet the same fate - dust."

Every once in a while I’ll find something but it quickly goes away. I don’t know how to open up to people in my life. I feel if I talk to people about these things they’ll be weirded out. I can’t bring myself to do anything anymore besides stay in my room all day. I can’t see a future where I become even a tiny bit successful. I wish I didn’t exist, to say the least."

depression,I don't know what to do.,"Hello, for a little context I'm a college student and I just finished my second semester from home. My home life could've been much worse, but it broke me down over time. Split households with a bipolar mother who regularly gave up on me and my sister when all we needed was a little support, what were essentially multiple divorces, a disabled veteran father who couldnt understand the line between helping and degrading, and a grandmother who forced her way into our lives and has tried to put my dad on the streets for years. It's been really tough, but I naturally struggled with anxiety and depression, and they just got compounded by the situation.

On top of that, I am really bad at connecting with people in meaningful ways. I've had very few good friends and I cant manage to keep any because my low confidence makes it really hard to be the one to reach out. College helped me turn some of this around. It gave me some time away from home to try to address some of the pain and heal, and make meaningful friendships. College was the first chance I've had to heal in nearly 7 years.

And then Covid struck. I had to move back home. I've had to say goodbye to some of the only positive friendships I had and move directly back in to a large source of trauma growing up. Its killing me.

I'm here because I dont know what to do. I can no longer even picture a future for myself. I'm really only here for the remainder of summer, and next semester is in 2 and a half months, but its beyond my reasoning. I'm stuck mentally, I feel worthless, I'm alone aside from the family that never treated me well to begin with, and I'm losing it a little.

Anybody have any words of wisdom they'd like to share? I know that was kind of an info dump but I'm really going through it right now and I'd appreciate any help anyone can offer."
depression,How I cope with my life playing games or being on PC,"20 M here and I never thought I would be typing this but I've regretted the decisions I've made in my life. I am here sitting at home all day playing video games for the last 2 years of my life. I don't know what happened to me, i was always a bright kid but as I got older, i lost interest in things and had no drive to move forward.

this led to me dropping out of college and spending my whole 2 years gaming, hooking up with girls on tinder or sulking everyday. I never thought i would be this way but it has come to this point. I never had a core group of friends which I was a part of and seeing my school buddies move on with their lives just makes me feel more bad about myself. Its just I just stopped being myself but I cant go and see a therapist since I am from India and there is a stigma associated with mental health.

I hate seeing my friends going to prestigious colleges which I could've been a part of, hate seeing them going to parties leaving me behind in the dust; like i've been forgotten. Even my childhood friends who I grew up playing with meet behind my back and go on treks etc which really hurts me because they come to my every birthday to wish me like they are doing me a favour. which makes me more angry is that I've been nice to everyone growing up and all I got is just bullshit from everyone. Even I thought my GF loved me but she turned out to be a 2 faced bitch aswell like the others. I have a shit ton of anger issues and mabye depression but i cant say for sure since i have not being diagnosed. I was gonna take admission in college this year but i am worried due to the virus everything is closed.

I became jealous of everything my friends have achieved but I cant seem to shake this feeling of drowning I have. I spend my days just sitting in front of the computer playing games, working out or watching movies, i hate being the person i have become.

I wish i was like everybody else, have a life, friends, college etc. 

the most amusing thing is that my parents  have almost the same problem as me, my mom regrets not working and feels like a loser, dad barely goes out and lost his company. I dont know if it is a genetic thing but i hate living like this."

depression,"Started opening up to my bf and a close friend about being depressed. They ask how they can help me, but I don't even know how they can.","Quarantine has hit me hard. I have not had a really bad despressive episode in a long time, alongside my GAD. I even began self harming again. I finally decided to open up about it to my bf and a close friend, and they both have asked how they can help, but I don't even know how they can help right now. I don't want them to feel like crap because I can't think of anything they can do to help me, but I also don't know what to tell them. I need things to go back to normal for me to start feeling better, or at least that's what I think might make me feel better. What do you tell people when they ask how they can help?"
depression,Feeling sorry for myself for once,"I never feel sorry for myself. I'm always trying to keep everyone around me happy but for once I just can't anymore. I know people go through way worse but I'm reaching my limit. I've had a bad week. Like a really bad week. The thoughts of suicide are constant. Ending this pain. I go into school for part of the week as I'm not trusted alone and it is a good distraction. I saw one of my favourite teachers who was the only person I'd ever go to if I had problems, we had nice fun chats and I'd chill in her room. She was like a friend as I'd locked everyone else out. And we made eye contact yesterday and she completely blanked me, I even smiled in a ""hello"" way. It wouldn't normally bother me so much but that just hurt. I know she's not my friend but she really helped me out so it feels like I've lost another friend. And I don't even know what I did wrong. Since Wednesday my chest hurts whenever I take a deep breath I have to breath shallow and when I lie down on my right side it hurts, like a sharp stabbing pain on the left side of my heart. I'm Suicidal anyway so if it's anything bad then I guess God wants me gone too so I've not told anyone about that. Life is such a bitch. No matter how happy I'll ever be, I'll always have regrets. It's too much, everything is too much and for once in my fucking life I'm feeling sorry for myself. And I can't even talk to my therapist until next week and the other therapy agency who's supposed to check up on me didn't even check up. They are probably just really busy anyway or they just forgot but that's okay. I cant deal with the quarantine climate either. I've felt this way for too long. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is the lack of lethal tools as my mum took them all away. That doesn't make me feel safe, it makes me feel trapped. Everything is telling me to just end this pain. To find peace. I think I'm going to find a way soon. To make it all stop."
depression,"I am stupid, dumb, ignorant, retarded and don't deserve to be alive.","I am 39 with learning issues and minor brain damage and I have a hell of a record of mental illness ranging from dyslexia to cptsd, severe chronic depression, severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia, ocd, add, The list goes on and all of these are confirmed by my psychiatrist which took years. 

I have a black spot under my tooth inside the bone thats an infection and I was on meds the crown on the tooth is broke and needs a new crown but I can't afford the 1300 its going to cost to fix and there is no dental colleges around me. 

I live on disability and the stimulus check thing I used to put towards getting myself out of debt, paying bills I needed to pay that I was months behind on. so I have no money.

I have nothing but 4 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, old run down shoes that are falling apart. a cheap laptop that can barely handle video games.

I am sitting here thinking of everyone who has come and gone in my life, my mom, dad, grandma, who are dead. my old friend I had who didn't want anything to do with me anymore back in 2012 she cut me out of her life. 

Had another friend who I used to play world of warcraft with who I lost contact with in 2009 and I sit here thinking about her nonstop and how I miss the times we had. Then there was another world of warcraft friend I had who I miss deeply who introduced me to sick puppies one night when we were talking about songs. And as I type this I am listening to the song she introduced me to and crying hysterically how I miss her.

I have no other friends, no family. I am utterly alone in this world and I am not that smart for example I tried getting back into WoW a few months ago and I can't understand half the stuff in the game or what to do. I struggle with reading and writing. I am using google voice to text to type this.

I am so tired of being like this and so tired of every time I let someone in my life they up and abandon me and leave me. It is so hard for me to let people go and to forget about them. I think about them years later and miss them, the more days that go by the more years that go by the harder it gets that I miss them more. 

I wish I had my mom and dad and grandma back, wish I had my friends back and wish I had a way to get this tooth fixed before my jaw rots off from infection and can get the tooth fixed so I can chew since I lost most my teeth on my right side on the bottom. I get this tooth pulled I won't have anything in the side or back to chew on. 

I am so tired of this life and struggling like this. No one will hire me because of my mental issues and people up and leave after talking to me for awhile. I am so tired of life. it shouldn't be this hard and this difficult. I feel like death would be better than this at least I wouldn't be struggling anymore to survive and wouldn't be missing anyone."
depression,Back at it again,[removed]
depression,Why don’t friends and family love me anymore? I feel so alone all the time.,"Firstly, I hope this is the right subreddit to post to. I initially thought about posting elsewhere (/r/relationship\_advice, amongst others), but I think it ultimately stems from my depression. Here goes!  

Forewarning: I’ve spent the better half of 2 hours trying to put what I feel into words here, and what I’ve written below is the best I can come up with, but it still doesn’t describe how hurt and unloved and lonely I feel. Also, trigger warning for mentions of suicide and suicidal thoughts. 

I live, but I feel like I am dying inside. I’m a 26-year-old male. I \*think\* I’m attractive (although a little overweight). I have a good job, friends, and family that I love, hobbies I enjoy, and goals that I have (and aim) to achieve. I love myself (but not in an egotistical way, I think), exercise most days of the week and eat relatively healthily, but despite all of this, I feel empty and alone all of the time. 

In regards to my social life, I have to be the one to reach out to friends and family and organise things otherwise they don’t (ever), despite their promises to do so. I love my friends and family immensely, and I have said this to them, but they don’t reciprocate, ever. When we do hang out, albeit rarely nowadays, they don’t ask about my life or invite me to anything, which makes me feel they don’t want to know me anymore. They don’t reciprocate the effort I put into being a fucking fantastic friend. For example, I \*flew\* to the other side of the fucking country to see my best friend for his birthday in October last year (we hadn’t seen each other face-to-face for over two years, despite our regular catchups online). My birthday is a few months after his. How did he reciprocate? He forgot my birthday. I was his first friend when he moved to the city and university nine years ago. Nine fucking years, and he still doesn’t know when my birthday is. Cunt.

Despite all of this, I try to stay positive and involved in their life because I love them. They know I love them, but I haven’t heard them reciprocate it, which makes me feel fucking awful about myself, as if something is so wrong with me it makes people not love me. I know I’m a decent person, and I try to be a positive influence (most of the time). I ask about, discuss and remember important things that are going on in their life, joke around with them, share passions and goals I’ve achieved with them, and be a good friend/brother/son/relative when we hang out. I know I’m a smart person who likes to have long discussions about the things that matter. I offer to be there when I think they’re having a bad time, but when I have gone to them for help, I feel they put me at arm’s length to stop them from catching whatever it is that gave me depression. 

Friends and family don’t reciprocate my love for them, and it’s killing me. I don't know if my friends or family love me anymore. I haven’t heard anyone I love return “I love you” to my face (or even in a text or missed call) to me in a very, very long time, which makes me feel unbearably unloved and alone. It’s like everyone doesn’t care about me anymore, which makes the fight against my depression and the suicidal thoughts impossibly hard alone. I’ve been on medication and seeing psychologists since I was 20, and these two things are the only things that are keeping me alive right now. Before COVID, I was playing social sports with a few insular groups, but none of these activities makes me feel loved. I don’t have a girlfriend, and most dates I’ve had in my life don’t get past the introductory phase. I just feel so god damn alone, and I’m losing reasons to live. Me loving me isn’t enough, and I’m so fucking tired of being alone on team Me. 

How do I feel loved again, despite no one else loving me? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I havent felt love from another human being in a long time and it's going to kill me."
depression,Lost,Last year i lost a part of my self and i really want what ever i lost back? I miss the old me :(
depression,Asking for help makes me feel needy,"I know that i should not feel this way, but i don't like discussing anything mental health outside of my therapist. Especially when it may be crucial to help someone understand me better. If my teachers ever ask   why i did poorly on a test, or my parents asking about something. I would never tell them about whats going on and sort of plead the 5th. I don't like to appear weak/looking for pick me ups. Which I feel like would happen if I ever tell people about whats going on in my head. I'm trying to improve this through the anonymity of the internet. So reddit, how should i ask for help or patience  for me for those close to me, without appearing to needy. Any replies are appreciated, thanks."

depression,Empty,"I’m nothing more then a husk of the person I used to be. I don’t even remember the old me. But yet I’m not mad or scared, I just feel indifferent about my situation.

depression,Late night paranoia,"Disclaimer: I am having troubles putting my thoughts down in English so if it doesn't make any sense I am sorry. 
So last night I was having troubles falling asleep and so I started thinking about when it was that my depression started. But I couldn't really pin point it. However thinking about it I started to notice that a lot of it was ""external"". It's like the road to adulthood is constellated by attacks on your self-esteem. I started thinking about how normal character flaw I had through out my life and used to be considered quirks started to be judged in a heavier and heavier way. But not just by people around me, I think that's normal. What I mean is that in recent years I've been coming across a lot of articles, essays, videos that analyze how character flaws are a sign of mental hillness and you have to fix them to be normal.
Like in my teens it used to be that I was shy but now that's not a characteristic, it's a problem, it means something is wrong. 
In my teens I used to be very nice. Now it means that I am a pushover and something is wrong.
I've always been ok on my own and not going out much to party because it bored me, and when I was a teen that was considered ""responsible, mature or whatever"". Now it means that I am a recluse and I can't enjoy life so something must be wrong with me.
So what I am asking myself is how much of my depression is mine and how much of it was that a perfect standard has been set for how a person should behave and if you don't fit that you have to be made to feel horrible and the only way is to change everything about you to fit the standard?"
depression,The last and only time I tried to open up to my mom resulted in her trying to guilt the shit out of me,"A few months ago I expressed how I was feeling suicidal to my mom and she implied if I were to kill myself that she would do the same. She’s been forcing me to exercise cause she thinks that’ll fix all my problems but when I tell her I still feel terrible mentally, she keeps saying shit like “your technique is bad”. No advice she’s ever given to me has helped so now whenever she gives advice my mind immediately thinks she’s full of shit

Anyways sorry for ranting I just got no one to open up to. xo"

depression,Living in my secluded world,I shut myself out from the world.no friends. Or anyone close to me..i stay home avoiding people. I am unworthy and ugly and have non-confidence to put myself out there and do something for myself. The world feels intimidating and I'm shy and weird.

depression,"I feel worse and worse, while my family- the only anchor that keeps me alive- is dissappearing","Sorry for the incoherent thoughts, I am just venting a little bit.

I am in the last few months of my master degree. Soon, I'll be out there, getting a job and do the things I am supposed to. And I will inevitably get trampled on. I have no idea how an incompetent human being like me would survive out there. 

I've been feeling empty yet so heavy at the same time. I see no reason to go on. No purpose, no passion, not good at anything. Yet I have to get a job, settle down, take care of my family and take charge of multiple properties my parents are renting. All this overwhelming responsibilities, while I am just worried whether I will at least be able to get/hold a job or survive. 

Almost every time I think about death, my family is the only thing that keeps me going. I have no one to turn to, not even a friend. So they are what I considered a ""safe haven"", somewhere for me to return  to, where I feel supported. 

But their marriage is deeply unhappy and dysfunctional. As I try my best to help them deal with the problem, my mother went into a verbal fight with me and said many hurtful things. Although I have never told her about my depression, I know I would never be able to tell her (and my father). They have enough things occupying their minds, I can't add more to the problem.

And for the first time, I feel truly alone in the world. I have absolutely nobody to go to. For fuck sake, due to the pandemic I am currently in my home countries with my family right now so I couldn't even get professional help without them knowing. I am just merely existing and I am not sure how much longer can I go on."
depression,Do I have depression or is Corona just taking a toll on me?,"This isn't the first time I've felt like this but it is the worst.

To give some back story, I was homeschooled for most of my life. Meaning I had no friends or social life, hell half the time I had to take a vitamin D pill because I was never outside.

Throughout high school I had a really tough time. I was slut shamed a lot despite doing nothing. I've constantly felt like people just want to use me for my body, even when there are no signs of it. Despite all that, I still did good in school.

This year though... My first semester of college one of my professors was sexually harrassing me, stalking my social medias, trying to blackmail me. I reported him and got an incomplete for the class. I was hoping of turning things around this semester, but then corona happened.

I just feel no motivation to do anything. Even typing this up feels like I'm moving in slow motion. I just feel like I'm back in middle school, trapped away from everything. I've completely given up on all my classes. It's been about a month and a half since I've done any work for them, and I'm trying so hard to just get motivated but it feels like it takes everything just to get out of bed. I don't shower on a regular basis, It's lucky if I eat a single meal a day, I could sleep for 16 hours or stay up for well over 48 hours with no problem, I've been cutting people out of my life, fighting with my boyfriend almost everytime I talk to him.

I know that none of you can diagnose me, but to those who struggle with depression, is this what it's like? Was it a gradual build up till your breaking point? Should I contact someone for help?"
depression,I tried killing myself 8 days ago by hanging. I survived. Now I'll try Inert Gas Suicide,"I've been suffering from depression for past 7 years now. I had social anxiety from Idk (Hey you guys remember calling your mother MOM the first time. Me neither) yeah that long. 

So anyway it was just some bad and negative thoughts at first but after 2016 it became worst. Like hella bad. Life became hard and weird at the same time. It was like someone attached a heavy ass truck to me that no one could see. I lost all of my friends, gf, relationships, will to live, hobbies. I used to play guitar for 4 hrs a day 4 days a week. My college grade went from 4.8 GPA TO 1 something. And I didn't knew just what the f*ck was wrong with me.

Years passed and my thinking changed from, "" I'll live with it. I'm strong, to, fuck it I'll just end it cuz no matter how I try I can never beat this.""

So about a week ago I decided to kill myself by hanging but guess what at last moment the rope broke. Unfortunately I didn't get any brain damage and I'm well but wearing a turtleneck (u can see impression of ropes on my neck &amp; it fucking hurts)

You know how in movies when someone attempts suicide and it fails they be like, ""I'm born for a higher purpose, Maybe this is a signal bla bla bla."" Yeah it doesn't work like that. I'm even more depressed now, cuz I had one job to kill myself that too I couldn't do. 

I read about this Inert Gas Suicide on Internet and ordered a nitrogen cylinder, mask and tubes along with pressure regulator for a peaceful death in me sleep. But then Govt here banned dilvery of non-essential items bue to covid 19 (the only thing I don't have is pressure regulator, my lungs will explode if pressure is too high and I don't want a painful death) . So guess I'll have few more weeks. Thought I should post this here. 

I HAD a supportive friend circle, they helped me a lot, GF also helped. Everybody loved me and supported me when I confessed about my depression. After a year  they became tried and wanted me to be all right which I just can't. Because no matter how much anyone will help they can never out shout the voices in my head. 

I workout a lot. Eat healthy. Walk in nature. And I know no matter how hard I try nothing will get better."
depression,Got my online exam for university,"It’s techically two essays that they gave us 24 hours to do. It’s due in 3 hours and I haven’t done it. In fact, for this subject I skipped every single lecture this semester. I am overwhelmed and can’t get out of bed. Nobody supports me or even cares. I just feel like giving up and crying lol"
depression,I just really want to die full stop.,"For context I'm dying maybe 4 years at most left but it's taking a really long time I was done after spending a full 6 months of time in hospitals. I kept pushing after spending a full years worth of time in hospitals because of family. But around 4 or 5 months ago I said fuck it and fuck my family if they want to keep forcing me. I've been told I'm going to be thrown out if I don't continue with my treatments they fucking suck and don't help enough in terms of fixing me they just delay the progression. Every time I try to reason with them or get them to see my side they just guilt me into doing what they want or threaten me. I fucking loath living I cant kill myself because I'm broke and most methods take far to long and if I don't die but instead become even more crippled ohh god that's just going to make me try harder then I'll be forced into a mental hospital(not doing that shit again). I really hate living and dying this slowly just destroyed any love I've had for my mom and dad. When I got the news that I was going to die I was really happy but now that I have to live it out for this long(1year or so, so far) my depression came back or it could be because of my treatment."
depression,Some nights I sleep early just so I don’t have to feel so empty,
depression,I don’t know who i am anymore..,"I (24F) moved today Texas with my long term boyfriend a few years back. I’m originally from Michigan, born and raised. I lived in a small town and when i was 18 i got out of there as fast as i could go and went to Tennessee (to chase my dreams and gtfo). Met my boyfriend in college and wanted an even better life, so we moved to Texas. But, I’ve never been so physically and emotionally alone. 

When i lived in Michigan, i was always with friends or family. There were rarely times i wasn’t surrounded by friends; Joking, laughing, partying, just being young and free. I always knew who i was. Even when i moved to Tennessee, i made friends and felt very confident in myself. 

I’ve battled with anxiety and depression since i was 16 but I’ve never felt overwhelmed until now. I don’t have any friends or family here. I like living here, though. But ive come to realize i don’t even know who i am, or really remember what it was like to be myself. I don’t remember how to bust people’s balls, how to have fun, i don’t remember what it’s like not to be constantly worrying and stressed about the future. I don’t remember what it’s like to be myself. I don’t even know what that would look like... or feel like. i used to be so confident in myself. I was so funny and people used to compliment my personality. I feel like a shell. I don’t know who i am anymore... i don’t recognize myself. I am a stranger to myself. 

Sorry if this is more like a rant or doesn’t belong here. I just, i don’t know where else i can find like-minded people who might feel the same or have and pulled out of it."
depression,LOST,"I'm lost, really, really lost. Nothing has any flavour, nothing gives me any happiness on earth except things that end up destroying me. I always come back to suffering, I always come back to anger, disappointment and the desire to see the world fall with me, because that is all that has been given to me.

It is already written, this is the work I must do, to free my soul from this prison, and to bring with me those who share my pain.

We are in the kingdom of those who have fallen, all sons and daughters of the Demiurge, who can do nothing but imitate and lead to oblivion.

There is no reason to have hope once almost all hope has been crushed, and then there is only one thing left to do: Destroy what is left in us and destroy what is inside those to whom it has been given, to show them that we're all flawed."
depression,How can I make myself believe in myself?,"My whole life I've felt stupid and not good enough, I will try things then give up before there's a test or some kind of review. Like I did a business course I really enjoyed it, until it got to the tests, I did the first 3 then when it came to the final I just didn't go, the teacher called me and tried to get to go in I put it off until was too late. I ended up getting my other results and for most things had been top of the class. 

It's not just school, it's everything I won't put myself forward for roles I know I can do because I don't want be rejected (at my current job and they oddly don't ask you if you want to further yourself/role they think you should ask because you get hired for a certain area and they kinda think that's it, but I've been questioned by managers why I haven't put myself out there for training/other roles which I've found out they've never done with others) 

I'm sure everyone hates me when I guess there's not much proof to that. 

It seems like others  believe in me, but tbh I think it's a trap or a joke when I know it's most likely not and they actually believe it. So how can I believe in myself and not just put myself down and behind?"
depression,Just alone in the quarantine,"I just wanted to let it out. I have been on meds and if it wasn’t for that I would had probably killed myself already. But I haven’t so here I am trying to find a solution to everything and survive.
November, I started to have problems at work, I have worked there for 6 years and appreciated. But my performance and many mistakes cannot be ignored. However I feel lucky that I was given another chance, I know someone else would had been fired but I earned trust and at least this time it paid off. Then my 15 year old dog died in December. It was heartbreaking. He was my child, my companion and I would say even my best friend. He was sick and putting him down was soooo hard.
Then my husband left me. I think he was just waiting for my dog to die so he will not feel guilty if I had to call him to tell him about it. Or maybe because he knew it would destroy me to be alone for the holidays. (We moved to his country and I have my family far enough to afford to visit once every 3 years). And so in February after two months if trying our best not to fight and be better, he realized that he doesn’t want to change himself and his addiction problems. He wants to be free to do whatever he wants. 
Then March...my boss-mentor quit, she was my rock and the person that helped me the most in my career. I was feeling insecure about my work because the new person coming, how this will change the dynamics at work. Due to the lockdown we didn’t even have opportunity to say our goodbyes and to make sure everything was taken care of. We left that afternoon and where told not go go back to office. Me now alone with my cat. 
Since March I literally had little contact with anyone. I was so depressed in general that I was not even eating, I had some protein shakes and that was pretty much my food for like weeks. I went out of the house 3 times. To buy essentials. I have spoke with friends online but I was so embarrassed to even tell them that I was alone through all this. I am afraid. I cried, I have worries about my finances and my living situation. My husband is not willing to help with anything. So 60% of my salary is towards rent and the rest to food, gas, bills and literally nothing else. 
At least my student loan is paused. 
Then my resident status. It expired in between this madness. To renew it I need my husband to apply. I need to pay as well over 300€. If I don’t get it I need to leave the country in 3 months. I can’t even afford to imagine if I have to move 12 years of my life in two suitcases and my cat. 
I just can’t. Go back home broke and single at 39 with nothing on my name. 
What can I do? I am supposed to go back to work in June, but still having a good job cannot help me with the issues of insufficient money. 
I am to the point of thinking to prostitute myself because I am completely lost and nobody of my friends or family are going to be able to help me.  I speak Spanish and I offered classes online but nobody wants. I don’t know what else to offer,I started to sell stuff from my house but this is nothing.  What electrical 
I don’t know what to do, I am alone in another country and I feel overwhelmed. My rent is cheap compared to price’s now so I cannot move to cheaper. Why is this happening to me? My dad cannot even afford to pay my burial expenses if I kill myself here. He is old and I cannot even help him with money or viceversa Nobody cares, what to do? Sometimes I just want to dissolve and not be a problem for anyone else."
depression,Moving too fast/still sorta wanting death?,"I’ve had past experiences with depression, I wasn’t suicidal but at one point in my life I just started hoping I’d die within the next couple years or so. At this point I feel as if I’ve overcome depression. I’ve won. However I still feel as if dying wouldn’t be so bad. Like even though I’m fairly happy now, I still want to die in the next few years just to forget everything. 

I also feel as if I’m moving too fast, something bad will happen, I’ll crash and spiral back down to depression. I’m just moving to fast and steady for my own good. 

I honesty don’t know, it just feels like a gut feeling. I don’t want to die, but I do. I’m happy to be happy, but something is wrong. Anyone know why I feel this way?"
depression,I need help,"It’s pretty comforting to read some of the threads here on r/depression. It makes me feel less alone. I have a pretty extreme story. A lot of bad shit has happened and not a lot of good. I was reading a thread about people that have been battling their depression and haven’t been able to finish their online university obligations and started writing this as a reply to relate to their stories of having a hard time with their studies/mental health during this quarantine until I  realized I might of got carried away and I might not relate to their life’s much(idk). So here’s what I wrote. I haven’t even finished high school. I’m 27 years old. My dad and grandma paid to sign me up for a online high school diploma class 2 years ago. Ive been struggling with addiction my whole life and had to drop out at 18 years old because my life was unmanageable as fuck on drugs. I’ve been to many rehabs(over 20) and sober livings(a lot). I’ve been homeless, I’ve overdosed, I’ve wanted life to have mercy on me and take me out so I wouldn’t have to suffer. It started to seem like a sick joke to me from the amount of pain that I’ve been in. August 2019 Somehow I finally was able to get sober. IMy grandma let me move back into her house and I got 2 jobs as a server. It was helping having jobs, feeling somewhat productive and having a reason to get out of bed. I was still very depressed. I don’t have any friends anymore because of the lifestyle I have lived(using drugs in isolation, destroying family/friend relationships and shutting everyone out all for the sake of finding relief in a very messed up way). All of my experiences have beat me down to a shell of a shell. I don’t think I’m capable of much anymore. I feel damaged. After moving in I ended up relapsing a couple short times but bounced back somehow and kept both of my jobs. I’m looking for a solution and I know it’s not just one thing that will do it. Ive tried AA/NA SO MANY times and have had a lot of success with it, but after relapsing a lot, even most people in the meetings don’t really want much to do with me because I haven’t been able to get this thing(imagine not even being accepted by another junkie). I know I could try different meetings but at this point I’m pretty AA’D out and cant see myself doing another fucking fourth step. Ive tried a lot of different anti depressants and haven’t found one that has helped yet. I am currently trying to get help by an patient assistant foundation for a new ground breaking anti depressant that can work instantly but the back and forth between the foundation and myself has been harder than I feel like it should be for a depressed person to get help from a company that is supposed to help people get their depression medication. (Tangent, sorry) The quarantine has not helped at all and I’m falling apart more so . I did start seeing a therapist. Despite all of the reasons to better myself, I can’t find the motivation and can’t make the connection in my fucked up brain to get myself out of this shithole. I need help but really feel I can’t help myself. I feel stuck"
depression,A quote,"“When your not that invested in life, it is easy to accept the certainty of death”, read it on a microdosing thread, I think it helped but I’m not sure. Maybe I just need to re-invest, it’s just frustrating I guess. Hope it helps,"
depression,Am I choosing to be sad,"To put it simply, the last four years have felt really miserable. I have no self-esteem, and I don’t even enjoy doing nothing. I’ve also experienced some losses in the past year, and I don’t really see things getting any better. It’s getting kinda unbearable

But not once have I spoken to anyone about how I feel, like at all. And I have no plan to in the futute either, because I really have nothing to be sad about.

So why is my brain telling me every day that I am choosing to be sad for attention?? I guess I feel like I’m faking everything, but why would I even do that 

I dunno. I guess I’m wondering if anyone relates"
depression,Another day of suffering. It never ends.,"I hope I die painfully. I deserve it for being a piece of shit.

One day soon, I will have the courage to leap over the bridge I stand next to every day and finally end it all."
depression,I'm feeling so sick," But knowing how someone has hurt you and you tolerated that behavior, leaves a really bad wound. I can't stop thinking of this person and it make me nauseated and numb with other responsibilities at hand. I don't want want to but I emotionally shut down not knowing how to reply/connect with someone or how to be, it makes me feel so worthless and tired. Like I really want this world to end. I'm sorry, I'm just tired of pushing myself to live everyday. I'm getting more sick each day."
depression,...is it going to get better?,"I'm tired of of so many things. I'm tired of the job market looking the way it does (even before the virus, I was struggling to find a new job), I'm tired of not having my own place, I'm tired of not having the money to do the things I want to do. I'm so over this year. My family is so condescending. The worst part is, the economy won't fully recover anytime soon, so I don't even know what to do except sit here and cry."
depression,"I had a good day, but it doesn't feel right","Today was good, I had some laughs and was generally not too sad about literally everything and nothing at the same time. But I hate it too. It doesn't feel safe, and it feels unnatural to be okay. I've always had these doubts of whether I do actually have depression or not and good days just make those doubts worse. I know that logically speaking I almost definitely do have depression, but these doubts keep me awake at night. I recently asked for help from my parents because Ive been spiralling really badly lately, it was really hard and all it did was confirm that they'll never truly understand because they've never known what it's like to have depression. But at least I'm going to get a professional diagnosis at some point hopefully. I don't really have much else to say, just needed to vent."
depression,Does anyone else feel like they're impossible to be loved for no real legitimate reason but because of overthinking?,"cuz if so, then im one of those miserable peeps"
depression,"I suffered a lot, I'm still suffering and I can't see the point of being alive anymore","I'm suffering a lot and I can't cope with it or brush it off anymore. I can't even function anymore and I barely get out of bed every morning 
I just want to know what is the point of living if you are someone like me? You barely have friends, no one checks on you, no one gives a fuck about you and your existence. You're an outcast in your society and you can't fit in. I'm 20, almost 21 and I already tired of being alive and I want it all to be over as I'm so behind in everything and I'll never be good enough for anything. I'm tired of trying so hard for stuff that others (usually terrible people) get on golden plate and without any effort
What's the point of living if you're all alone? What's the point of living if there is no god up there and there is no afterlife where you'll find some peace from your shitty life on earth
I just want to die, that's it. I don't want to be happy anymore and I don't want to ""get better"" fuck it it isn't worth all the pain I just want to die
If the odds are always against me then why should I play this game?? This life sucks and I'll never bring kids to this world I don't want them to suffer like me"

depression,My self hate is just soo strong,Please don’t tell me to try thinking differently because when I do it just gets overrode. I just wanna die so bad because I can’t do anything right. I don’t want quarantine to end because I secretly like everyone being sad about not going out because then I don’t have to feel bad I have nowhere to go/no friends anyway. But from next week people can see each other but I have no one to see. I want somebody to take my life. I wish I could take my own life
depression,Celexa: is cold chest pain/burn normal?,"I’ve been on celexa for about 2 weeks and the last few days I’ve experienced depressed moments where I got chest burn.

depression,"I’ve been thinking about my childhood. (TW: Suicide, Cutting)","I’m only 18 turning 19 in around 3 months and still live with my parents, but I mostly stay at my boyfriends house due to having separation anxiety with him and other personal issues. I became depressed when I was 12. Life’s never felt the same since then, and it’s only gotten worse. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts and cutting, and occasionally thought of overdosing on the sleeping pills I take, I don’t think I would ever actually do it, but it’s still a thought I get.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about my childhood. I really miss being a kid, everything was so much easier. Whenever I think about it, I feel sad. Not because it was horrible, I was lucky enough to have a nice childhood. The reason why I feel sad is because I can’t go back. I feel like I took those moments for granted and I can never feel that happy again. Does anyone else feel like this?"
depression,I feel unwanted and unloved,"I know a lot of people have it harder than me but my life sucks, I've been single my whole life and I've been rejected more times than I can remember, it's always ""you're a good friend and nice but we'll never be more than friends"" then they go and meet somebody and don't talk to me anymore. 

When I message girls I like I'm always left on read, I get short replies and I'm ignored some of the time, I feel so unwanted and I'm already told ""I love you"" but I'm not showed it in any way shape or form and whenever I rant about my feelings it's always ""don't be so hard on yourself you're a great guy"" or ""Don't be like that"" jeez thanks I didn't think about it like that /s.

I genuinely feel like I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life and I have no hope whatever in being in a happy relationship and even if I am I'll fuck it up by being insecure and clingy.

I want to kill myself so fucking bad but I'm too scared to do it and I know my parents and friends would be upset even though I literally only have 4 friends and out of them only 2 are close with me.

I just wish I could be happy and be with somebody who feels the same way as I do without fucking it up by pushing them away."

depression,I read something once as a kid,"I remember reading something in a fiction book once as a child. I don't remember what book it was, but a guy in it said that he believed that every time we go to sleep we wake up in a different life or different world, and that all of the memories of life we have were just made that morning. I wish that were true. I'm so tired of trying to hard to make my life bearable but being too pathetic and lazy and worthless to actually make it happen. It would be so nice for this version of me to stop existing, for me to forget everything that's happened in my life, to get a new life that might actually mean something, a life full of love and happiness and meaning and adventure. I wish that's what would happen tonight, instead of me waking up over and over in this fascimile of an existence. I'm just so tired of being me and doing this every day. I just want to be someone else."
depression,Friend at risk of self-harming, She couldn't promise me not to cut. I can't meet with or talk to her  over this weekend due to a very possessive boyfriend for whom she  self-isolates.

depression,It’s my birthday and im breaking down,"Venting here: I just needed somewhere to write my feelings and post it. Everything I’ve been holding emotionally in the last month is just fucking me over. All the stress and lack of love. And on top of it all I got pulled over, just a warning but still Im someone who will cry over even little stuff like that. I’d write everything out but it would just be so hard to understand and take too long. 

TLDR: my mom got scammed out of 6 dights from someone who worked at a company and I’ve been trying to fix it. Her house is molded in the basement and I didn’t realize how bad it was until the company started doing some of the work to make up for what that employee had scammed her of. I’m stressed out about how much more this will be and how bad the situation is. I have this huge grudge on her for not paying attention and hiring a company without any contract.

I just want someone to hold me and let me cry and fall asleep. I understand as you grow older your birthday doesn’t feel like it’s your birthday and just another day but the big 21 for me makes me feel like it is. And it hurts even worse that I’m feeling like this today of all days. Time to go drink and eat my feelings tonight."

depression,Looking For Help,"Firstly, I will say I talk about suicide in this so be warned.

Hello, I hope this type of post is allowed, if not I’m sorry, I just really don’t know what to do. I’m in a relationship and my partner has really bad depression and anxiety. She doesn’t work because of it, has no insurance or help, only me. 

Last night, while I was doing homework and getting ready for finals, she was downstairs tying a rope, that she planned on using on herself. She had a set of my kitchen knives as well. This isn’t the first time. Many times, while I’m at work she threatens it, and as much as I’d love to rush home and save her, I’m unable to because I’m at work and I’m out only provider. I know she doesn’t want to live, she’s told me this many times. But I don’t believe this is the answer, I want to get her help. My problem is, I’m not sure 100% if she wants it and it’s not like I can forced her to get help (even though I wish I could).

Unfortunately we live in the USA and the healthcare system is a mess. I’m going to call as many places today and try and get information that can lead to getting her help, and starting the process of that. I’m going to get as much information as I can and present it to her, and hope she makes the decision to try and get help.

I’m posting on here, partly to help, but also partly for information. I’m not sure what I can do exactly, and not exactly sure who to call or talk to. I was hoping maybe I could get some advice here"
depression,The thought of coming out of this lockdown scares the shit out of me,"I have no goals or confidence, I’m not interesting or good at anything. Some people talk to me but I’m convinced they do it just to feel good about themselves or that they feel bad for me. My looks are below avg and I genuinely have nothing to offer a business, my friends or family, I’d be better off if I just stayed living in quarantine"
depression,"I feel like my life is coming to an end, if not, it's just going to get worse. I haven't felt true respect in months.","TLDR at bottom. Wednesday was my 20th birthday, and for some reason I was really under the impression that things would be better. But things aren't getting better, and I'm not talking about Corona. If I'm being honest, I say that I want Corona to go away, but I'm only really saying that because it's the right thing to say, but I know that I don't believe it. I just don't want my normal life back. The chaotic environment we're all a part of now seems somehow way more manageable than whatever the fuck was going on before. And besides, people have less time to hang out with me, so it all works out, and that's not sarcasm. Recently all I've wanted was a day. Maybe 2 days, but I just need some time where noone is talking to me, noone is asking me for my weed, noone is asking me for backrubs or to play video games with them, and noone is telling 3 hour stories about something I don't care about. I hate faking interest but I will to make you happy. I'll do anything to make you happy and it's killing me. I decided to get my first apartment ACROSS THE HALL from one of my best friends for some reason. Surprise surprise. I come home from work, sit down, and my door opens with my friend in toe. He doesn't understand that I just need to rest and whenever I tell him he says ive been avoiding him and are starting to hang out with him less. If I refuse to play video games with him/go to the store/say hi to his pet, he basically just won't leave me alone until I go. He'll just shake me or gently kick me nonstop until I get up. Not to mention that he's too worried about keeping weed in his apartment (understandable, it's a smoke free complex) but he has no issue leaving it at my apartment in the same complex, and just coming over 35 times a day to come smoke. I don't have privacy. Everyone just uses me. This one time my coworker asked if I had any weed on me, and I said yeah. He asked if it was cool if he brought this other worker, I said no because I'm almost out and my S/o hates too many people in the apartment at once. When he showed, he completely didn't listen and brought the other coworker too, and this coworker has no respect for me. Literally yesterday I got off work, and she said ""OP I'm gonna go to your house and take a chop"" when I asked what she meant, she just said that she'll be over 20 minutes after work.  When I said that it might not work out, she just said she'll make it quick. Now I have no weed. Because everyone but me keeps fucking smoking all of it. I haven't even smoked like at all in the past week because I've been working all the time, and when I get home it's always fucking gone and I have to buy more bc my S/o got laid off due to Corona so they've been home alone a lot, and also my friend comes over to smoke my weed, and my co-workers do, and my S/o does, and basically what I'm saying is that In a week i spend $150 for about 2 bowls worth of weed, I pay $750 a month for an apartment that I can't lock and isn't a home because people will want to come over. I work 40 hours a week with people who only fucking use me. I haven't wanted to tell a story or share thoughts or think much as all or anything lately because I've been everyone's dump bin lately, and people have just been telling me lots of really heavy shit lately without considering the fact that I might just not be in the right mental space for it. I have really bad bipolar. People know this. Of course they don't give a fuck and tell me shit anyway. I don't even want to talk to my S/o right now I just want to fucking shoot someone for their weed to I can fucking smoke and then dip into the mountains until every crumb of it is gone. I just want to lock my apartment and have it be quiet without expecting a knock every 30 minutes, and it's not like I can ignore it. He'll just keep knocking until I open it and if I say I'm tired or just need some time or something like that, he'll just say ""not good enough"" and pull me out anyway. Why can't people just leave me alone. Why the fuck am I the neighborhood tool. Why the fuck am I the dumbass who gives away weed and money. I just want to be able to truly have control of my finances rather than being expected to buy the weed for all my friends and s/o. Why am I so stupid. I work so much. My friend doesn't even have a full time job and he's 21 with a fucking life and a girlfriend. He seems happy. I just want to cry. I fucking hate this life and whoever decided to let me be born has a really fucked up version of ""funny"". I am walking pain and I WANT TO CLAW MY FUCKING FACE OFF KILL ME I KNOE THAT I WILL NEVER PURPOSFULLY TREAT ANYONE BADLY AND I FUCKING HATE THAT ABOUT MYSELF. I. WANT. TO. DIE. 


TLDR noone respects my space, my home, my thoughts, my finances, my worries, basically I'm the family doormat."
depression,Microdosing,Has anyone ever tried micro dosing LSD to treat stubborn depression?
depression,Empathy will be the death of me,"I don't need people. I do not need one single person. I appreciate the people around me, but I can live without them. My own parents think I'm ""cured"" of depression because I'm not showing any signs. For their sakes, I don't tell them that I feel like shit half the time. I can't break their hearts in this already difficult time.

But I see someone saying they're touch hungry. That they're lonely. That they want friends. And it rips a hole in my heart. I wish I could sacrifice my being so that someone who deserves better can get to live better.

I don't deserve my life. Too many wasted opportunities. Too many failures. It's a curse to live on for others. It's a curse to keep trying for something. It's a curse to see someone in pain. It's like some days I want to feel nothing again, like I did before."
depression,New Meds being discussed after my phone assessment with Mental Health Team," I  have a 90min phone assessment with the psychiatrist of my local mental  health team yesterday and she is proposing I look at 3 medications to  change to from my current 90mg Duloxetine which is no longer effective.

Does anyone have experience with any of these?

Vortioxetine

Agomelatine

or

Quetiapine (this is an anti-psychotic which would be used in very small dose to increase the power of the AD)"
depression,Woken up today and I feel myself struggling to keep this front up,"Don’t really know what to say, I’ve never posted anything like this before since I prefer to keep everything bottled up and put a confident happy front on. But today I’ve woken up and I’m struggling to do every day tasks, I don’t want to talk, have zero energy and feel like I’m going to burst into tears at any moment. 

I feel as if I look like I’m crying for attention or something by posting on here. As I know there’s people on this sub reddit who are struggling a lot worse than what I am. 

Just wanted to know if this will pass? I’ve been struggling with my head for about a year now and i seem to have good patches here and there but then out of no where I feel worthless again. 

I went to a crisis team last October due to how I feel about myself and my life, so they put me on a 72 hour care which didn’t do a lot for me, I didn’t know what to expect from seeking help from them but i didn’t benefit from it. So I decided to leave it so someone else can have a opportunity to seek help. 

I think my issue is I feel so alone in this world. I use to really look up to my dad when I was a kid like I thought he was like god, but I recently turned 21 and realised everything was a lie and we no longer talk. I use to have a big group of friends but after I started feeling like this, one by one tended to steer away from me and start to not include me in activities. Which hurts a lot since I depended on my Friends for taking my mind somewhere else. 

I’m currently stuck at home for another 3 weeks due to the virus which is probably a big factor on how I feel, since going to work for me is an escape from my head. 

I’m sorry if this isn’t the right way of making a post on here, or if some things don’t make sense. I’m genuinely just typing as I’m thinking it in my head. I’m just looking for a way to escape my head if anyone has any ideas. 

Thank you

depression,Can someone take a min or two to listen to a hapless lover boy vent?,"Hey, I'm a 18y/o who likes a girl. But past few days I haven't been feeling so good... The same girl is a good friend of mine who has schizohreffective BPD disorder and I talk to her online mainly (different countries). 

Tbh I messaged her originally because I felt like she needed a Friend and someone to talk to. As time went on tho and we got talking more I fell for her..I told her that but she said we'd be better off friends. Blow to the ego but that's ok. She's been the best friend I could've had.. lately tho,ever since Covid,she's been difficult and has been getting mad more and more. 

We had a arguement two days ago and we hashed it out (kinda) yesterday. But I sent a few messages and she hasn't checked them at all..it's weird because I'm her FP,so she usually responds when she's up.. in all honesty it's just flared my depressive episode more and I feel as though she's gone... I actually like the girl,I'd say I love her too...for all her quirks she's perfect to me... 

Before you say I'm overreacting the thing is I was looking at old messages and I accidentally went on her profile and saw her snapscore shoot up by 6..so she's ignoring me(?)...

I could use someone to talk to tbh..."

depression,I want the end,"I'm 40. I lost about 8 months ago everything. My husband got arrested while I was on a with our 5 years old son. We lived in Dubai. UAE was my country for the past 16 years, most of my adult life. I lost every, my home,my family, my life. My husband is all alone in a jail in Dubai,still under ""investigation "" for the past 8 months. I came back to my home country, penniless, with our 5 year old son. I got a job as a ground staff at the airport until covid hitted and now I'm jobless again .I don't get along with my parents, they are constantly criticizing and putting pressure on me. I'm done..I want an end to all this. I'm aware of what I'm leaving behind, call me a coward,selfish, whatever..I m soooo tired and I just can't do it anymore. I don't have any financial resources and I don't seem to find any more solutions to all this. I want to fly,to surrender, to vanish,I want to wipe out my name and my prints forever q"

depression,A message I sent to someone. Thought I'd get some more opinions.,"Hey, I was talking to some friends and I was telling em some shit. And like its 100% proof she cheated, then I was like oh fuck. I remember some shit she str8 up lied about...so it hit me today and I feel better like ah I don't need that bitch but I need help with how to not care what she's doing in her life. Like thinking of her dating someone else makes me mad, I dont like the idea of her fucking other people. It pisses me off. Just that shit in general. Just because I was kind of rejected and a bit of  an outcast.

So now I'm sitting here thinking about shit. The person who told me all this and showed me I want to now ask shit? I don't even know if she lied or stretched the truth with ehay she was saying. Because I did piss her off by being persistent. She said 2 things. About a guy named nick, she said that she talks about him and hooks up with him all the time..and she said ""I know this because she tells me how massive his cock is and how great sex is with him"" I literally tried to kill myself because of that sentence

 so now im obsessing over this other girl because I want to ask if thats really true, if she is a size queen, and ugh. I don't know what i want. I wang too feel satisfied with my own fucking body. Not look at other people and need constant validation. Or the constant fear that girls will get bored of me sexually, mentally? That would hurt but I'm being me, im trhing my best to be my best personality. But my best body and my limits I can't accept. I need serious help with this. In obsessing. Its the core

Cause of all my shit. I actually talked about some deep ass non personal shit today and thats the 1st step in noticing im bringing happy / stable. I just need to knock this stupid shit. And once I do fuck yeah. Hell i think I can be fully healed but Lonley in a month or 2

I'll miss someone wanting me and all that, like people waiting on me, but that will come in time. I made some hella good progress today

I also want to text my ex ""now I see clearly now""

And depending on how she responds ill just say
What do you mean?
 ""I can't control your actions or decisions. You are your own person, i know..i know"" 

Then stop texting her forever

Its petty but I want her to know I know. But she already knows I dont trust her and suspect it hella. Hella. But now that I'm like 100% I want her to know, because I still care about her? No, I just want her to know, i got used to talking to her. Reporting to her.



Not sent to my friend:

I dont feel thick enough. I dont feel interesting enough anymore. I feel like even when I workout and get buff I could always have a 6.5 with a 5.5 and be way better off. 



Fuck im so unstable but aware. So maybe stabke but broken insecure."
depression,Why am I still here?,"It's been just over 4 months since I lost all will to live. I've been trying so hard to carry-on. I'm only here cause I worry how people I know will react to me ending my life. I've dealt with severe depression for a long time now. I'm 41M. About 16 months ago I met my soulmate. The moment I first saw her I knew there was something special about her. I could tell she felt it too. The time we shared together was like something out of a dream. So easy and effortless. I proposed to her after about 3months and of course she said yes. From being told that there was no love in the world like hers for me and so on and that we were destined to be together. Then 2 months later out of nowhere she went all cold and basically ghosted me. Wouldn't even speak to me. After all the beautiful times and words we shared, to be treated like a stranger has really messed up my head. The pain I go through every day is magnified by the fact she wouldn't even tell me why. It's almost like I'm an empty shell of a human. I know they say actions speak louder than words, but to not even have the decency to talk to me about it just doesn't make sense at all. The human I thought I knew would never treat another human like this let alone me. I honestly don't know how to keep going anymore. She was my reason to live that I had been looking for, for a long time. I can't really talk to anyone about it cause all they say is ""you'll be ok, time heals all wounds"" blah blah blah. I went and got some rope, and I've tied a noose, I'm hoping I am strong enough to get through this but I severely doubt it"
